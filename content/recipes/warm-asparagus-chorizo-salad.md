ingredients:
- "===VINAIGRETTE==="
- "35 ml white wine vinegar"
- "25 ml extra virgin olive oil"
- "5 ml Dijon mustard"
- "7 ml honey"
- " pinch sea salt"
- "freshly cracked black pepper"
- "===SALAD==="
- "500 g thick asparagus, trimmed"
- "15 ml avocado oil"
- "1 cured pork chorizo sausage about 120 g"
- "20 halved grape tomatoes"
- "25 ml fresh chopped flat leaf parsley"
instructions:
- "===VINAIGRETTE==="
- "1. Whisk vinegar, honey, mustard, salt, pepper until emulsified; stream in oil slowly while whisking. Set aside at room temp. Should be loose but cling well."
- "===SALAD==="
- "2. Heat grill to high; oil grates briefly to avoid sticking. Toss asparagus with avocado oil, season lightly with salt and pepper."
- "3. Place asparagus perpendicular to grill bars – keeps them from falling through. Grill for about 6 minutes, turning with tongs so all sides develop char marks; crispy but tender with bright green snap."
- "4. Meanwhile, grill chorizo over direct heat 3-4 minutes per side. Should be sizzling, skins blistered, interior warm and slightly caramelized. Remove from heat, slice thin."
- "5. Chop asparagus into thirds lengthwise or bite-size. Combine with chorizo slices, halved tomatoes, parsley in large bowl."
- "6. Drizzle vinaigrette over salad; toss gently to coat without bruising tomatoes. Taste. Adjust salt or acidity if needed."
- "7. Serve immediately for best contrast of warm asparagus, aromatic sausage, and fresh herbs."
- "===Tips==="
- "Use avocado or grapeseed oil for higher smoke point on asparagus. If no grill, broil on rack 10-12 minutes watching color closely. For chorizo substitution, gently sear thick-cut spicy sausage with paprika and garlic notes. Honey replaces sugar adding depth and slight sticky gloss to vinaigrette."
- "Watch asparagus for that subtle snap; overcooked loses texture and vibrant green color. Chorizo should crisp but avoid drying out – fat content helps flavor and moisture. Tomatoes added at end for freshness and acidity punch."
- "Mixing everything in a large bowl makes dressing easier to distribute evenly. Adjust seasoning last, more vinegar or salt if flavors dull after resting."
introduction: "Grill time comes up fast. Asparagus needs care; too long equals mush, too short and its fibrous. Chorizo cooks quickly, sizzles loud, lets fat render crisp edges. Tomatoes bring color, basil swapped out for parsley for earthier bitterness. Vinaigrette uses honey, not sugar – silkier mouthfeel with subtler sweetness. This isn’t a dainty salad, it’s rustic, smoky, bright – flavors that punch above their weight. You’ll know asparagus done when surface blisters but still snaps fresh. Chorizo signs are crackly skin and fragrant pork fat rendered. Toss warm so vinaigrette lightly melts, coats veggies evenly. Ideal for backyard cookouts or fast weeknight dinner. Old kitchen tricks apply: oil grill bars well, use tongs not fork, chop uniformly for balance in every bite."
ingredientsNote: "Quantities tweaked for better balance — slightly more asparagus to bulk salad, reduce chorizo for less fat overload. Avocado oil chosen over olive for higher smoke point in grilling — avoids burnt off-flavors. Honey replaces sugar enhancing vinaigrette complexity and gloss. Parsley offers deeper herbal tone than basil’s upfront sweetness, plays better with pungent sausage. Tomatoes increased for acid and fresh burst. Should you lack chorizo, any spicy cured sausage with garlic and paprika works. If no fresh herbs available, dried oregano or thyme can substitute but use sparingly to avoid overpowering. Trimming asparagus properly matters — snap bottom ends to discard tough woody parts; can test bend point for freshness. Storage tip — make vinaigrette ahead and keep chilled, whisk just before use if oil separates."
instructionsNote: "Don’t just eyeball timing; focus on visual clues and texture. Grill asparagus perpendicular to grates to avoid slipping through. Oil asparagus well to ensure light charring, not heavy black crust. Turn regularly to get even color and prevent burning. Chorizo cooks fast — listen for consistent sizzle and look for rendered fat pooling slightly under skin. Slice chorizo thin or balanced with vegetable pieces for even distribution. Mixing warm veggies with vinaigrette softens herb aroma but melds flavors deeply. Adding tomatoes last preserves freshness and keeps skin intact. Toss gently, avoid smashing tomatoes. Adjust seasoning last — vinaigrette brightness or salt level can flatten after sitting even a few minutes. If grill not available, broiling with careful attention mimics char but watch closely so chorizo doesn’t dry or asparagus overcooks. Efficient plating means assemble just before serving to maintain textures and temperature contrasts."
tips:
- "Use tongs to turn asparagus while grilling. Listen for that sizzle. Keep an eye on color. Should be charred but not burnt. Even turns mean even cooking."
- "Vinaigrette can sit out a bit. But don't make it too early. Whisk just before dressing salad. Taste and adjust salt or acidity upon mixing."
- "Chorizo cooks fast. Listen to the sizzle. Look for the blistering skin. Shouldn’t dry out, keep an eye. Thin slices distribute flavor throughout."
- "If no grill, use broiler for asparagus. Keep rack high. Cook 10-12 minutes, turning. Check often to avoid mush. Similar char is key."
- "When serving, toss salad just before. Warm asparagus, chorizo, and vinaigrette must meld. Tomatoes at the end preserve freshness and integrity."
faq:
- "q: How to achieve the best chorizo texture? a: Listen for that crisp sizzle while cooking. Shouldn’t dry out. Fat is important. Look for rendered edges."
- "q: Best way to store leftovers? a: Keep salad components separate. Don't dress until ready to eat. Vinaigrette stored cold. Ingredients stay fresh longer."
- "q: What if asparagus is too tough? a: Trim ends properly. Snap off woody parts. Freshness matters. Cook until just tender – that snap is key."
- "q: Can I substitute ingredients? a: Yes, any spicy sausage works. If chorizo’s unavailable, use something similar. Fresh herbs can swap for dried. Use caution."
