ingredients:
- "2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour"
- "1 tablespoon baking powder"
- "1/2 teaspoon baking soda"
- "1 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon"
- "1 teaspoon ground nutmeg"
- "1 cup brown sugar packed"
- "1 1/4 cups apple cider"
- "1/3 cup mashed ripe pear (sub for applesauce)"
- "1/4 cup unsalted butter melted"
- "2 large eggs at room temperature"
- "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
- "---"
- "1/2 cup powdered sugar"
- "1 to 2 teaspoons water"
- "1/3 cup granulated sugar"
- "1 teaspoon cinnamon"
instructions:
- "=== Preparation ==="
- "Oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit exactly. No shortcuts here. Always heat first. Use a light-colored 9x5-inch loaf pan. Parchment paper lines method or classic grease and flour — grease sticks, flour prevents bubble pops. Both work if done right."
- "=== Dry Mix ==="
- "In large bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar thoroughly. No lumps. Even distribution prevents clumps of salt or soda shocking one spot."
- "=== Wet Mix ==="
- "Separate bowl, whisk pear mash, apple cider, melted butter (not hot or eggs will scramble), eggs, vanilla extract. Room temp eggs beat better, incorporate air, avoids dense loaf."
- "=== Combining ==="
- "Fold wet into dry carefully. Not stirring frenzy or gluten-tight fist. Mixing until just combined. Batter looks lumpy but uniform color. Overmix? Bread dense, tough. Under mix? Flour pockets."
- "=== Bake time ==="
- "Pour batter into pan, smooth top with spatula. Slide into oven center rack. Bake 40 to 45 minutes — check early at 38 with toothpick. Insert it in center; it should come out mostly clean but a few moist crumbs attached okay. Glossy wet batter means longer bake needed. Listen for crackling crust sounds near end."
- "=== Cooling ==="
- "Rest 10 minutes in pan. Bread edges pulling slightly from sides means readiness. Invert onto wire rack lined with parchment paper. Cool completely or glaze will slide off — patience important here."
- "=== Glaze ==="
- "Whisk powdered sugar and water until thick paste. Not runny or you lose grip on sugar topping. Brush evenly on top and sides. Paste grips cinnamon-sugar like glue."
- "=== Cinnamon Sugar Top ==="
- "Mix granulated sugar with cinnamon well. Generously sprinkle on glazed loaf. Press lightly to adhere. This crust creates crunch, silky sugar glaze underneath. Cut once glaze sets, about 15 minutes."
- "=== Serving ==="
- "Slice with serrated knife for clean cuts. Bread moist but holds shape. Warm aroma of cinnamon and apple punches from crumb. Best same day."
- "=== Tips and Troubleshooting ==="
- "No pear? Use equal applesauce but drain excess liquid or reduce cider slightly. Overmixed batter? Add tablespoon flour, fold gently. Dry edges? Tent loaf loosely with foil halfway through baking to prevent too dark crust. No cinnamon? Allspice can substitute but lower quantity. Use brown sugar, not packed too tight to avoid dense loaf."
introduction: "Moist, spiced, rustic loaf. Apple cider gives sticky tang while brown sugar keeps crumb supple. Cinnamon doubles as a mix-in and a crunchy topping thanks to simple glaze trick. Pear replaces applesauce for subtle sweetness and extra moisture. Watch dough texture closely. Too wet, heat oven bit longer; too dry, add splash more cider. Fold, don’t stir — fragile gluten chain key to soft bite. Serve warm or room temp. Scent fills kitchen, signals spice level. Crisp cinnamon sugar crust crackles when sliced. Not overly sweet. Just enough fall in every bite."
ingredientsNote: "Brown sugar intensifies flavor and moisture better than white granulated, avoid shortcuts here. Pear is a subtle substitute for applesauce, plus it lends delicate sweetness and smooth texture. Keep wet ingredients room temperature to avoid curdling eggs or shocking butter into solids. Use fresh spices; old cinnamon dulls aroma and taste. Apple cider must be unsweetened for balance. Parchment ensures loaves release easily while greasing and flouring loaf pan prevents sticking but creates distinctive edges. Powdered sugar glaze thick enough to hold sugar topping sure-fire for perfect crust. Substitute water in glaze with lemon juice for added zing."
instructionsNote: "Preheating oven fully critical for even rise and crust color. Light-colored loaf pan allows monitoring bottom browning; dark pans absorb heat too fast, risk burnt crust. Mixing order matters; dry ingredients first ensure even soda and powder dispersal, preventing dense pockets. Folding wet into dry minimizes gluten activation—key for tender crumb. Cake tester or toothpick ideal doneness indicator; count on moist crumbs, not wet batter or dry toothpick. Cooling inverted stops condensation buildup that would sog outer crust. Glazing while loaf hot melts glaze into the crust. Wait until cooled completely so glaze doesn’t slide off. Pressing cinnamon sugar into glaze locks topping. Serrated knife slices loaf clean without crushing crumb. Timing flexible but watch visual cues."
tips:
- "Room temp ingredients make a difference. Butter can’t be hot; eggs should be warm. Impact on batter consistency noticeable. Careful mixing matters. Overmixing creates toughness. Aim for just combined."
- "Glaze needs thickness. If too runny, sugar won’t stick. Adjust water for desired texture. Powdered sugar key here. Always apply glaze when fresh out the oven. Lock in that moisture and flavor."
- "Parchment paper worth using. Helps with loaf release, keeps edges neat. Grease and flour can work. Don’t skimp on these steps. It’s frustrating when bread sticks to pan."
- "Cooking method matters. Keep an eye on bread, listen for cracking crust sounds. If edges darken too fast, tent with foil. It’s flexible for a reason. Get that even bake."
- "Baking time varies. Always check internal doneness earlier. Need just moist crumbs on toothpick, not slick batter. Adjust temperature if loaf looks too wet. Be ready for surprises."
faq:
- "q: What if I have no pear? a: Applesauce works but drain. Use less cider. Pear adds moisture but applesauce does okay. Keep an eye on wetness."
- "q: Why is my loaf dense? a: Usually overmixing. Fold not stir. Gluten development leads to toughness. Add flour slowly next time, folding gently matters."
- "q: Can I make this ahead? a: Yes, cool and wrap well. Store at room temp or freeze. Slice before serving; keeps moisture. Reheat if needed."
- "q: Can I reuse cinnamon sugar? a: Not really recommended. Fresh sugar topping better. But if left over, store sealed. Use in oatmeal or toast instead."
