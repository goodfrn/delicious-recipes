ingredients:
- "600 g  (about 1 ¼ lb) thick sirloin steak or flank steak"
- "1 large ripe mango peeled and thinly sliced"
- "60 ml  (1/4 cup) chopped roasted almonds"
- "45 ml  (3 tbsp) fresh mint leaves finely chopped"
- "45 ml  (3 tbsp) fresh Thai basil finely chopped"
- "1 lime juice only"
- "Olive oil to drizzle"
- "1 pinch crushed red chili flakes"
- "Salt and freshly cracked black pepper"
instructions:
- "Fire up the grill on high. Get the grates clean and well-oiled to avoid sticking."
- "Season the steak generously with salt, black pepper and a light brush of olive oil. You want a slick surface but not dripping fat."
- "Place steak on grill hear that sizzle, grill 4-5 minutes each side. Look for deep crosshatch marks and firm to the touch but with some bounce. We're aiming medium-rare."
- "Remove steak, transfer to a warm plate. Tent loosely with foil to rest 7 minutes. This lets juices redistribute, no dry edges."
- "Slice steak thinly against the grain, notice juices pooling but meat still firm with chew."
- "Spread beef slices on a large serving platter. Scatter over mango slices, roasted almonds for crunch, then sprinkle herbs evenly."
- "Squeeze fresh lime juice all over — the acid wakes up everything. Drizzle olive oil to add a gloss and soften the acidity."
- "Finish with a balanced pinch of chili flakes for heat that lingers but doesn’t overpower."
- "Serve immediately. If no grill, use a cast iron pan screaming hot; sear and follow same rest."
- "For nuts, almonds swapped for chopped lightly toasted peanuts. Mint replaced by fresh cilantro is a nice twist."
- "Avoid overcooking beef. Too well done kills tenderness and steals the salad’s fresh contrast."
- "Herbs can be mixed up depending on season: Thai basil gives licorice notes but regular basil or even tarragon changes profile subtly."
- "Olive oil quality matters here. Bright, peppery extra virgin shows best."
- "If mango too firm or underripe, substitute with ripe peach slices or even ripe pineapple for similar sweetness."
introduction: "Grill time. Listen for the sizzle hitting hot steel. Imagine the Maillard crust forming, aroma takes over kitchen. Meat resting lets muscle fibers relax, trapping those flavorful juices. The mango slices bring a juicy pop, soft and fibrous. Crunch hits — toasted almonds breaking up tender beef. Herbal freshness cuts through richness; lime acid ties all flavors together. Chili flake heat lingers in the background like a subtle whisper. This is no random salad but a deliberate play of texture and flavor contrasting heavy with light, spicy with cooling. Treat herbs like your signature. Each bite tells a story — seasonal, simple, refined. No overthinking. Meat, fruit, herbs — done."
ingredientsNote: "Thick cut sirloin or flank steak are both good. Flank is leaner and needs precise cooking—watch your doneness carefully. Sirloin typically has more fat so more forgiving. Mango ripe and sweet but firm enough so it doesn’t turn to mush when mixed. Roasted nuts for texture, almonds or peanuts both work, just toast them lightly to bring out nutty aromas. Thai basil adds anise complexity but swap mint or cilantro for regional twists. Fresh lime juice is non-negotiable for punch, bottled won’t cut it. Olive oil finish softens acid and enhances mouthfeel. Watch salt quantity depending on meat quality. Freshly crushed pepper better than pre-ground for bright aroma. Chili flakes provide restrained heat; adjust to taste but don’t overpower."
instructionsNote: "Oil grill grates or cast iron before heating to prevent sticking—use paper towel dipped in oil held with tongs. Get grill screaming hot before placing meat to seal juices. Cook steak based on touch test — medium rare feels springy, slight resistance, not mushy or too firm. Rest meat near warm spot loosely tented; don’t cover tightly or trapped steam ruins crust. Slice beef thinly across grain for tenderness, watch meat fibers’ direction. Assemble salad quickly so mango stays fresh, herbs don’t wilt. Dressing is simple — just lime and olive oil mixed in places. Tossing meat directly can bruise mango — layer ingredients on platter separately, drizzle dressing on top. Leave chili flakes out or on side if guests shy from heat. If grilling outdoors impossible, hot pan searing followed by resting identical for results. Avoid prepping too far ahead as mango discolors and herbs wilt."
tips:
- "Preheat grill — get it hot. Check grates, oil to avoid sticking. Look for that sizzle when beef hits. Deep grill marks mean success."
- "Let beef rest. Important step. Seven minutes. Juices redistribute. Don’t skip this, avoid dry beef edges. Tent with foil — not too tight."
- "Slice against the grain. Look for those fibers — don’t cut with them. Thin slices yield tenderness. Juices flowing out, not a dry dish."
- "Consider nut swaps. Almonds bring crunch, but peanuts work well too. Lightly toast either. Releases oils, aromas. Elevate texture."
- "Fresh herbs matter. Garden freshness — mint, Thai basil. Try cilantro instead of mint sometimes. Seasonal variations keep things exciting."
faq:
- "q: What if my beef is tough? a: Try slicing thinner against the grain. Rest well after cooking. Also work on doneness. Medium rare is key."
- "q: Can I use a pan instead of a grill? a: Yes, a cast iron pan is solid. Preheat well. High heat is crucial for searing. Follow same resting rules."
- "q: My mango isn’t ripe enough. a: Substitute with ripe peaches or pineapple. Both give desired sweetness. Adjust lime juice for balance."
- "q: How long can I store leftovers? a: Up to 3 days in fridge, but beef dries out. Consider freezing beef-only or make salads fresh."
