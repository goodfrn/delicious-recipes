ingredients:
- "250 g (7/8 cup) mixed wild mushrooms, sliced"
- "75 ml (1/3 cup) olive oil"
- "50 g (1/3 cup) chopped French shallots"
- "40 g (3 tbsp) unsalted butter"
- "280 g (1 1/4 cups) Arborio rice"
- "125 ml (1/2 cup) dry vermouth"
- "1.1 liters (4 1/2 cups) hot vegetable broth"
- "65 g (1 cup) freshly grated Parmesan cheese"
- "Fresh thyme sprigs, small handful"
- "A few drops of truffle oil (optional)"
- "Parmesan curls for garnish"
- "Salt and black pepper"
instructions:
- "Heat 50 ml olive oil in large heavy-bottom pan over medium-high heat. Add sliced mushrooms, sprinkle salt and freshly ground pepper. Cook tossing for 5-7 minutes until softened and browning. Remove and set aside on plate."
- "Lower heat to medium. Add butter and remaining olive oil. Toss in shallots, cook stirring until translucent and slightly golden, about 4-5 minutes."
- "Add rice, stir to coat grains thoroughly in fat. Cook 1-2 minutes until rice opaque at edges but still firm inside."
- "Pour in vermouth. Stir constantly until liquid nearly evaporated, 3-4 minutes."
- "Add hot broth in increments of 250 ml. After each addition, stir frequently until broth absorbed before adding more. Incorporate thyme sprigs during broth additions for fragrance. Season lightly with salt and pepper."
- "Continue until rice is creamy and al dente, 20-25 minutes total. May need extra broth for desired texture. Remove thyme sprigs before serving."
- "Fold cooked mushrooms into risotto. Mix in Parmesan. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. Add truffle oil drops if using; stir gently."
- "Spoon risotto into warmed shallow bowls. Sprinkle with black pepper. Garnish with Parmesan curls and small thyme leaves if desired."
introduction: "Mushrooms sautéing in olive oil. Butter melting slowly with shallots. Rice gripping every drop of vermouth and broth. Stirring steadily to coax creaminess out of Arborio grains. Thyme sprigs tucked in for green brightness. Cooking method rearranged to coax depth from all components. Truffle oil optional but pungent. Parmesan folded through, ribbons curled on top. Rustic, earthy, with hints of herb. No fuss, no frills, just textures contrasting — chewy mushrooms, soft grains, sharp cheese. The occasional pop of peppercorns. A stovetop ritual. Perfect for a midweek dinner craving something warm, hearty, and just a little bit fancy."
ingredientsNote: "Switched to vegetable broth and vermouth from white wine and chicken broth for flavor tweak and to suit vegetarians. Slightly reduced butter and increased olive oil to alter richness and mouthfeel. Wild mushrooms provide varied textures and intensified earthiness — shiitake, cremini, oyster blend well. Fresh thyme added for herbal aroma and slight woodsy note complementary to mushrooms. Parmesan amounts adjusted; grated cheese used in cooking, curls for garnish, for layered cheese impact. Measuring ingredients by weight improves consistency. Keep broth hot throughout to maintain temp when adding. Season gradually at each stage, better control than finishing at end."
instructionsNote: "Sauté mushrooms separately until golden and moisture evaporated to prevent sogginess. Reserved until final folding to maintain texture. Shallots cooked slowly to build sweet undertone. Coating rice with fats and letting it toast slightly before liquid makes a deeper nutty flavor. Vermouth added at start of liquid phase for aromatic complexity, allowed time to reduce. Broth added gradually in ladles to coax starch release from rice, stirred frequently but gently to encourage creamy texture. Stirring rhythm varied — frequent enough to prevent sticking, not constant to avoid mushiness. Thyme included early with broth so herb infuses gradually, then removed to avoid bitterness. Mixing mushrooms and cheese in at the end prevents overcooking mushrooms and melting cheese into goo. Truffle oil added sparingly to finish, can overwhelm if too much. Final plating with freshly ground pepper and curled Parmesan visually appealing and adds texture."
tips:
- "Use a variety. Shiitake, cremini, oyster. Each adds unique texture. Sauté separately. Keep them firm. Avoid mushiness. More flavor depth."
- "Hot broth, essential. Keeps rice cooking. Not too cold. Rice needs heat to release starch. Helps creaminess. Add gradually for best results."
- "Frequently stir. Helps rice absorb broth. Don't overdo it. Gentle motion to avoid breaking grains. Stir to prevent sticking. Balance is key."
- "Thyme adds aroma. Use fresh. Remove sprigs before serving. Infuses beautifully during broth addition. Too much bitterness if left in too long."
- "Truffle oil. A few drops recommended. Too much can overwhelm other flavors. Adds finishing touch to risotto. Sparkling earthy notes."
