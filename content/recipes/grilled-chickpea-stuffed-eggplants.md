ingredients:
- "2 eggplants approx 400 g each"
- "50 ml olive oil divided"
- "1 medium tomato"
- "1 small head garlic unpeeled"
- "1 can chickpeas 400 ml rinsed and drained"
- "15 ml harissa"
- "5 ml ground smoked paprika"
- "5 ml ground coriander"
- "5 ml ground cumin"
- "1 pinch ground cinnamon"
- "1 small preserved lemon zest finely chopped"
- "Pomegranate molasses to drizzle optional"
- "Fresh mint leaves to garnish"
- "Sauce tahini section==="
- "15 ml tahini"
- "20 ml water"
- "40 ml plain yogurt"
instructions:
- "Preheat grill to medium-high. Oil grill grates well to prevent sticking."
- "Trim eggplants, halve lengthwise. Using sharp paring knife, score crosshatch on flesh, avoid piercing skin. Brush cut sides with 25 ml olive oil. Salt and pepper liberally."
- "Place eggplants flesh side down onto grill along with garlic bulb and whole tomato. Grill 7 minutes or until flesh chars deeply and softens without collapse. Remove eggplants, set aside flesh side up on tray."
- "Turn tomato and garlic, cook further 7-8 minutes until tomato skin blackens and garlic cloves are soft. Remove and let cool slightly."
- "Peel tomato and garlic cloves. Roughly chop tomato and mash garlic with back of spoon. Combine in bowl."
- "Carefully scoop eggplant flesh leaving thin layer to support skin; chop flesh coarse. Add to tomato-garlic mixture."
- "Drain chickpeas, add to mixture. Mash gently with fork, leave texture, not paste."
- "Add remaining olive oil, harissa, cumin, coriander, smoked paprika, pinch cinnamon. Salt and pepper to taste. Fold well."
- "Set cast iron pan on grill, skin side down. Carefully fill eggplant cavities with chickpea mix, mounding slightly."
- "Cover grill, cook 6-7 minutes allowing filling to heat through, eggplant skins to get smoky and slightly softened but holding shape."
- "While that cooks, whisk tahini and water in small bowl until creamy. Add salt and pepper, fold in yogurt till mixture smooth and slightly loose."
- "Remove pan from grill. Drizzle eggplants generously with tahini sauce, add pomegranate molasses if using for sweet acidity."
- "Sprinkle chopped preserved lemon zest and torn fresh mint leaves over top."
- "Serve warm either on board or straight from pan."
introduction: "Burnished eggplants, smoky and yielding. Crisp skin holds a textured chickpea stuffing — not mush, enough bite left. Harissa heat balanced by cool tahini yogurt sauce, that creamy, tangy smoothness. Garlic roasted whole, caramel notes melt in the mix instead of sharpness. Tomato blistered, skin peeled away, adds smoky sweetness. Preserved lemon sparks freshness while cinnamon and paprika weave warm, subtle depth. Pomegranate molasses is a late dot of sweet tart surprise. Grilling here is not just heat, but mastering the smoke, those char marks tell the tale. Patience on the grill, watching flesh soften yet firm, pulling scents on the breeze as time stretches. Twists on tradition, smaller eggplants substitute well—holds stuffing better, cooks faster. Chickpeas: swap for lentils or white beans if needed — texture counts. No fancy molds, just a simple cast iron pan tight to the grill. Minimal oil, big flavor, a vegetarian main that stands tall."
ingredientsNote: "Eggplants around 400 g each work better than giant varieties here; tender but firm flesh sidelines watery disappointments. Olive oil quality shines through—extra virgin, pungent and grassy adds to smokiness. Whole garlic heads roast slowly, cutting their sharp flavor to mellow sweetness; avoid chopping raw as it becomes harsh when grilled quickly. Preserved lemon zest is optional but a game changer; if unavailable, use a squeeze of fresh lemon and a pinch of sea salt. Harissa heat varies by brand, start mild then add more to taste. Tahini can be replaced with smooth almond butter or sunflower seed butter if allergies present; keep water ratio for consistency. Yogurt should be thick, plain Greek style, but coconut yogurt works for dairy-free alternative though flavor differs slightly."
instructionsNote: "Scoring eggplant flesh avoids undercooking while allowing smoky penetration and speed. Keep skin intact so halves hold their shape during cooking and stuffing. Grill until flesh shows deep color changes and feels tender when poked with fork—the telltale sign of done. Tomato and garlic work like aromatics roasted together; peeling after provides no bitterness from charred bits. Mashing chickpeas coarse prevents gluey pastes—texture is key, bite and creaminess balanced. Cast iron pan retains even heat and prevents flare-ups from dripping oil. Grill covered to trap heat and smoke, not just direct flame. Tahini sauce requires slow whisking to incorporate water and yogurt smoothly; too fast and it curdles. Drizzle right before serving so sauce doesn't soak into filling and lose its fresh tang. Pomegranate molasses adds layered flavor contrast but skip if too sweet for palate. Garnish with mint and lemon zest for brightness—avoid over-chopping herbs to keep fresh texture amid warm eggplant."
tips:
- "Grill medium-high, let eggplants char deeply. Don’t rush. Check texture by poking with fork. Skin stays intact, keep it crispy. Roasted garlic softens. A must."
- "For moisture, eggplant flesh stays thin for structure. Press gently while grilling, too much pressure leads to collapse. Rotate for even cooking, flavor enhanced."
- "Chickpeas can swap for lentils if you have them. Texture is critical. Less mush, more bite. Mash gently, fork works. You want chunks, not paste."
- "Use extra virgin olive oil, flavor matters. Quality oil transforms the dish. Pomegranate molasses optional but really adds depth. Try fresh lemon if you’re out."
- "Drizzling tahini sauce last means fresher taste. If too thick, adjust with more water. Smooth yet runny is the goal. Stir slowly for uniform texture."
faq:
- "q: Can I use different beans in stuffing? a: Sure. White beans or lentils work. Mash carefully. Keep some texture. Adjust spices according to your choice."
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. Enjoy within three days. Reheat gently to avoid sogginess. Keep sauce on the side."
- "q: What if eggplants are too watery? a: Choose smaller ones or salt to drain excess moisture. Delay cooking until you see even skin and firm flesh."
- "q: What’s best for grilling? a: Cast iron gives even heat. Other pans risk flare-ups. Aluminum foil works too but check for sticking. Maintain heat control."
