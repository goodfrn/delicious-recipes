title: "Chocolate Brioche Buns"
slug: "chocolate-brioche-buns"
description: "Soft enriched wheat buns studded with chocolate chunks. Yeast-leavened with a buttery crumb, slightly sweet, golden crust from egg wash. Milk helps gluten develop gently, enriched dough yields tender texture. Yeast proofed directly with sugar for activation. Chocolate folded before shaping, adds pockets of melted contrast. Oven heat triggers oven spring, egg wash seals crust color. Visual cues like dough doubling size and shiny brown tops dictate timing. Practical substitutions include plant-based milk and coconut oil for butter. Takes about an hour to rise and bake. Great fresh, freezes well, reheat wrapped in foil to restore softness."
metaDescription: "Chocolate Brioche Buns are soft, yeasted treats bursting with dark chocolate. Perfect for breakfast or snack, not just desserts."
ogDescription: "Indulge in Chocolate Brioche Buns—a rich, buttery treat with melty chocolate. Great for sharing or a personal treat."

ingredients:
- "260 ml warmed oat milk or dairy milk around 40°C"
- "50 ml maple syrup or cane sugar"
- "570 g (about 4 1/2 cups) all-purpose flour"
- "12 ml (2 1/2 tsp) instant dry yeast"
- "4 ml fine sea salt"
- "1 large egg room temperature"
- "100 ml melted coconut oil or unsalted butter"
- "150 ml dark chocolate chunks or chips"
- "1 egg beaten with 1 tsp water for brushing"
instructions:
- "Warm milk until lukewarm, not hot; pour into medium bowl, stir in syrup to activate yeast."
- "In large mixing bowl, whisk flour, yeast, and salt together, distributing the salt well to avoid killing yeast."
- "Add the milk mixture, egg, coconut oil all at once; mix vigorously with wooden spoon or hands until shaggy dough forms."
- "Turn dough onto lightly floured surface; knead about 6 minutes until smooth and elastic—no longer sticky or tearing easily. Dough should stretch thin without breaking: windowpane test."
- "Form dough into tight ball; lightly oil clean bowl, place dough inside and cover with damp towel or plastic wrap to trap humidity; rest for 12 minutes in warm spot away from drafts. Dough will relax but not double yet."
- "Line baking sheet 35x25 cm with parchment paper."
- "Lightly flour work surface; fold in chocolate chunks by kneading them into dough gently but thoroughly, avoiding melting by keeping hands cool."
- "Divide dough into 8 equal portions (~90 g each). Roll each into smooth tight ball by cupping hand and rotating dough against counter. Place spaced evenly on baking sheet."
- "Cover with lightly damp towel or plastic wrap to prevent drying; proof 40–50 minutes in warm place until visibly puffy and nearly doubled in volume. Should bounce lightly when poked."
- "Heat oven to 175 °C (350 °F) with rack in middle. Avoid opening door during baking to prevent collapse."
- "Brush buns gently with egg wash mixture for glossy finish and deeper browning. Avoid excess wash pooling into crevices; sparse but even coat."
- "Bake buns 25–30 minutes. Watch for rounded golden tops, firm springy feel when tapped. Internal temp should be around 90–95 °C if you have a thermometer."
- "Remove from oven; cool on wire rack uncovered to prevent sogginess underneath before storing."
- "For reheating day after: wrap in foil, warm at low temp 150 °C for 10 minutes to restore freshness."
- "Substitutions note: plant-based milk and coconut oil keep richness without dairy. Maple syrup or cane sugar activate yeast similarly to granulated sugar."
introduction: "Brioche starts with good dough fundamentals. Warm milk wakes yeast without scalding; sugar fuels yeast for steady rise. Flour ratio reduced slightly to improve hydration and pliability. Less butter replaced with coconut oil for dairy-free option; melts differently but still enriches. Salt sprinkled last to keep yeast alive. Kneading builds gluten web—knife-edge of over-working but that bounce back means strength. Chocolate chunks tucked in late to avoid premature melt, keeps pockets intact. Proofing demands patience: doubles are slow but reliable. Egg brush creates shine and richness on crust without burning crisply. Oven rack placement critical, prevents overly brown bottoms or pale sides. Watch dough texture over precise timing; dough voice louder than clock. Freshly baked aroma rich with cocoa and vanilla notes, hints of caramelized crust. Your hands best meter if buns are tender yet strong."
ingredientsNote: "Adjust milk temp by feel—a little warmth, no more. Use any neutral plant milk if avoiding dairy: almond, soy, or oat for dairy-free. Coconut oil chosen for mild flavor and richness contrasted to butter, avoids dairy allergens. Maple syrup replacement for cane sugar adds tiny complexity, aids ferment. Flour scooping method affects hydration; spoon-fluff then level is best to avoid dense dough. Salt precision balances yeast activity—too much kills; too little flattens flavor. Egg at room temp incorporates fats better, emulsion stabilizes dough. Chocolate chunk size affects melting ratios; irregular chunks better than standard chips. Egg wash made fluid helps avoid thick patches that crack or bubble during baking."
instructionsNote: "Avoid dry yeast clumps by dissolving sugar first in milk. Use hands for mixing tactile control over speed and gluten feel. Knead until dough passes windowpane test: stretch thin without tearing; signals gluten developed. Rest dough briefly to relax gluten before folding in chocolate gently; avoid aggressive kneading that melts chunks or overly toughens dough. Shape tightly into smooth balls; seams under to prevent cracking or blowouts in oven. Proof in warm, humid space to prevent skin drying, cover dough with damp cloth or lightly greased plastic wrap. Use poke test not timer: dough springs back slowly yet holds indentation. Egg wash with delicate brush strokes, avoid pooling in crevices. Bake constant temperature with no door peeking. Cooling on rack critical to preserve crust texture; foil wrap reheating restores moisture if stale. Too fast proof = pores large and crumb dry; too slow = dense crumb and blunt rise. Learn to feel dough, smell yeast activity, and see color change for best buns."
tips:
- "Warm milk, check temp—too hot kills yeast, too cold slows rise. Just warm, feel for warmth on skin. Use plant-based milk—similar effects, keep texture."
- "Kneading important—6 minutes seems long. Dough should bounce back. Windowpane test—stretch thin without break. Gluten helps dough rise evenly, no tearing."
- "Chocolate chunks mix in late. Hands cool to avoid melting. Create pockets of gooey chocolate. Fold in gently, preserve shape. Avoid over-kneading."
- "Proofing crucial—warm spot, cover dough to prevent drying out. Look for dough puffy—touch test springs back slowly. Timing varies with temp."
- "Egg wash adds shine—brush gently. Avoid pooling in crevices; helps crust color. Don’t skip, but don’t drown in egg. Simple, even strokes work best."
faq:
- "q: How can I fix dry dough? a: Add small amounts of milk while mixing. Knead more if too dry—get a feel for it. Sometimes fluff slowly helps."
- "q: Can I substitute ingredients? a: Yes, coconut oil for butter. Maple syrup for sugar works too. Every change affects flavor—experiment, see what works."
- "q: What’s the best way to store buns? a: Room temp is fine for a day or two. Freeze after that. Wrap well to keep moisture. Stale? Try reheating wrapped."
- "q: Why are my buns not rising? a: Check yeast freshness, temperature too. Dough too cool or dry can stall. Try warm place, or gentle heat from oven off."
