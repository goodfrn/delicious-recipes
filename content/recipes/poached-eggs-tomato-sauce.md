ingredients:
- "300 g zucchini diced as substitute for potatoes"
- "1 small onion finely chopped"
- "50 ml olive oil for cooking"
- "3 garlic cloves minced"
- "1 small bird’s eye chili sliced thin optional"
- "15 ml curry powder high quality blend"
- "10 ml freshly grated ginger"
- "5 ml ground cinnamon replacing paprika for deeper warmth"
- "5 ml ground cumin"
- "200 ml low sodium vegetable broth"
- "1 can 796 ml diced tomatoes no salt added"
- "120 g green beans trimmed"
- "5 fresh eggs"
- "100 ml plain yogurt natural"
- "15 g fresh cilantro roughly torn"
- "Salt and black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Heat oil medium-high in large nonstick skillet. Add diced zucchini and half the onion. Stir occasionally 7 minutes until zucchini edges soften, partial browning visible. Avoid crowding to encourage caramelization not steaming."
- "Add garlic, half the chili, curry powder, ginger, cinnamon and cumin. Stir constantly 1 to 2 minutes until fragrant. You’ll smell spices blooming, no burning. A quick sauté wakes flavor."
- "Pour in broth to deglaze pan. Scrap browned bits, let simmer 2 minutes. Add tomatoes and remaining onion. Bring to gentle boil then reduce heat. Simmer uncovered 30 minutes stirring occasionally. Sauce thickens, shiny, rich smell develops. Reduce liquid but maintain moisture."
- "Add trimmed green beans arranged on top in single layer. Create shallow wells in sauce with spoon for eggs. Carefully crack eggs into wells working fast to keep yolks intact. Cover pan with lid and cook over low heat 6 to 8 minutes. Whites should set but yolks remain soft. Watch closely; overcooked eggs get rubbery. Use squeeze lid if needed to regulate steam."
- "Remove skillet from heat. Dollop yogurt across surface unevenly to contrast acidity and cool richness. Scatter torn cilantro leaves and remaining chili strips. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon directly into bowls, serve with warm naan or chapatis. "
- "Tips: zucchini faster cooking than potato, adjust simmer time if too watery let sauce thicken longer before adding eggs. If no bird chili use pinch cayenne or omit for milder version. Yogurt adds tang; sub with coconut cream for dairy-free. Fresh cilantro adds vibration but parsley works in pinch. If whites lag behind yolks cover tightly and extend steam time by 2 minutes."
- "Common pitfalls: crowding pan—zucchini turns mushy, flavor dull. Too high heat burns spices. Adding eggs at full boil cracks yolks or leads to overdone whites. Watch egg edges; they firm first. Remove heat once whites set for tender texture."
introduction: "Poaching eggs directly in a thick, warmly spiced tomato sauce. The key is gradual flavor layering before eggs arrive — sweat zucchini and onions gently first, coaxing natural sugars and texture. Aromatics wake in hot oil with careful attention not to scorch garlic or ginger powder. Spice mix shifts from paprika to cinnamon, giving a woodsy note often overlooked. Tomato acidity balances richly here. Green beans add crunch and freshness nested just under the eggs. Poaching eggs in sauce differs from poaching water or vinegar — watch white setting and yolk tenderness carefully. Egg timing is everything. Cool yogurt ribbons and fresh cilantro brighten the finished plate. It’s filling, textured, and forgiving if you know how to read texture and smells. Helpful when pantry staples need a twist."
ingredientsNote: "Replacing potatoes with zucchini reduces starch, speeds cooking, and lightens overall texture. You can easily swap green beans with asparagus or sugar snap peas for a seasonal variant, choose fresh or frozen confidently. Cinnamon stands in for paprika, introducing a subtle warmth but skip if you prefer a sweeter or smoky profile; smoked paprika or chipotle powder works too. Use fresh ginger for assertive zing, powdered ginger if pressed for time but fresh always better if available. Bird’s eye chili is optional and can be replaced by crushed red pepper flakes — start small and adjust heat gradually to avoid overpowering the eggs which are delicate. Olive oil is preferred for its flavor and relatively high smoke point but ghee or coconut oil lends a different aroma. Plain yogurt acts as a cooling foil — try Greek yogurt for thicker creaminess, or sour cream if you tolerate dairy well. Cilantro is virtually mandatory to achieve the bright finish but flat leaf parsley or mint offers pleasant alternatives in a pinch."
instructionsNote: "Focus on visual cues over strict timings throughout. Caramelization of zucchini edges signals readiness to aromatics addition—no raw bite here is crucial. Spices blooming means fragrant but not darkened or bitter smell; keep stirring. Deglazing with broth loosens fond flavor bits stuck to pan bottom, improving base depth. Sauce should thicken to a glossy, thick consistency where juices cling to spoon, not watery. When adding green beans, place atop sauce, don’t stir, allowing them to steam gently. Creating cavities for eggs requires a gentle hand — cracking eggs close to the pan surface prevents yolk breakage. Cover pan to trap steam and cook whites evenly, poke whites lightly at edges if unsure. Avoid full rolling boil at egg stage, which screams rubbery whites and broken yolks. Remove pan promptly when whites are set but runny yolks remain. Serve immediately, yogurt melting over hot tomato sauce is signature. Onion and chili garnish added raw add crunch, color, texture contrast."
tips:
- "Watch zucchini color—not mushy, nice browning. Always adjust simmer time for sauce thickness. If watery, keep simmering; flavors deepen."
- "Control the heat carefully—high heat burns spices, ruins aroma. Garlic should smell sweet, not bitter. Stir often, watch edges."
- "Create cavities for eggs gently—crack close to sauce. Don't stir too much after adding green beans, let steam cook them tender."
- "If greens lose crunch or look wilted, add at end. Extra flavor can come from lemon zest sprinkled before serving. Keeps it bright."
- "Backup plan for overcooked eggs? Scramble into sauce—make a quick curry. If yolks break, stir gently; transform mishaps into hearty dishes."
faq:
- "q: How long to simmer before adding greens? a: Depends on thickness. Start checking after 20 minutes. If sauce looking thick, perfect time."
- "q: Can I use frozen green beans instead? a: Yes but adjust cooking time. Add to sauce last few minutes. They get tender quicker."
- "q: What if the sauce is too thick? a: Add a splash of broth. Stir it in. Too thin? Simmer longer. Bring flavors back with time."
- "q: Storage solutions? a: Can refrigerate leftovers for a few days. Reheat gently, add splash water to prevent drying. Freeze for a month."
