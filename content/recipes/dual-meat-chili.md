slug: "dual-meat-chili"
description: "Red beans soaked overnight, pork shoulder cubed and seared, lean ground beef browned with aromatics and spices. Tomatoes and stock combined, cooked under pressure for a rich, hearty chili. Uses cocoa powder and smoked paprika for depth, cumin for earthiness, and jalapeño with optional cayenne for heat. Adapted quantities and swapped chicken broth for vegetable stock, cumin replaced with coriander, adding chipotle pepper for smoky notes. Natural pressure release retains flavor, final seasoning adjustments recommended. Serve over rice, tortilla chips or baked potatoes. Nut free, dairy free, gluten free, egg free. Efficient layering of flavors, textures, and vibrant color with minimal hands-on time."

ingredients:
- "175 g (3/4 cup) dried red kidney beans rinsed and drained soaked overnight"
- "500 g (1.1 lb) lean pork shoulder, trimmed and cut into chunks"
- "2 tablespoons olive oil"
- "400 g (14 oz) lean ground beef"
- "1 large yellow onion, finely chopped"
- "1 seeded serrano chili, minced"
- "3 garlic cloves, minced"
- "3 tablespoons chili seasoning blend"
- "1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder"
- "2 tablespoons smoked paprika"
- "1/2 teaspoon ground coriander"
- "1 can 796 ml (28 oz) diced tomatoes"
- "1 cup vegetable broth instead of chicken broth"
- "1/2 teaspoon chipotle powder substituted for cayenne pepper optionally to taste"
instructions:
- "Soak beans in plenty of cold water, keep submerged, at room temperature for 8-12 hours. Drain and rinse. Skipping soak requires longer cooking; plan accordingly."
- "Heat pressure cooker on Sauté or browning mode. Add olive oil, increase heat slightly until shimmering but not smoking. Season pork with salt and black pepper. Brown pork on all sides, about 5 minutes total. Doesn’t have to be cooked through, just color. Remove pork, set aside. Don’t overload pan; do in batches if needed to avoid stewing."
- "Add ground beef to pot, break up with wooden spoon. Brown thoroughly, about 4 minutes until no pink remains and some crust develops. Season lightly. Stir in chopped onion, serrano, garlic. Stir constantly until onion translucent, about 3 minutes—listen for gentle sizzle, smell garlic aroma."
- "Add chili powder, cocoa, smoked paprika, coriander. Stir briskly, toast spices for 30 seconds to bloom flavors. Adds complexity and deepens sauce color."
- "Pour in drained beans, pork chunks, diced tomatoes with juices, and vegetable broth. Stir to combine, scrape brown bits off bottom carefully to avoid burn warnings."
- "Lock lid. Set pressure cooker to Bean/Lentil function or Manual on High Pressure. Adjust timer to 40 minutes for fully softened beans and tender meats."
- "Once cooking cycle completes, let pressure release naturally for 20 minutes. Sharp hiss fades to silence. Patience pays here; fast release risks tough beans and liquids spurting out."
- "Remove lid carefully. Stir, inspect beans—they should split slightly but hold shape. Texture creamy without mushiness. Check pork chunks tender, shreddable with fork."
- "Taste and correct seasoning with salt and pepper. Add chipotle powder for smoky heat or more if you like it fiery. If sauce too thin, simmer uncovered on Sauté setting until desired thickness."
- "Serve piping hot on white or brown rice, with corn chips or stuffed baked potatoes. Garnish with chopped cilantro, lime wedge if desired to brighten."
- "Leftover chili refrigerates well, flavors deepen overnight. Reheat gently, add water or broth if too thick."
introduction: "Beans swollen from the soak, plumped, ready to hold flavor. Fat trimmed pork cubed, browned over moderate heat, proteins sealing their juices; don’t crowd pan or you’ll stew instead. Ground beef crumbled and seared till browned, no pink in sight. Aromatics chopped finely—onion, serrano, garlic—all hit the hot oil to release enticing smells, started to soften before spices join in. Chili powder, cocoa, smoked paprika—spices toasted briefly, releasing oil and intensifying depth. Tomatoes and broth adding liquid boundary for pressure cooking; the sealed vessel will coax beans tender and pork melting. After cook, do not rush pressure release; natural vents beads of steam slowly escaping, flavors marrying quietly. Season to final taste, spice level personal. Serve layered on starch or with crunch. Leftovers richer next day. This is the kind of chili with body — dense, layered, boldly flavoured."
ingredientsNote: "Soaking beans overnight is non-negotiable for even cooking and digestibility unless you use canned legumes—rinse well. Pork shoulder is key here for its marbling and cut richness; avoid lean pork loin or you’ll miss fat melting. Ground meat should be lean but not ultra-lean; a little fat improves mouthfeel. Serrano adds fresh heat different from dried chili powder. Substitute chipotle powder for cayenne to add a smoky note if you want a twist rather than just more heat. Cocoa powder is essential for that dark complex background; natural unsweetened only. Chicken broth replaced here with vegetable broth—vegan friendly and less overpowering. Smoked paprika chosen over sweet because it matches with chipotle for smoky layers. Fresh garlic always better than powder for punch and aroma. Olive oil best choice for sauté; otherwise neutral oils."
instructionsNote: "Soaking beans overnight does two things simultaneously—reduces gas-causing compounds and shortens cooking time. Use cold water, keep beans submerged with a plate or small bowl if needed. Browning pork precedes mixing of other ingredients to build flavor through Maillard reaction; brown bits left at bottom are precious and should be deglazed. Don’t skip removing pork before cooking beef or you’ll crowd pan and steam instead of sear; results in bland color and texture. Toasting spices activates oils and compounds that create flavor complexity—don’t throw them in raw. Release pressure naturally or beans remain firm and tough. After releasing, test a bean by squeezing—should be soft but not exploded. Adjust thickness by simmering without lid if needed, because pressure cooker liquids do not reduce much during cooking. Final seasoning critical—season lightly before cooking as tomato and broth dilute but adjust after. Use chipotle powder cautiously—smoky heat can dominate. Cool leftovers skimming fat layer isolates flavor and improves texture after reheating."
tips:
- "Use soaked beans for even cooking. Add salt after flavors meld. Check doneness by squeezing beans—should not burst but have a slight give. Don’t skip this or you could end up with firm beans too tough."
- "Don’t crowd when browning meats. Do it in batches for a good sear. Key for flavor! Brown bits left in the pot? Important! Deglaze them for rich depth in sauce. Skip this and lose flavor."
- "If sauce feels thin after cooking, reduce by simmering. No lid! This helps thickening. Cooking time might vary—pressure cookers vary in power. Watch for bubbling and adjust timing."
- "Use chipotle powder for a smoky kick, but be cautious! Too much heat can overpower. Blend spices well before adding beans to ensure even distribution. Heat builds through layers."
- "Feel free to substitute meats. Ground turkey works, but texture will change. Avoid using too-lean proteins; they lack fat for that depth. And as for beans—pinto beans also work well."
faq:
- "q: Why are my beans still hard? a: Soaking is vital for proper cooking. If you skip soak? Add extra cooking time but results may vary. That could impact texture."
- "q: Can I use canned beans instead? a: Absolutely. Drain and rinse. Add during the last 10-15 minutes. Adjust seasoning. Skip soaking; timing changes. Note the texture might differ."
- "q: What if the chili is too spicy? a: Add dairy to mellow heat—sour cream or yogurt on top. Another way? Sweeten with sugar or honey. Balance flavors to your liking."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate up to 5 days in an airtight container. For long-term—freeze! Make sure to cool before sealing. Helps maintain flavor and texture."
