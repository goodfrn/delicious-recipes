ingredients:
- "200 g (3 cups) broccoli florets"
- "1 small shallot, finely minced"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) unsalted butter"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) all-purpose flour"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) dry white wine"
- "450 ml (1 3/4 cups) whole milk"
- "2 packages 245 g fresh gnocchi"
- "300 g sea scallops, patted dry"
- "100 g aged cheddar cheese, grated"
instructions:
- "Set oven rack center. Preheat oven to 220 C (430 F)."
- "Boil salted water. Drop broccoli 1:15 min. Drain. Shock in iced water. Drain well. Set aside."
- "In 25 cm ovenproof pan, medium heat, melt butter. Sauté shallots till soft, about 2 min."
- "Whisk in flour, cook 1 min stirring constantly. Pour wine, then milk. Bring to gentle boil whisking."
- "Add gnocchi. Lower heat. Simmer 6 min, sauce thickened, gnocchi tender but firm."
- "Fold in scallops and broccoli. Salt and pepper to taste. Stir evenly."
- "Sprinkle cheddar over top."
- "Bake 7 min to melt cheese. Switch to grill, brown cheese for 3 min. Watch closely."
- "Rest 5 min before serving. Optionally pair with fresh green salad."
introduction: "Broccoli blanched fast, no mush. Should stay vibrant, snap still there. The shallot softens slow in butter, almost dissolving. Flour comes next, thickening, no lumps, just weight. Wine and milk heat, bubble slowly, turn sauce creamy. Gnocchis soak it, simmer gently till al dente. Scallops—dry, fresh—folded in with broccoli, plump, juicy. Cheese tops the whole mix, melting, browning under direct heat. A quick bake, then a grill blast. Five-minute wait after oven, important. Flavors combine but each thing still stands out. Good for fast but rich meals, seafood-led comfort. No nuts, no eggs, all simple forcing, done."
ingredientsNote: "Broccoli trimmed to smaller florets blanched just over a minute to keep brightness. Shallots minced fine, almost melting into butter. Butter quality matters here, no margarine. Prefer unsalted for control. Flour adds body, cook out raw taste—no skipping or sauce bites. Dry white wine sharpens, can swap for vermouth. Milk brings creaminess, whole milk best. Fresh gnocchis faster than frozen, so used less quantity. Scallops patted totally dry, helps sear texture, not stew. Swap gruyere for sharp aged cheddar for punch. Cheese grated fine so it melts evenly and browns quicker. Ingredients balanced: cream, tang, seafood, greens, starch all present."
instructionsNote: "Preheat set high oven 220 C for fast cooking and browning. Broccoli in boiling, salted water, timing critical, shock in ice water to stop cooking and keep color. Shallots sweated in medium heat to avoid color, soft texture, no crunch. Flour added then quickly cooked minute to avoid rawness; whisk constantly to avoid lumps. Wine adds acidity, add gently to avoid curdling milk. Milk warmed in slowly. Simmer with gnocchis means gentle heat, careful stirring to keep from sticking or breaking gnocchi. Folding scallops and broccoli in at end preserves texture; scallops cook through in residual heat later. Cheese sprinkles cover surface evenly. Bake wrapped in ovenproof pan to melt cheese properly, switch to broil mode for quick gratin. Rest important for juice settling before serving. Serve with salad for fresh contrast."
tips:
- "Gnocchi should be fresh, not frozen. Fresh cooks quicker. Short cooking avoids mushy bites. Look for firm texture when cooked."
- "Keep broccoli bright. One minute in boiling salted water, then straight to ice. Stops cooking fast. Crunchy is the goal."
- "Shallots add depth, sweeter than onions. Minced fine, almost melting. Sauté slow, medium heat. No browning, just soft."
- "Use dry white wine, it balances flavors. Can swap with vermouth if needed. Pour slowly to avoid curdling. Whisk in carefully."
- "Cheese tops this right. Grate fine for even melting. Aged cheddar works but can try gruyere too. Got to cover surface fully."
faq:
- "q: How to ensure scallops don’t get rubbery? a: Pat dry, helps texture. Fold in last for gentle cooking. Residual heat works."
- "q: How can I store leftovers? a: Keep in airtight container. Fridge up to three days. Reheat gently to avoid drying out."
- "q: Can I substitute gnocchi? a: Yes. Pasta works, but cooking time differs. Adjust based on pasta type. Fresh is better when possible."
- "q: What to serve with this dish? a: Fresh salad pairs well. Greens balance richness. Try a light vinaigrette for contrast."
