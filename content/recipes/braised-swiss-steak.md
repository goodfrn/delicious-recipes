slug: "braised-swiss-steak"
description: "Cubed steak bites, seasoned with paprika and garlic powder. Dredged in cornmeal for a crispier crust. Seared in vegetable oil till golden edges emerge. Deglazed with beef broth and mushroom soup instead of brown gravy mix; diced fire-roasted tomatoes bring smoky depth. Long, slow simmer under lid brings fork-tender meat, about 65 to 90 minutes. Adjust heat to keep gentle bubbling, not rolling boil. Serves 4 hearty portions. A dish built on layering flavors and textures, no shortcuts on browning or simmering times. Classic meets smoky twist. Reliable comfort food with slight edge."

ingredients:
- "1 pound cubed steak"
- "1 teaspoon seasoned salt"
- "1 teaspoon smoked paprika"
- "1 teaspoon garlic powder"
- "1/2 cup cornmeal"
- "2 tablespoons vegetable oil"
- "1 cup beef broth"
- "1 can (10.5 oz) condensed cream of mushroom soup"
- "1 can (14.5 oz) fire-roasted diced tomatoes with juice"
instructions:
- "Season cubed steak evenly with seasoned salt, smoked paprika, and garlic powder. Spread cornmeal on a plate. Dredge each steak piece to coat well, shake off excess cornmeal. Cornmeal gives crunch and brown crust, different than flour but works better with this protein type."
- "Heat vegetable oil in a large heavy skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Test oil by dropping a pinch of cornmeal; it should sizzle immediately. Place steaks carefully without crowding. Sear about 3-4 minutes per side. Look for deep golden crust forming with small dark spots. Avoid burning; reduce heat slightly if crust blacks."
- "Remove seared steaks onto plate. Pour beef broth into hot pan; hear the spit and scrape browned bits from bottom with wooden spatula. Those bits are flavor gold."
- "Add condensed cream of mushroom soup and fire-roasted diced tomatoes with juices. Stir to combine, breaking up soup clumps so sauce is even but thickens slightly."
- "Return steaks to pan. They should nestle in sauce, partially submerged. Bring all to lively boil then immediately lower to bare simmer. Cover tight with lid."
- "Simmer for 1 hour 10 to 1 hour 20 minutes. Check once at 50 minutes for tenderness: pierce with fork, meat should feel breaking down but not mushy. Sauce will thicken; if too thin, uncover last 10 minutes to reduce."
- "Remove lid at finish and inspect steak texture; juices coated, tender with slight resistance. Sauce rich, chunky bits of tomato visible. If sauce seems bland, stir in pinch of black pepper or hot sauce at end."
introduction: "Forget instant fixes. This Swiss steak approach demands patience but rewards with punchy, fork-cuttable meat and a sauce that sticks to your spoon. Cornmeal crust delivers crackle, not just bland dusting. Swap out the usual brown gravy packet—its flavors are cardboard next to real mushroom soup and fire-roasted tomatoes, which bring umami and smoky fire without complicated prep. Searing forms the foundation here; that crust is non-negotiable. You’ll hear the sizzle and smell that deep Maillard caramel hitting the pan, signaling flavor building. Simmer low, cover tight, watch the sauce thicken, meat soften. Timing’s flexible; better to check and feel than guess by clock. Happens best in a heavy pan with a lid you trust. Rest of the meal falls around this gem. Practical Southern muscle-food technique you’ll use again."
ingredientsNote: "Cubed steak is tough but worth the slow cook; choose thicker cuts with good marbling when possible. If cornmeal isn’t on hand, you can revert to flour, but expect a duller crust—cornmeal’s grit helps chew and color. Seasoning with smoked paprika adds depth beyond salt and pepper; it's subtle smoke without charcoal flare. Swap brown gravy packets for cream of mushroom soup; more natural flavor and thicker mouthfeel, no weird powder taste. Fire-roasted diced tomatoes bring a gentle heat and char notes. If unavailable, use plain diced tomatoes plus a dash of smoked paprika or chipotle powder for smoky kick. Vegetable oil preferred for searing due to high smoke point; olive oil will burn too fast here. Keep seasonings balanced; mushroom soup contributes salt, so adjust before serving. Always have extra broth on hand—too thick sauce is fixable on stove but too thin is tougher."
instructionsNote: "Searing is critical; don’t rush. Oil hot enough when you hear immediate crackle on contact. Layer seasoning well and dredge properly to avoid clumps. Removing steaks after crust prevents steaming that ruins texture. Deglazing with broth loosens all the browned goodness locked in pan—scrape thoroughly. Adding mushroom soup replaces gravy packet; it thickens sauce naturally and imparts richness. Fire-roasted tomatoes should be stirred in gently to preserve chunks and smoky flavor. Simmering with tight lid traps moisture for tenderizing tough muscle fibers; avoid boiling or harsh heat that toughen meat. Stirring during simmer is unnecessary, even disruptive; only check midway to confirm doneness. Adjust thickness at end by uncovering sauce; add a pinch of cayenne or black pepper if needed for brightness. A final rest 5 minutes uncovered lets sauce settle and flavors marry before serving."
tips:
- "Season well, layer flavor deep. Mix spices well, let steak soak in. Cornmeal is key; gives crunch, browning. If out of cornmeal, flour works but less bite. Take your time searing. Listen for crackle when steak hits the pan."
- "Check for tenderness halfway through. Fork should sink in but not mush. That’s the goal. If it’s not there, let it go longer. Simmering needs low, steady heat; don’t rush with high temps. Watch for sauce thickness at the end."
- "Sauce too thin? Uncover for last few. Reduce it down. Stirring not needed during simmer—it disrupts. Just let it sit. Let ingredients mingle, sauce thicken. Check closely near the end; spices can become muted."
- "Substitutions can be made easily. Fire-roasted tomatoes give smokiness, regular tomatoes plus smoked paprika work too. If mushroom soup not on hand, sour cream can add creaminess as a last resort. Just balance flavors."
- "Resting at the end? Critical. Five minutes lets the sauce settle. Flavors marry together. Texture improves after a breather. Keys to success? Patience; good results take time and care in cooking."
faq:
- "q: How to ensure steak doesn’t get tough? a: Slow and low cooking is critical; high heat toughens meat. Check doneness frequently. Tender means fork should slide in easily."
- "q: What if sauce tastes bland? a: Adjust seasonings last bit—pinch of black pepper or hot sauce can elevate flavor. Check from bottom of the pan too; flavors settle."
- "q: Can I use different cuts of meat? a: Yes! Tough cuts like chuck or round work best; they break down nicely. Just needs longer time, be patient."
- "q: What about storing leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container, great for up to three days. Can freeze too; but sauce may thin out. Reheat gently."
