description: "A quick one-pot meal combining chicken thighs with jasmine rice and fresh veggies. Sauce made with tamari and maple syrup adds a deep, slightly smoky note. Cooking under pressure locks in tang and sweetness but use the natural release time to avoid dry chicken. Stirring rice post-cooking ensures even fluffiness. Steamed snap peas and sautéed broccoli offer crunch and color. Sriracha replaced with chili garlic sauce for a balanced heat. Cornstarch slurry for sauce thickening stops thin drips and builds glossy coating. Adjust vinegar to apple cider for a mild tang. Balance wet and dry ingredients for no-soggy rice in the pot. Serves four hearty bowls."

ingredients:
- "1 cup soy sauce"
- "1 1/4 cup water divided"
- "2 Tbsp rice wine vinegar"
- "1/4 cup maple syrup"
- "2 tsp grated fresh ginger"
- "3 cloves garlic minced"
- "1 tsp chili garlic sauce"
- "2 Tbsp olive oil divided"
- "2 large boneless skinless chicken thighs"
- "1 cup diced carrots"
- "1 1/4 cup jasmine rice rinsed"
- "1 1/4 cup low sodium vegetable broth"
- "1 1/2 cups broccoli florets chopped"
- "1 red bell pepper diced"
- "1 cup snap peas"
- "1 1/2 Tbsp cornstarch"
- "2 Tbsp cold water"
- "2 green onions sliced"
- "1 Tbsp toasted sesame seeds"
instructions:
- "Whisk soy sauce, 1 cup water, rice wine vinegar, maple syrup, ginger, garlic and chili garlic sauce in a bowl. Reserve 3 Tbsp sauce for instant pot later. The rest goes for veggies and thickening."
- "Heat 1 Tbsp olive oil in the Instant Pot base by selecting sauté mode, then off. Nestle chicken thighs in pot. Pour reserved 3 Tbsp sauce over top along with carrots, rinsed jasmine rice and vegetable broth. No stirring; just gently tap edges to submerge rice. Make sure rice grains stay separate."
- "Close lid firmly. Turn sealing valve to sealed. Cook on HIGH pressure for 8 minutes. Let timer count upward an extra 12 minutes natural release — this keeps chicken moist, avoids chewy texture. Patience helps here."
- "While Instant Pot is working, prep veggies. Heat 1 Tbsp olive oil in skillet over medium heat. Toss in broccoli, bell pepper and snap peas. Splash 1 Tbsp of the earlier sauce on veggies. Stir semi-frequently until broccoli shows deeper green, just tender yet still crisp — about 6 minutes. Avoid overcooking or losing that snap."
- "Transfer remaining sauce to small saucepan. Over medium low heat, whisk cold water with cornstarch slurry first. Slowly pour slurry into sauce while stirring. Bubbles form as sauce thickens to slick glaze, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat promptly or sauce gels too thick."
- "Valve switch to venting slowly to release extra pressure. Lift lid away from face to avoid steam burns. Chicken should shred easily or cube up with tongs."
- "Fluff rice gently with fork in pot — careful not to mash. Spoon rice into bowls. Top with chicken and sautéed veggies. Drizzle thickened teriyaki glaze liberally. Garnish green onions and sesame seeds. Serve hot. Resist adding more salt; soy sauce brings salty punch already."
introduction: "Pressure cooking—fast, hands-off, locks in flavor. Chicken thighs used for juiciness, thighs survive longer cook times better than breasts that dry out fast. Jasmine rice rinsed well before cooking cuts starch, keeps grains separate under pressure. Maple syrup swap over honey for round amber sweetness, slightly deeper. Chili garlic instead of sriracha adds more complex heat with garlic undertones. Measuring liquids carefully prevents sticky messes or underrcooked grain. Sauté veggies separately to preserve crunch and vivid colors. Thickening sauce last step. Watch sauce consistency vigilantly or you lose gloss and texture. Seasoning on final plating lets control salty or sweet balance. Green onions and sesame seeds for classic texture contrast. Simple, direct, no fluff."
ingredientsNote: "Soy sauce can be replaced with tamari for gluten-free. Vegetable broth adds subtle depth versus plain water. Maple syrup dial sweetness lower or swap light brown sugar at same ratio. Use chicken thighs over breasts for better moisture in pressure cooker. Rice must be well rinsed till water runs clear to remove extra starch—avoid gummy texture later. Replace rice wine vinegar with apple cider vinegar or lemon juice in pinch. Fresh garlic and ginger preferred but powdered versions fine; increase slightly if using dried. Chili garlic sauce for heat; use red pepper flakes or sriracha if needed but adjust quantity. Cornstarch slurry critical to thicken sauce after, no gelatinous lumps if whisked properly in cold water. Olive oil works here but neutral oils like avocado or canola can substitute."
instructionsNote: "Whisk all sauce ingredients well in bowl—once sugars dissolve, flavor balance improves. Reserve portion before mixing in Instant Pot for layered flavoring. Do not stir rice and liquid in pot, just level off and submerge rice gently—gives even cooking and avoids sinking rice at bottom where it could burn. Seal lid tightly and check valve position critical to build proper pressure. Natural release protects chicken texture—quick release juicy breasts, but thighs do better slow. Sauté veggies just until broccoli brightens and softens; overcooking kills color and crunch. When thickening sauce, cold slurry and steady stirring at low simmer helps properly build viscosity without lumps or over-thinning. Remove from heat as soon as glossy sheen achieved. Carefully open lid post-depressure to avoid steam burns. Shredding chicken while hot easier, rest pulls moisture back inside meat fibers. Fluff rice gently after pressure cooking for maximum separation and attraction. Serve immediately or grains clump as they cool."
tips:
- "Rinse rice well until water runs clear. Cuts starch. Keeps grains separate. Avoid mushy texture later on. Key step for fluffy rice. Don't skip it."
- "Pantry swap—maple syrup instead of honey for a deeper sweetness. Works well in sauces. Adjust measurement slightly if needed. Flavors balance nicely."
- "Natural pressure release protects chicken from drying. Wait 12 minutes after cooking finishes. Scary at first but worthwhile. Juicy chicken, every time."
- "For sauce thickening, cornstarch slurry is essential. Mix cold water with cornstarch thoroughly. Avoid lumps. Add slowly to sauce while whisking. Consistency is key."
- "Sauté veggies until just tender. Keep vibrancy. Too soft? Lose color and crunch. Quick cooking in skillet. Adjust time based on preference."
faq:
- "q: What if chicken is dry? a: Natural release helps. If dry, try brining next time. But overcooking also leads to dryness. Adjust pressure time."
- "q: Can I use brown rice instead? a: Yes, but modify cooking time. Brown rice takes longer, add extra liquid, adjust pressure time. Seek texture balance."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool quickly and refrigerate. Up to four days. Freezing is good for long-term, but grains might clump. Reheat slowly."
- "q: Need more veggies? a: Absolutely, throw in what’s fresh. Zucchini, asparagus work well. Adjust cooking times on softer veggies to avoid mush."
