ingredients:
- "190 g rice flour"
- "8 ml baking powder"
- "5 eggs, separated and room temp"
- "180 g maple syrup"
- "80 ml coconut oil, melted"
- "2 oranges, zest grated"
- "45 ml lime juice"
- "1 ml salt"
- "2 drops orange gel food coloring"
- "Garnish: 375 ml coconut cream, chilled"
- "50 g powdered sugar"
- "Candied orange peels or zest"
instructions:
- "=== Cake ==="
- "Place oven rack mid-level. Preheat to 160 C (320 F). Line bottoms of 2 20 cm springform pans with parchment. Do not grease sides — helps cake climb and hold shape."
- "Sift together rice flour and baking powder into a bowl. Rice flour gives a more delicate crumb but watch for clumps."
- "In large bowl, whisk yolks with half maple syrup until color brightens slightly, about 1 min. Add coconut oil, zest, lime juice, salt, coloring. Mix till just combined — don't overwork or batter collapses early."
- "In separate clean bowl, beat egg whites with electric mixer on medium speed till frothy, add remaining maple syrup gradually while upping speed to high. Whip till stiff peaks hold shape but not dry or grainy. Stop at shiny glossy peaks."
- "Fold one-quarter of meringue into yolk mixture gently to lighten batter. Use rubber spatula and scooping folds, not stirring. Then fold remaining whites in 2 additions carefully, preserving bubbles. Avoid overmixing or deflating."
- "Divide batter between pans, smooth tops with spatula. Tap pans lightly on counter for air bubbles. Bake 33 to 35 minutes. Surface should be springy to touch, clean toothpick comes out with moist crumbs. Golden edges start pulling from pan slightly."
- "Invert pans onto wire racks immediately to cool completely, about 3 hours. Leaving in pans traps steam, makes soggy texture."
- "Run sharp knife along pan edges before removing sides to avoid cake tearing."
- "=== Assembly ==="
- "Chill coconut cream overnight or at least 6 hours. Spoon off thickened cream into mixing bowl. Whip with powdered sugar on medium speed until forming soft peaks. Overwhipping breaks cream down to oily residue."
- "Slice each cake horizontally into two even layers with serrated knife to get four layers total. Take your time for neat slices."
- "Place one layer on serving plate. Spread a generous dollop of whipped coconut cream. Repeat stacking and cream layering."
- "Use offset spatula or large angled spatula to spread a thin crumb coat around sides and top — a naked cake look but prevents crumbs mixing with final cream layer."
- "Decorate top with candied orange peel strips or extra zest for fragrance and crunch."
- "Store under cake dome or airtight container in fridge up to 3 days. Bring to room temperature for 20 minutes before serving for best texture."
introduction: "Orange cake with a light, spongy texture. Not the usual wheat flour base — swapped to rice flour, less dense, whispy crumb. Maple syrup instead of sugar, more natural, subtle caramel notes. Colors pop with little orange gel. Egg whites whipped firm but shiny, folding technique critical here — deflate and flop messes up rise. Coconut oil makes crumb tender without weighing down. Lime juice cuts sweetness, adds brightness. Cream topping switched to coconut, dairy-free, thick and luscious. Decoration minimal; candied peel adds chew and spark. Timing flexible but watch the visual cues — springy cake top, clean skewer pull. Let cool fully inverted, patience pays off. If stuck on whipping whites, add tiny pinch cream tartar. If using wheat flour, reduce by 10%."
ingredientsNote: "Rice flour gives a delicate crumb but can clump; sift well. Maple syrup sweeter than sugar so reduced quantity but adds moisture—can swap for agave or light honey if preferred. Coconut oil for richness but vegetable oil or melted butter works, adjust quantities slightly. Lime juice adds acidity to balance sweetness; lemon juice fine substitute but changes flavor slightly. Gel food color optional for visual impact, drops suffice, avoid overuse or batter bitterness. For garnish, candied orange peel is store-bought or homemade by simmering zest in sugar syrup. Coconut cream must be full fat and well chilled to whip; refrigerate can overnight, or substitute chilled heavy cream if no lactose concern. Powdered sugar eases incorporation without grit. Egg whites must be at room temp for max volume—cold whites whip unevenly and generate large air bubbles that collapse easily."
instructionsNote: "Line pans with parchment but do not grease sides; cake climbs better this way. Whisk yolks with half sweetener until slightly paler — signals some sugar dissolution. Fold whites gently—biggest mistake is stirring, causes batter to deflate and cake to sink. Cake done when top springs back slightly and toothpick inserted comes out with moist crumbs, not dry. Avoid opening oven in first 20 minutes to prevent dome collapse. Invert cake pans immediately after baking; residual heat and moisture cause sogginess if cooled upright. Use serrated knife for clean horizontal cuts; stabilize cake between cuts with fingers or plate. Whale on cream but stop before it breaks into butter—stable peaks hold stacks well. Thin layer of cream around cake keeps crumbs in place yet gives torn-naked cake look typical in modern patisserie. Chill cake before slicing for easier cutting and less crumb scatter. If coconut cream unwhips or splits, add cold and try again or stabilize with a pinch of cream of tartar. Store refrigerated but bring to room temp before serving to fully release aromas and soften crumb."
tips:
- "Sift rice flour, can clump. Avoid using too much at once, check for lumps before adding to batter."
- "Egg whites must be at room temp. Cold means less volume. Small pinches of cream of tartar help if struggling with peaks."
- "Watch baking time; if overbaked, results in dry cake. Toothpick should have moist crumbs; ignore dry. Timing vary with ovens."
- "Use light touch when folding batter. Don’t stir. Gently scoop and lift. Mixing can deflate whites; ruins texture."
- "Coconut cream needs chill time. Full-fat required. Must whip properly; if it won’t whip, try again with cold. No need for added sugar."
faq:
- "q: What if cake collapses? a: Overmixing is the main cause. Watch folding technique. Fold slowly, big scoops deflate."
- "q: Can I substitute rice flour? a: Alternative is gluten-free all-purpose flour. Texture may differ; reduce slightly, adjust for density."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep in airtight container up to three days. Or chill in cake dome, protects moisture. Let sit before serving."
- "q: Why is my cream oily? a: Overwhipping coconut cream breaks it down. Keep whipped to peaks; stop before turning butter. Needs patience."
