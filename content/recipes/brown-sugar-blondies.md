title: "Brown Sugar Blondies with Creamy Swirl"
slug: "brown-sugar-blondies"
description: "Dense bar cookies with brown sugar and a rich cream cheese swirl. Uses light brown sugar and buttery dough base; swapped white sugar for coconut sugar to add depth. Cornstarch added for chewiness replacing some flour. The cream swirl—cream cheese plus dulce de leche—for unexpected caramel notes. Bakes on middle rack until golden, cracks form. Visual cues for doneness are more reliable than timer. Soft edges, slightly springy center. A dessert that fixes itself when you overbake it—but watch those edges. Easy sub: butter for ghee, cream cheese for mascarpone; tweak sweetness to taste."

ingredients:
- "240g all-purpose flour"
- "30g cornstarch"
- "5g baking powder"
- "1g salt"
- "150g unsalted butter melted"
- "180g light brown sugar packed"
- "90g coconut sugar"
- "2 large eggs room temperature"
- "10ml pure vanilla extract"
- "115g cream cheese softened"
- "40g dulce de leche"
- "50g powdered sugar sifted"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven 175C on center rack. Line 9x9 pan with parchment, edges hanging for easy removal. Melt butter till just clear, no browning. Mix sugars into warm butter. Whisk eggs and vanilla quick; temper into sugar butter mix, avoid scrambling eggs."
- "Sift flour, cornstarch, baking powder, salt into a bowl; stir to combine well. Fold dry into wet in two additions, minimal mixing; don’t overwork or toughens."
- "In separate small bowl, whip cream cheese with powdered sugar until creamy but no overbeating to avoid graininess. Fold dulce de leche gently, swirl barely mixed—pockets of caramel to come through."
- "Dump half blondie batter in pan. Dollop half cream cheese swirl in drops, then rest batter, then remaining swirl on top in random blotches. Run a knife or skewer deep swirls—look for ‘marbled snake’ pattern, not full mixing."
- "Bake 30-35 min. Watch edges blister and start to brown, dry crackled top, slight jiggle still in middle. Jiggle test key. If too stiff, over. Needs a bit of tremble under finger. Crackling sound on surface, aromatic caramel, nutty butter scent fill kitchen."
- "Remove, cool 20 minutes on rack before slicing. Texture tight but moist. Cool longer for cleaner slices. Store airtight; bring to room temp before serving for best chew. Can freeze wrapped, thaw 2hr ahead."
- "Sub butter clarified for nuttier depth or ghee if in pantry. Coconut sugar subs white to reduce brightness, add earthiness; all brown sugar for sweeter, softer. Cream cheese can swap mascarpone; dulce de leche shift to caramel sauce or maple for different profile."
- "Common pitfall: overmixing blondie batter kills tenderness. Underbaking: edges firm but center gooey, fine if mild jiggle intact. Overbaking dries them; use lower oven rack if crust too fast, cover if needed. Use parchment for clean release and no scraping butter spots off pan edges."
- "No mixer needed except for cream cheese blend; fold and whisk mostly. Rest eggs to avoid separating batter; cold eggs yield rubbery crumb. Batch can rest 5 min before baking to relax gluten; skip if short on time. Crisp edges come with cooling; slice only when cooled or crumbly mess."
introduction: "Dark brown sugar melting into hot butter, air thick with caramel notes. Swirling cream cheese dollops like trapped pockets of silk in dense dough. Crackling heat from oven, edges turning golden brown—snap of crisp top under fork. The jiggle test ruling how done. Blondies dense, chewy, not cakey. Less sugar than classic for restraint; coconut sugar contributes a woodsy tone. Cornstarch keeps them tender, adds chew. Cream cheese and dulce de leche swirl brings unexpected twist—sweet richness balanced by slight tang from cheese. No fluff here—simple ingredients, precision in mixing, timing flexible if you know the tells. Overbake, rescues with buttered moist crumb; underbake—gooey center will hold. No guesswork if you hear that oven hum and smell the sugar browning. Practical, straightforward dessert bars with a creamy caramel signature."
ingredientsNote: "Modifying sugars shifts texture and flavor. Coconut sugar lowers sweetness, adds earthy notes; substitute brown for more traditional. Cornstarch included to mitigate toughness that comes from quick baking, traps moisture. Using melted butter ensures even texture and richer flavor—cold butter breaks the batter apart. Cream cheese soft but not warm—softened enough to mix but firm to avoid runny swirl. Dulce de leche adds browned milk sugar flavor but can be swapped with caramel sauce or maple syrup for variations. Powdered sugar in swirl levels sweetness and smooths texture. Vanilla extract from quality source matters; skip imitation. Flour measured by weight for consistency—eye measurement leads to dry or heavy blondies. Salt is small but vital to balance sweet and deepen overall flavor. Rest eggs before use to prevent curdling in warm butter mixture."
instructionsNote: "Start with butter melted and warm to dissolve sugar evenly—hot spots cause lumps. Whisk eggs separately so you can temper them into warm fats—avoid scrambled bits. Fold dry ingredients gently; overmixing toughens with extra gluten. The rear of the spoon is your friend for light mixing. Swirl with knife tip, not full mixing, to trap visual pockets of flavor. Watch for color changes on edges, they darken first. Middle jiggling under finger signals near done; carryover cooking finishes them. Cooling is crucial—hot blondies are fragile, slice too early and crumble; duration depends on air temp and pan. Use parchment for easy removal and cleaner edges. Leftovers keep best sealed; refrigeration stiffens but is fine—bring to room temp before serving to soften butter. Common problem: too hot oven burns edges before center cooks – move rack or reduce temp slightly. Overbaking leads to very dry blondies; underbaking leaves them gooey but forgiving if slightly jiggly in center."
tips:
- "Watch your butter. Melt till clear but no brown bits. Ensures even mixing. Warm fat helps incorporate sugar without lumps. But don't rush; lumps are stubborn. Whisk eggs separate; temper them. Use a guide for swirling. Knife tips work for marbling—don’t overdo it."
- "Check for underbaking first. If edges firm but center has jiggle, fine. You're close. If middle's stiff, risk dryness ahead. Moisture pays off. Use parchment! It eliminates stickiness. Just lift them out; no mess. Saves scraping."
- "Get your eggs to room temp. Cold ones toughen batter. Short rest improves fluffiness—don’t skip that. Cornstarch adds chew; it’s key. Swirl should be textured, pockets of cream and dulce de leche. Don't overmix; tender is what you're after."
- "Consider substitutions strategically. Butter for clarified for nuttier notes. Cream cheese can switch to mascarpone for richness. Coconut sugar lends earthiness; swap all brown if preferred. It balances sweetness well. Baking's flexible; keep an eye on visual cues."
- "Cooling is crucial here. Cut when cool for neat slices. Warm blondies crumble. Storage? Airtight containers work best. They hold moisture, prevent drying. Can chill; soften before serving. Dough can rest too—relaxes gluten, helps with tough bites."
faq:
- "q: What's the jiggle test? a: Gentle poke in center—it should tremble a bit. Stiff indicates overbaked. Check edges too; they tell if it’s cooking evenly."
- "q: How to fix overbaked blondies? a: Moist butter can rescue it. Drizzle melted butter over top. Add warmth back. Keeps texture closer to ideal."
- "q: How to store blondies? a: Airtight containers seal freshness. Room temp works best. If too firm, let sit outside for a bit. Avoid refrigerator if possible."
- "q: Can I change sugars f or flavor? a: Sure! Coconut sugar reduces brightness, adds depth. All brown maintains chewiness. Just know textures shift slightly too."
