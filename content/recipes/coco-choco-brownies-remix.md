slug: "coco-choco-brownies-remix"
description: "Brownies layered with coconut filling and topped with rich ganache. Uses partly swapped flours and sugar types for texture variance. Coconut mix sweetened with evaporated milk replacing condensed. Ganache uses bittersweet chocolate for balance. Adjust bake times ±3 minutes relying on toothpick test for gooey center. Key: paper-lining pan so removal's clean. Chill ganache longer if too soft. Store airtight; lasts 4 days at room temperature. No nuts here, but toasted coconut flakes can add crunch."

ingredients:
- "=== Coconut Filling ==="
- "120 g (1 1/4 cup) unsweetened shredded coconut"
- "75 ml (1/3 cup) evaporated milk"
- "=== Brownie Base ==="
- "60 g (1/2 cup) whole wheat pastry flour"
- "50 g (1/2 cup) Dutch-processed cocoa powder, sifted"
- "1 ml (1/4 tsp) fine sea salt"
- "2 large eggs"
- "90 g (1/2 cup) coconut sugar"
- "85 g (1/3 cup) light brown sugar, packed"
- "110 g (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, melted and cooled"
- "=== Ganache ==="
- "160 g (5 1/2 oz) bittersweet chocolate (60-65%), chopped"
- "125 ml (1/2 cup) heavy cream 35%"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) unsalted butter, softened"
instructions:
- "=== Prep and Oven ==="
- "Set oven rack center-height. Preheat to 175 °C (350 °F). Butter 20 cm (8 inch) square pan thoroughly. Line with parchment paper strips, leaving overhang on two sides for easy lift. Butter parchment as well."
- "=== Coconut Filling ==="
- "Combine shredded coconut with evaporated milk - no excess wetness, not pasty. Set aside."
- "=== Dry Mix for Brownies ==="
- "Whisk whole wheat pastry flour, sifted cocoa, and salt in a bowl. Important: whole wheat adds nuttiness & chew; sift to avoid clumps."
- "=== Wet Mix ==="
- "In separate bowl, beat eggs briskly with both sugars. Look for pale, slightly thickened mix, grainy sugar dissolves later. Pour in melted butter, mix till fully homogeneous."
- "Fold dry into wet gently but completely. Don’t overmix — gluten develops, tough brownies. Half the batter spread evenly in prepared pan."
- "Layer coconut sheet on top evenly, pressing lightly to settle but not mix. Add remaining brownie batter on top; smooth surface carefully with spatula."
- "=== Baking ==="
- "Bake about 27-33 minutes. Test doneness with wooden skewer: should come out with moist crumbs, not wet batter or perfectly clean. You want fudgy texture, not dry cake. Listen for gentle crackling sounds from edges; slight pull from pan sides is good sign."
- "Cool brownies fully in pan on wire rack—about 1 hour. Warm pan complicates handling ganache."
- "=== Ganache ==="
- "Pile chopped bittersweet chocolate in medium bowl. Heat cream and butter in small saucepan just to boiling—not rolling; bubbles form at edges, not fully violent boil."
- "Pour hot cream mixture over chopped chocolate. Wait 2 minutes silently. Do not stir yet, let chocolate soften evenly."
- "After 2 minutes, stir gently with spatula from center outward. Should become glossy, thick, shiny ganache."
- "Smooth ganache carefully over cooled brownies. Let set at room temp for 1 to 1.25 hours till firm but not hard. Ganache should hold shape if touched lightly with spatula tip."
- "Optional: Chill ganache-topped pan in freezer 15-20 minutes if in hurry, easier to cut cold."
- "=== Serving and Storage ==="
- "Lift brownies out using parchment edges. Place on cutting board. Slice into 16 equal pieces using sharp knife wiped between cuts to prevent crumbs sticking."
- "Store in airtight container at room temperature maximum 4 days; refrigeration dries brownies and dulls ganache shine."
- "=== Pro Tips ==="
- "Can swap evaporated milk in coconut filling for sweetened condensed if more sweetness desired but reduce sugars in batter by 10-15 grams to balance. Thinner coconut layer will bake through better. For nutty crunch, top coconut cream layer with toasted coconut flakes before applying remaining brownie batter."
- "Substitute canola or light olive oil for melted butter if preferred. Will change flavor and texture subtly but still dense fudgy base."
- "If ganache separates or grainy, whisk in small warm cream spoonfuls slowly or gently reheat over warm water bath while stirring."
- "Avoid overbaking. The slight jiggle in center signals fudgy interior. Using metal pan rather than glass speeds baking; adjust accordingly."
- "If using high altitude, reduce oven temp 10 degrees and extend bake by 3-5 minutes."
- "Whole wheat flour addition improves moisture retention but too much toughens. Stick to this ratio."
- "Parchment paper lining is essential—prevents cracking and helps removal intact without edges scraping pan."
- "When folding dry into wet, fold with spatula edge, not vigorous stirring. Less gluten = tender brownies."
- "Ganache layering slows moisture loss from brownie. While soft ganache is tempting, set time critical for clean slicing without smearing."
- "Cooling at room temp is superior to fridge for texture preservation. If fridge used, allow cut brownies to warm 15 minutes before eating to soften ganache."
- "Be mindful of fresh coconut shreddings moisture content if substituted fresh for dried. Reduce liquid accordingly or bake longer for structure."
introduction: "Brownies with coconut. Not just any combo—layers set you apart. Sweetness balanced by bittersweet ganache and slight chew from whole wheat flour. Moist coconut filling cuts through fudgy base. Watch the textures: skewer tells all. Overbake? Tough edges. Undercook? Gooey pits. Ganache sets like a dream, soft but firm enough to slice, no dragging knife. Parchment liner lifts out brownie square like a pro move; saves scrubbing and prevents tears. Every step earns its keep, from mixing to layering — technique beats fancy ingredients. The kitchen smells like cocoa, butter, toasted coconut soon enough."
ingredientsNote: "Switch from all-purpose to whole wheat pastry flour for subtle nuttiness and better moisture retention. Coconut sugar adds mild caramel notes; swap brown sugar for less if too sweet. Evaporated milk replaces condensed milk here, less syrupy but still creamy; adjust sugars accordingly. Use good quality bittersweet chocolate (60-65%) for ganache, prevents overpowering sweetness and keeps balance with coconut layer. Butter must be unsalted and neutral, allowing ingredients’ natural flavors through. Shredded unsweetened coconut for texture without added sugar, fresh coconut would add more moisture—adjust liquids if fresh. Substitutions with olive or avocado oil work but change texture slightly—stick with butter for traditional fudgy crumb. Sea salt sharpens cocoa flavors, never skip."
instructionsNote: "Oven thermometer recommended for accuracy; uneven heat leads to inconsistent brownies. Complete preparation steps sequentially but handle batters gently—fold, don’t beat. Spreading first brownie layer gently, then coconut filling ensures even layering; avoid mixing layers or coconut will sink, ruin structure. Bake times given as ranges; rely on skewer test: moist crumbs cling, toothpick not perfectly clean. Cooling fully in pan crucial —warm brownies crumble and ganache won’t set smooth. Ganache benefits from resting undisturbed to develop sheen and firm texture. Rapid chilling risks condensation and dull appearance. Cutting clean squares best done with cooled, slightly firm ganache—wipe your knife often. Store airtight to preserve moisture and ganache sheen; refrigeration tends to dry brownies and dull chocolate shine if stored too long."
tips:
- "Layering is key here. Press coconut filling gently. Not too hard; don't mix layers. Smooth brownie batter on top, keep it separate."
- "For crunchy bites, toasted coconut flakes on coconut layer work well. But keep an eye on oven. Coconut burns easily."
- "Testing doneness, skewer comes out with moist crumbs. Not dry. Slight jiggle in center means fudgy interior. Listen for crackling."
- "Cooling fully in pan is essential. Don’t rush. Warm brownies fall apart, ganache won’t set right. Wrap in parchment instead of foil."
- "Ganache too soft? Chill longer. Know when to use freezer. Sets quicker but may affect texture. Ideal room temperature is key."
faq:
- "q: What if brownies are too crumbly? a: Look at mixing. Overmixing can toughen. Ratio of flour's important. Adjust slightly."
- "q: Can I use fresh coconut instead? a: Yes but moisture content varies. Adjust evaporated milk. Bakers need to adapt."
- "q: How do I store these brownies? a: Airtight container best. Up to 4 days at room temp. Avoid fridge. Dulls flavor."
- "q: What if ganache isn't shiny? a: Check cream temp before pouring. If grainy, warm gently while stirring. Quality chocolate matters."
