ingredients:
- "=== Cake ==="
- "900 ml (3 3⁄4 cups) all-purpose unbleached flour"
- "16 ml (3 1⁄4 tsp) baking powder"
- "2,5 ml (1⁄2 tsp) fine salt"
- "250 ml (1 cup) unsalted butter softened"
- "125 ml (1⁄2 cup) canola oil"
- "600 ml (2 1⁄2 cups) granulated sugar"
- "10 ml (2 tsp) almond extract"
- "6 large eggs"
- "300 ml (1 1⁄4 cups) whole milk"
- "125 ml (1⁄2 cup) sour cream"
- ""
- "=== Filling & Topping ==="
- "900 ml (3 3⁄4 cups) 35% whipping cream"
- "180 ml (3⁄4 cup) maple sugar"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) almond extract"
- "1,2 litre (5 cups) fresh blueberries"
- "Zest of 1 lemon"
instructions:
- "=== Cake ==="
- "1. Rack in middle of oven. Preheat 175 °C (350 °F). Line a 33 x 23 cm (13 x 9 inch) rectangular pan with parchment loosely over two sides for easy cake lift. Butter other two sides well."
- "2. Blend flour, baking powder, salt. Important: sift or whisk well to avoid dense spots. Set aside."
- "3. Beat softened butter, canola oil, sugar, and almond extract until creamy and pale, about 3 minutes on medium-high speed. Look for a texture like smooth frosting, not gritty sugar crystals."
- "4. Add eggs one by one, beat thoroughly after each till fully incorporated. Mixture should fluff slightly but not curdle. If it does, lower speed and add a spoonful of flour."
- "5. Alternate folding dry mix and milk, starting and ending with flour. Fold gently using a rubber spatula or low mixer speed. Overmixing tightens gluten, toughening crumb."
- "6. Fold in sour cream last to add moisture and a mild tang. Batter consistency should be thick but spreadable; use spatula to test—it falls slowly, holds shape briefly."
- "7. Scrape batter evenly into prepared pan. Tap pan gently on counter to release air bubbles."
- "8. Bake 65-70 minutes. Don’t rely solely on time. Check surface: even golden brown; edges slightly pulling away from pan; toothpick inserted near center clean or with dry crumbs. If wet batter clings, bake longer. Oven varies; know your oven’s hot spots."
- "9. Cool in pan ~40 minutes on wire rack before lifting cake out by parchment edges. Cool completely before slicing."
- ""
- "=== Filling & Topping ==="
- "10. Whip cream with maple sugar and almond extract till stiff peaks hold shape, not grainy or over-beaten into butter. Keep some aside (about 1 1/2 cups) for decorating details."
- "11. Toss 3 1/2 cups blueberries with lemon zest. This adds brightness, cuts sweetness, prevents flavor monotony."
- "12. Using long serrated knife, slice cake horizontally into two even layers. To avoid tearing, steady cake with one hand as you cut slowly with a sawing motion."
- "13. Spread 2 cups whipped cream evenly over bottom layer. Sprinkle lemon-zested blueberries atop cream for even coverage but not piled high; helps layers stay stable."
- "14. Place second cake layer on top gently; press lightly to secure."
- "15. Frost top and sides with remaining whipped cream, smoothing with an offset spatula for an even surface. Chill if cream softens too much."
- "16. Arrange remaining 1 1⁄2 cups blueberries evenly on top, covering all cream."
- "17. Fit a small star or round tip onto a piping bag filled with reserved stiff cream. Pipe Quebec flag: draw vertical center cross, then horizontal bar crossing it to form a plus sign. Use tight, small rosettes closely placed. Add fleur-de-lis shapes in corners by overlapping small shell or leaf patterns. Keep hands steady; cream must be firm or decorations slump."
- "18. Store refrigerated until ready. Serve within 24 hours for best texture (cream freshness, blueberry juice absorption)."

- "Tips & Troubleshooting"
- "- Substitutes: Use light olive oil if canola missing; flavor shifts slightly but moist crumb maintained. Sour cream can be swapped with full-fat Greek yogurt."
- "- If batter feels too thick after adding sour cream, splash a bit more milk but proceed cautiously to avoid runny batter."
- "- Whipping cream best chilled. Warm cream won't whip properly. Chill bowl and beaters for fastest peaks."
- "- For uneven baking: cover cake loosely with foil mid-bake if top browns faster than center."
- "- Should toothpick test fail late in baking, lower oven temp slightly and extend time. Avoid open door frequently; causes fall."
- "- Parchment edges make cake removal effortless, crucial for layering without breakage."
- "- Lemon zest is optional but cuts sweetness and adds balance to blueberry’s earthy sweetness."
- "- Maple sugar is a local twist replacing confectioner's sugar. Use powdered sugar if unavailable; sweetness slightly different."
- "- If decoration piping softens, refrigerate cake for 10 minutes, re-pipe as needed before serving."
- "- For a crisper crust, bake a minute longer and let cake sit uncovered after removal."
introduction: "Tough cake mornings. Butter vs oil debate. How much sugar to keep that noticeable but not sticky cling? Swapping half butter for canola oil lightens density without sacrificing flavor—moist crumbs that keep well. Almond extract over vanilla—more intriguing, subtle nutty note. Sour cream sneaks in richness and tender crumb, breaks monotony of milk alone. Timing? Don’t trust the clock, smell the aroma, watch the edges curl back, test the toothpick. Blueberries not just slapped on; some zested with lemon to brighten heavy sweetness. Maple sugar for whip cream ties a regional thread—an earthy sweetness, more complex than plain powdered sugar. Layered layers sliced with precision, piped flag done with patience. Texture dabble, taste twist. This cake’s a canvas, not just a dessert."
ingredientsNote: "Flour reduction helps keep cake from over-tightening as heaviness builds with sour cream and oil addition. Combining butter and oil balances flavor and moisture—pure oils alone yield a flat crumb, butter alone can dry out quicker. Baking powder increased slightly to handle added dairy. Almond extract swaps vanilla to freshen profile—vanilla can fade, almond remains distinct. Sour cream’s fat content softens crumb, adds subtle tang—a texture savior. Maple sugar for cream sweetens with a caramel note, less cloying than classic powdered sugar, a nod to Quebec heritage. Fresh blueberries key—choose plump, firm berries. Lemon zest interplay refreshes palate—an often overlooked citrus lift. Using chilled cream bowls and beaters critical for stiff peaks; impure fat or warmth kills whip potential. Always measure liquids and fats accurately, or crumb fails. Parchment strategy: letting it hang over pan edges prevents missing that perfect cake removal moment that ruins presentation."
instructionsNote: "Start with the oven—mid-rack placement ensures even heat distribution. Prepping the pan is crucial; parchment overhang saves cake during unmolding—don’t skip or shortcut with just butter spray or flour dust; that risks sticking and broken edges. Creaming butter/oil/sugar—watch texture, no gritty sugar grains. Add eggs one at a time; rushing can yield curdled batter. Folding dry ingredients alternated with milk prevents gluten overdevelopment—gentle strokes avoid rubbery texture. Sour cream last, folded in to keep batter airy yet creamy. Watch batter viscosity—it should flow slowly off spatula but hold shape. Baking time it approximate—look for crackly golden crust and toothpick test. Cooling must not be rushed; hot cake will crumble when sliced. Whipping cream: stiff peaks by feel are better than timing; overbeating leads to butter formation. Reserve some cream for piping; temperature affects pipeability. Layering: careful horizontal slice with serrated knife, steady hand. Lemon zest blueberries scattered prevents sogginess in cream layer. Final piped flag requires steady wrist, firm cream for detail; chill cake before piping to hold shapes. Store chilled; avoid sogginess by serving within a day."
tips:
- "Parchment helps. Overhang prevents sticking. Do not skip this step or face crumbled layers. Grease must be thorough."
- "Monitor cream whipping. Gather chilled tools; bowls, beaters icy. It matters. Overbeat into butter. Stops when peaks hold."
- "For fluff without weight, incorporate sour cream carefully. Fold in. Don't mix too much or you might tighten the crumb."
- "Use a serrated knife for slicing. Cut layers evenly. Too quick, and you risk tearing; steady hands matter."
- "Oven varies. Familiarize yours. Check cake with toothpick, not just by time. Look for color change, edges pulling."
faq:
- "q: Can I use different oil? a: Sure; light olive oil works, though it shifts flavor slightly. Keep balance in mind."
- "q: Too thick batter? a: Add milk cautiously. Not loosely, too runny. Avoid drastic changes. Testing consistency is key."
- "q: Issues with whipping cream? a: Warm cream won’t whip. Chill first. Use cold tools for best results. Warmth ruins."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate tightly. Or freeze for later. But freshness fades. Best within a day."
