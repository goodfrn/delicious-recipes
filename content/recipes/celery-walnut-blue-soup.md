ingredients:
- "1 small white leek, finely chopped"
- "2 tbsp avocado oil or olive oil"
- "8 celery stalks, roughly chopped"
- "1 medium apple, peeled cored and diced"
- "60 ml dry vermouth or low sodium vegetable broth"
- "1 liter (4 cups) chicken or vegetable broth"
- "50 g (1/4 cup) Arborio rice or short grain risotto rice"
- "40 g (1 1/2 cups) fresh spinach leaves, stemmed"
- "100 ml creme fraiche or 18% cooking cream"
- "30 g creamy blue cheese, crumbled (Gorgonzola or Roquefort)"
- "30 g toasted walnuts, chopped finely"
- "Salt and white pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Heat oil in a medium saucepan over moderate heat. Toss in leek. Stir gently, letting it soften and shed a mild onion sweetness, 3 minutes. Watch carefully — don’t let it brown or bitter notes emerge."
- "Add celery and apple pieces. Stir to coat in oils. Pour in vermouth, scraping bottom briefly to lift fond; liquid should reduce rapidly, evaporating alcohol but retaining essence, about 2 minutes. Nose should brighten with herbal notes and tart apple aroma."
- "Pour in broth and Arbiro rice. Bring to a gentle simmer. Cover partially. Cook until rice swells and tender enough to break apart under gentle pressure but not mushy, roughly 20 minutes. Swirl occasionally to prevent sticking; expect broth to thicken noticeably."
- "When celery and rice feel soft under the tip of a spoon, toss in spinach. Stir and cover. Spinach should wilt quickly; vibrant green turns dull yet fresh, about 4-5 minutes."
- "Using a blender (immersion or countertop), process mixture to silky smooth. Watch viscosity — should hold shape delicately on spoon, but without pasty thickness."
- "Return puree to pan on low heat. Stir in creme fraiche slowly, stirring just till incorporated. Heat gently — no boil — to keep cream from breaking and to marry flavors."
- "Adjust seasoning. Salt builds the base flavor; white pepper is preferable here for gentle heat that blends invisibly."
- "Ladle soup into warmed bowls. Top each with crumbled blue cheese and toasted walnuts. The contrast of creamy, tangy cheese with crisp nut bits adds texture and punch. Serve immediately to preserve crunchy topping."
introduction: "Start with mirepoix’s quieter cousin — leek. Its delicate layers call for gentle heat. No rushing here; coax out nuanced sweetness without bitterness. Add celery for that stringy crunch softened by cooking — fibrous yet yielding once broken down. Apple? Not just sweet filler. Its tart acidity cuts through the creaminess. Vermouth instead of wine injects a subtle herbaceous backbone; vegetable broth stands if you want lighter savor. Arborio rice tricks texture sense — swells up creamy, a natural thickener with slight bite left inside. Spinach thrown late keeps its body, color. Blend smooth but eye the body. Creme fraiche, richer and less tangy than sour cream, just enough fat to balance. Blue cheese — optional but sharp edge. Walnuts toasted then chopped fine — crunch, earthiness, a heady nutty flick. No eggs, no gluten, high flavor punch. A soup that relies on layers built patiently, smell guiding when to move on. That sizzle, that hiss of simmer. Know these moments, the kitchen telling you when you’re on track."
ingredientsNote: "Don’t skimp on the quality of blue cheese or walnuts — crumbled versus melted changes mouthfeel drastically. If you prefer vegan or dairy-free, swap creme fraiche for coconut cream and omit cheese. Celery, try trimming off tough strings using a vegetable peeler before chop for a silkier mouthfeel if you dislike fibrous bits. Leek washing crucial; grit hidden in layered folds can ruin texture and mouthfeel. Arborio preferred to long grain; it breaks down partially releasing starch, thickening broth naturally. Dry vermouth is a subtle flavor enhancer, but chicken or mushroom broth works well for firm savory base. Olive oil is classic, avocado oil lends a neutral taste with a higher smoke point if needed. Spinach fresh is best; frozen or canned watery, adding unwanted dilution."
instructionsNote: "Start leeks over moderate heat; too high and bitter compounds develop quickly. Softening first is crucial — you want them translucent but just barely colored. When adding apple and celery, coat in oil fully before liquid, prevents sticking and uneven cooking. Deglaze with vermouth (or broth) as a quick step to dissolve any caramelized bits stuck on pan base — that’s flavor gold. Simmer broth with rice until rice al dente yet tender; test with fork to avoid gummy soup. Spinach last — its delicate leafy structure demands only minutes to wilt, preserving nutrients and color. Blending hot contents requires caution — fill blender halfway, vent lid or cover with towel to avoid splatter. Creme fraiche stirred in off heat preserves texture and prevents splitting. Season at end; salt amplifies flavor but overdoing kills subtlety. Use white pepper to keep appearance pale and taste balanced. Cooling samples can quickly reveal if seasoning is flat or harsh. Garnish last minute, promptly serving to keep walnuts crunch and cheese tang fresh."
tips:
- "Start with leeks; cook gently, don’t brown. Adjust heat to coax out sweetness. Celery will add necessary crunch. Tip: peel tough celery strings for a better mouthfeel."
- "Add apple and celery; coat fully in oil. Helps with even cooking, prevents sticking. Key step. Deglaze with vermouth, lifts that flavor. Or use broth; just as good."
- "Broth simmering? Rice needs about 20 mins. Test regularly, don’t go mushy. Check that creamy swirl. Swirl, don’t stir too harshly, keeps it from sticking."
- "Spinach in at the end. Cook just until wilted. Too long? You lose color and nutrients. Quick stir is best. Immediate flavors from fresh greens."
- "Blending? Watch out. Fill blender halfway; avoid splatter. Always vent the lid. Unsupported foam will erupt. Adjust consistency by eye; keep it balanced."
- "When adding creme fraiche, do it off heat. Keeps texture intact. No curdling here. Right at the end, adjust seasoning. Use white pepper; lifts flavor without color changes."
faq:
- "q: What substitute for chicken broth? a: Vegetable broth works; it's lighter. Use mushroom broth for deeper flavor. Chicken broth is fuller; adjust seasoning accordingly."
- "q: Can I use a different type of rice? a: Arborio creates creamy texture. Short grain rice works too. Avoid long grain; it won't thicken the broth right."
- "q: How to store leftover soup? a: Refrigerate in an airtight container. Use within 3 days. Or freeze for later. But blend again after thawing; adjust texture."
- "q: Is there a vegan option? a: Sure! Omit blue cheese, switch creme fraiche for coconut cream. Richness intact. Use vegetable broth; flavors still solid."
