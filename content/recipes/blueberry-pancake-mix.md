ingredients:
- "1 liter (4 cups) all purpose flour unbleached"
- "500 ml (2 cups) almond flour"
- "300 ml (1 ¼ cups) dried cranberries"
- "150 ml (⅔ cup) coconut sugar"
- "20 ml (1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon) cream of tartar"
- "8 ml (1 ½ teaspoons) baking soda"
- "1,5 ml (¼ teaspoon) fine sea salt"
instructions:
- "Dump almond flour first in large bowl, sift flour over it to avoid clumps;"
- "Stir dry powders together, cream of tartar and baking soda, ensure even distribution for lift."
- "Add salt, then dried cranberries; stir gently so berries don’t break up too much and ink butter smell into mix."
- "Combine sugars thoroughly with dry blend before storage to prevent pockets of sweetness."
- "Seal in airtight jar or container, store in cool dry place."
- "To use, slowly whisk 1 cup (250 ml) dry mix with 1 cup plant milk or water until just combined; batter lumpy but not floury."
- "Heat skillet medium; must sizzle drop of water instantly but not singe."
- "Ladle ¼ cup batter, cook till bubbles pop on surface, edges dry, around 1 min, flip quick, another 1 min till golden brown spots appear."
introduction: "Dry pancake base with dried berries, not your typical flour and sugar. Almond flour inclusion cuts starchy chew, adds subtle nuttiness without nuts or lactose, easy on digestion too. Coconut sugar replaces white; less processed and holds moisture. Acid-base mix switched from baking powder to cream of tartar plus baking soda; fresher rise, tang hint. Uses dried cranberries over blueberries — punchier flavor, less mush. Mix to store, use when hungry. Hydrate on demand avoids lumping, controls batter texture. Watch bubbles, edges crisping—look for that telltale flick flip sound—pancakes that cook through yet stay moist inside. Keeps vegan, nut allergy swaps by subbing oat flour if needed. Season salt down to highlight berry tartness without overwhelming batter. No eggs, no milk, but rises. Kitchen-tested and ready."
ingredientsNote: "All-purpose flour forms backbone but almond flour cuts heaviness, lifts texture with protein and fats, crisp edges, tender crumb. Almond flour fresh, not rancid. Coconut sugar for subtle caramel notes plus moisture retention, not too sweet; brown sugar works if unavailable. Cranberries in place of blueberries — no gummy blue residue, intensifies tart bite balanced by sugar and salt. Cream of tartar pairs with soda for clean rise, stabilizes pancake shape; baking powder is shortcut but flavor less pure. Salt crucial; enhances flavors, balances sweetness, so reduce from classic recipes to let fruit sing. Keep dry mix in airtight container away from moisture to prevent caking and spoilage. Shake before use to redistribute any settled dried fruit or powder."
instructionsNote: "Use clean mixing bowl dry and big. Add almond flour first, then sift all purpose to avoid lumps and ensure even mix with leaveners — critical for uniform rise. Cream of tartar and soda together more reliable than powder for consistent bubbles. Stir cranberries gently to prevent bleeding pigment stain or crushing which can create spots in pancakes. Store dry mix in a container that seals well; moisture ruins texture fast. When hydrating, slow whisking prevents tough gluten activation. Batter should stay slightly lumpy, overmixing leads to dense cakes. Medium heat for skillet is crucial; test with water droplets—the sound is your guide. Flip only once bubbles burst and edges dry; flipping prematurely breaks structure. Cook until golden, check bottom color by lifting edge, color deep amber, not pale or burnt. Let pancakes rest on wire rack briefly before serving to keep crust crisp; stacking traps steam, softening edges unwantedly."
tips:
- "Start with almond flour first. Avoids lumping when you sift the flour. Ensures even distribution of leaveners. Don’t rush this process."
- "Store mix airtight. Moisture ruins dry mixtures fast. Glass jars are great. Also check for any settled ingredients. Shake thoroughly."
- "For the batter: use plant milk or water. Add slowly. Lumps okay, but floury isn’t good. Overmixing toughens texture. Less is more."
- "Skillet temp crucial. Too hot burns, too low undercooks. Drops of water should sizzle. Listen for sounds of cooking; indicators are key."
- "Let pancakes rest on wire rack. Prevents steam trapping. Stacking makes edges soft. Not what you want; some crunch adds value."
faq:
- "q: How long can I store the pancake mix? a: Store airtight for weeks. Check for clumps. Moisture is the enemy. Toss if unsure."
- "q: Can I use different berries? a: Sure. Sub dried blueberries or even cherries sometimes. Fresh fruits can make batter too wet."
- "q: What if pancakes stick to the pan? a: Might need more heat or oil. Also, test surface with water. Sizzling means ready."
- "q: Can I freeze the batter? a: Not recommended. It changes texture. Better prep in small batches for best results when cooking."
