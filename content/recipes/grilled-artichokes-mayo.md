slug: "grilled-artichokes-mayo"
description: "Charred artichokes grilled in foil packets, enlivened with a tangy homemade avocado mayonnaise, spiked with smoked paprika. This version swaps sunflower oil for light olive oil for richer mouthfeel. Mayo uses lemon juice instead of cider vinegar for fresher notes. Artichokes trimmed with scissors to prevent thorns, grilled till tender, then blast grilled to crisp edges. The mayo emulsifies by slow oil drizzle; texture critical. Cook by sight and touch not clock. No rush. Foil packs steam, grilling finishes with smoky char marks. Smoked paprika adds earthy warmth, avocado oil gives silkiness. Salt and pepper essential—don't skimp. Patience, attention, and key tweaks for smoky, creamy bites."

ingredients:
- "=== Avocado Mayonnaise ==="
- "1 egg yolk"
- "12 ml lemon juice"
- "12 ml Dijon mustard"
- "140 ml light olive oil"
- "1 tsp smoked paprika"
- "=== Artichokes ==="
- "4 medium artichokes"
- "80 ml light olive oil"
instructions:
- "=== Prep Mayonnaise ==="
- "Start whisking egg yolk, lemon juice, and mustard in a bowl. No rush. Drizzle oil slowly, drop by drop at first, whisk hard. Watch mayo thicken; texture matters. When creamy, drizzle remaining oil steadily, never stop whisking. Fold in smoked paprika for earthy hit. Salt and pepper last. Chill till serving. Don't skip chilling; flavors meld while mayo firms."
- "=== Artichoke Prep ==="
- "Trim base stem flush with knife. Cut sharp leaf tips off with scissors to avoid pokes. Good handling pays here. Coat each artichoke in olive oil, salt, pepper. Wrap tight in heavy-duty foil packet. Seal completely or steam leaks; artichokes steam inside pack until tender. Any oil can be substituted with mild grapeseed but light olive adds flavor. Salt earlier for even seasoning."
- "=== Grilling Artichokes ==="
- "Preheat grill high. Zone with hotter and cooler spots. Place foil packs on hot side. Grill 25 minutes total, turning once halfway, listening for soft hissing steam escape from vents. After 25 minutes, carefully unwrap (steam burn risk). Toss artichokes directly on grill surface. Turn often to char all sides for 5-8 minutes till blackened spots pop. Leaves should open like petals when gently pulled. Done when base pierces with knife easily. Texture: tender but still has bite; no mush."
- "=== Serve ==="
- "Place grilled artichokes on platter. Drizzle or serve mayo on side. Guests pull leaves, dip in mayo to taste. Leftover mayo keeps 2 days refrigerated. Artichokes best eaten warm but room temp fine. Can't find fresh artichokes? Substitute with canned, rinse well, pat dry, char briefly for smoky vibe but loses fresh bite."
- "=== Tips & Troubleshooting ==="
- "If mayo breaks, whisk in a bit boiling water or another egg yolk then re-emulsify. If artichokes resist softening, add 10 minutes steam in foil before grilling. Watch grill heat—too low means dry leaves, too high burns. Scissor trimming safer than knife when prepping artichokes. Mayonnaise oil can be sunflower, but olive or avocado oils offer richer texture and flavor. Rest mayo chilled for best taste and texture."
introduction: "The artichoke is not a quick fix. Its leaves need coaxing to tenderness—not mush but tender, with a slight bite that hints at raw crunch underneath smoky char. Wrapping in foil traps steam, hastens cooking. No direct fire yet – that comes after. Then, a final blistering on hot grill, all sides kissed with blackened marks that scream flavor. Artichoke leaves must open like a flower, almost theatrically. Easy to deny these steps, but the payoff is in holds: a smoky smoke, tangy cream from a homemade mayo that requires a slow hand and patience. Whisk egg yolk, Dijon, and lemon quietly. Oil drizzled slow, not rushed—that's your texture, your mouthfeel. Smoked paprika gives a warm, earthy pull that pulls everything together. No cider vinegar here—lemon juice brings clarity and zip. The oil switch to light olive brings richness over neutral sunflower but maintains lightness. Serve hot off the grill or at room temperature, letting guests pull leaves away from base petals and dip into creamy sauce, savor smoky edges. No shortcuts with trimming; snip sharp points for safety and final texture. This method shows why attention beats speed every time, flavor builds layer by layer, bit by bit."
ingredientsNote: "Artichokes ideally fresh and firm. Trim off thorny tips with scissors for easier eating and safer handling; knife cuts risk jagged edges. Olive oil light or avocado oil preferred for mayo to add richness without overpowering. Mustard binds the mayo; Dijon sharp enough to hold emulsification. Lemon juice brightens mayonnaise better than vinegar—softer acidity, fresher lift. Smoked paprika adds smoky depth without overpowering. If no smoked paprika, add a pinch of chipotle or cumin for warmth. Oil quantity adjusted slightly up for stable emulsion and creamier mouthfeel. Salt and pepper essential for seasoning both artichokes and mayo—don’t skimp. If egg yolks unavailable, use pasteurized substitute or a vegan mayo base but flavor and texture will shift. Foil wrap must be tight enough to seal steam but not bursting. Heavy-duty preferable to avoid tears; foil puncture causes dry artichokes."
instructionsNote: "Mayo preparation demands patience—oil in slow, steady streams while whisking vigorously. This prevents breakage and ensures a silky, thick texture. Watch for the mayonnaise to ‘nappe’ the whisk—that’s the first sign it’s thickened enough to add oil faster. Lemon juice swapped for cider vinegar softens tartness and keeps mayo fresh-tasting. For artichokes, trim carefully with scissors to avoid scratch injuries common in kitchens. The foil pack acts as steam chamber; seal it tight or risk drying out artichokes. Grill on high heat induces caramelization and smoky notes after steaming tenderizes leaves inside pack. Remove foil gently to prevent burns from steam burst. Final direct grilling opens leaves and crisps tips—look for deep brown-black speckles, not full black char, to avoid bitterness. Leaves should yield easily when pulled but not fall apart. Mayo spices added at the end prevent flavor dulling during refrigeration. Chill mayo before serving to thicken further and meld flavors. Failure to chill leads to loose mayo prone to separation. Rest mayo at least 15 minutes after emulsifying. Grill marks and aromas are key doneness indicators; no rough timing needed but watch closely. If mayo breaks, whisk in boiling water slowly or start over, never add oil too fast."
tips:
- "Use heavy-duty foil. Must seal air tight. If you don’t, steam escapes, artichokes won't cook right. Consistency key. Don't rush this part."
- "Trim artichokes with scissors, safer than knife. Avoid sharp ends. Be careful though, sharp tips might poke. Better to be safe. Scissors offer control."
- "Watch grill heat. Too high means burned but dry leaves. Too low, you lose char. You want that smoky, crispy edge. Listen for the sizzle."
- "Mayo should be cold before serving. Resting blends flavors well. Don't skip chilling; that's how it thickens. Helps it hold up on the side."
- "If mayo breaks, boiling water helps. Whisk in just a little. Or use another yolk. Slow drizzle matters. Oil must pour steady, not fast."
faq:
- "q: How do I fix broken mayo? a: Add boiling water slowly while whisking hard. If bad, redo. Always drizzle oil in slow until thick. Keep whisking."
- "q: What if artichokes are tough? a: Steam longer in foil, maybe 10 minutes. Then grill. Get those leaves soft before cranking the heat."
- "q: Can I store leftovers? a: Mayo keeps max 2 days in fridge. Use airtight container. Reheat artichokes gently in foil; don’t dry out."
- "q: What oil can I use? a: Light olive preferred. But if out, go for grapeseed or sunflower. Just avoid strong oils that overtake flavor."
