ingredients:
- "500 g parsnips, sliced into rounds"
- "480 g farfalle or any short pasta"
- "70 g unsalted butter"
- "50 g all-purpose flour"
- "1 litre chicken stock"
- "650 g cooked shredded chicken"
- "200 g frozen green beans, thawed"
- "5 ml fresh thyme, chopped"
- "3 ml lemon zest"
- "salt and pepper to taste"
instructions:
- " Heat salted water to boil. Into it, dump parsnips and pasta. Cook both until pasta almost tender - about 10-12 minutes. Drain."
- " Melt butter on medium heat in deep pan. Sprinkle flour, stir quickly, cook roux for 2 minutes to get rid of raw taste."
- " Pour half the chicken stock (500 ml) in slowly. Whisk continuously to avoid lumps. Add remaining broth, bring to bubble."
- " Toss in shredded chicken, green beans, thyme leaves, and lemon zest. Let simmer gently for 3 minutes."
- " Return drained pasta and parsnips back into sauce. Stir. Season with salt and pepper. Adjust thickness with more broth if needed."
- " Serve hot, or hold on low heat for a few minutes."
introduction: "Pasta and root vegetables. Nothing fancy but still needs attention. Parsnips swap carrots for different sweetness and texture. Farfalle holds sauce well - little butterfly shapes trap every bit. Roux is quick, butter and flour mingling to thicken up bitter stock flavors. Chicken beats the plain broth, bringing meaty bits. Green beans step in for peas - crunchier, a bit less sweet. Fresh thyme breaks monotony with earthiness. Lemon zest pops brightness, unexpected but needed. Not smooth, not layered in cream but nicely thick and rustic. No eggs, no nuts, no lactose. Fast cook, simple dinner. Mix, stir, serve. Get messy or chilled leftovers the same day."
ingredientsNote: "Parsnips instead of carrots – a sweeter, earthier root. Frozen green beans instead of peas – extra snap after simmering, less mush. Butter and flour ratio slightly adjusted; thicker roux for better hold of sauce. Fresh thyme over estragon for a different aromatic twist. Lemon zest adds a citrus edge that contrasts richness. Farfalle chosen for its shape, but any short kind will do. Stock preferably homemade or low sodium for control. Chicken shredded – leftovers or store-bought. Salt and pepper to taste - start low and build. No nuts, no dairy aside from butter, no eggs anywhere in this dish."
instructionsNote: "Cook parsnips and pasta together to save time; parsnips need about as much cooking as pasta. Drain well but keep some cooking water as backup. Roux takes 2 full minutes to cook the raw flour taste off, must whisk constantly. Add broth gradually, whisk on medium heat; patience avoids lumps and grainy sauce. Simmer shredded chicken and beans just long enough - 3 minutes to warm through but keep green beans texture. Add pasta and parsnips to sauced pan last - coat everything evenly. Adjust seasoning after mixing. Add lemon zest right before serving for best aroma. Serve immediately or low heat hold for up to 10 minutes, otherwise sauce thickens too much."
tips:
- "Cook parsnips sliced thin. They need less time than you think. Start with water boiling. Don't forget to season well. This makes a difference."
- "Roux is crucial. Use medium heat. Whisk constantly. This keeps lumps away. The texture is key. Too thick or too thin is not good."
- "Simmer chicken and beans just 3 minutes. Warming is enough. Overcooking makes them mushy. That crunch is what you want."
- "Taste and adjust seasoning after mixing everything. It's easy to under-season. Try adding more lemon zest for a fresh kick. It brightens the dish."
- "For leftovers, store in airtight container. Reheat gently. Add a splash of water if needed. Keep the sauce creamy when you warm it."
faq:
- "q: What's the best way to cut parsnips? a: Thin, even rounds work best. Size matters for cooking time. Aim for uniformity. They cook evenly that way."
- "q: Can I use something else instead of green beans? a: Yes, asparagus or broccoli could fit. Just watch the cooking time. Don't overcook vegetables."
- "q: How do I prevent the sauce from becoming too thick? a: Adding more chicken stock helps. Gradually pour. Stir well. This ensures fluidity."
- "q: What's the best way to store this dish? a: Keep it in fridge. Use an airtight container. It lasts about 3-4 days. Reheat slowly to avoid drying."
