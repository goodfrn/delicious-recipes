instructions:
- "=== Pork marinade and roasting ==="
- "Set oven rack to center, preheat to 210°C (410°F)."
- "In blender, puree coriander, jalapeño, garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper."
- "Reserve 90 ml of this marinade in a small bowl for serving."
- "Place pork roast in glass baking dish. Season with salt and pepper. Coat with remaining marinade."
- "Roast 40-50 minutes until internal temp hits 56-58°C (133-136°F). Remove, cover loosely with foil, rest 15 minutes. Carryover heat raises temp to about 62°C (144°F)."
- "=== Chutney ==="
- "Meanwhile, combine onion, pineapple, tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, water, and agave syrup in saucepan."
- "Bring to boil stirring often. Simmer medium-low 35 minutes until syrupy. Season with salt and pepper."
- "Cool, cover, refrigerate until serving. Lasts 2 weeks chilled in airtight container."
- "=== Assembly ==="
- "Slice pork thin. Drizzle pan juices over slices."
- "Spread mustard on warm grilled brioche slices."
- "Layer pork on bread, spoon pineapple chutney over pork."
- "Top with arugula. Drizzle reserved marinade over all."
introduction: "Chunks of pineapple simmer down in a sharp tangy chutney sweetened lightly with agave rather than syrup. The roasting pork loin, rub coated with a punchy cilantro jalapeño marinade, cooks slowly to pink, resting about 15 minutes to stay juicy. Thick brioche slices get dressed in grainy mustard then layered with sliced pork, pineapple chutney. Peppery arugula pushed on top, a drizzle of extra marinade brightens. Balsamic vinegar switched into the chutney for richer flavor, changing timing slightly to get that sticky texture. Steps are streamlined but timings altered by several minutes each step. Cool chutney beforehand. Final dish assembled quickly at serving, finger food style or plated up. Sharp, sweet, savory, spicy."
ingredientsNote: "Cilantro can be replaced with fresh parsley or mint for different herb notes. Jalapeño seeds left or removed changes heat level—adjust as preferred. Agave syrup replaces maple syrup here, a milder sweetness, with balsamic vinegar swapped in for rice vinegar to deepen the chutney flavor. The chutney thickens with slow simmering; keep the heat moderate to avoid burning. Pineapple pieces should be small and fresh for best texture. Pork loin about 1kg is ideal; trimmed and unrolled. Keep marinade reserved before coating pork for drizzling at service. Brioche slices best grilled just before plating for texture contrast with chutney and meat."
instructionsNote: "Puree the marinade ingredients thoroughly for a smooth but not watery liquid. Allow the pork to marinate briefly as you preheat oven. When roasting, use an instant-read thermometer to avoid overcooking; aim for medium doneness. Rest the pork tented in foil to seal juices—this temp rise is crucial. Meanwhile, chutney needs frequent stirring during simmer to avoid sticking or burning. Simmer time tweaked to about 35 minutes until thick but not dry. Chill chutney to develop flavors further. Before serving, slice pork against the grain for tenderness. Spread mustard thickly to contrast sweet chutney and accompany the peppery arugula. Drizzle reserved marinade for brightness and extra punch on the finished tartines."
tips:
- "Use fresh pineapple for chutney. Don’t cut too large. Small chunks mix better. Cook chutney low heat. Stir often to avoid burnt bits. Ideal is syrupy texture, not too dry or watery. Test for seasoning. Tweak salt or sweet to balance flavors."
- "Marinade prep is key. Blend jalapeño, coriander well. Ensure smooth blend for even coat. Reserve part of marinade before applying. This adds depth when drizzled later. Pork needs rest after roasting. It helps juices redistribute. Cover with foil loosely during rest."
- "Grill brioche right before serving. Texture contrast is needed. Warm bread absorbs chutney flavors well. Spread mustard thickly. It offsets sweetness from chutney. Pound for flavor punch. Aim for balance on every bite. Use peppery arugula atop. Fresh greens are a must."
- "Serve quickly after assembly. It’s finger food style. But plates work too. Drizzle reserved marinade on top. Brightens the presentation. Adjust jalapeño heat level. Seeds can be removed for less spice. Marinate pork briefly. Aim for juicy, medium doneness."
- "Keep chutney airtight to last. Two weeks max in fridge. Alternatives for herbs include parsley, mint. Adjust to taste. Avoid letting chutney dry out. Monitor as it cooks. Thin sliced pork ensures tenderness. Cut against grain to help with bite."
faq:
- "q: How to make chutney thicker a: Cook longer. Stir often for consistency. Avoid high heat—burning happens easily. Right texture is key. Too thick needs water adjustment. Tweak seasoning—salt and sweet balance."
- "q: What if pork overcooks? a: Pull earlier to avoid drying. Use thermometer for accuracy—key for doneness. Resting helps retain juices, but if already dry, moisture additions can assist. Sauce helps too."
- "q: Can I switch the meat? a: Yes, chicken or beef can work. Adjust cooking times though. Chicken needs to reach 75°C. Beef for medium should be around 60°C. Taste changes based on the cut."
- "q: Chutney storage options? a: Airtight in fridge for two weeks—best flavor preservation. Consider freezing for longer storage. Thaw before use. Tweak recipe for larger batches too. Adjust ingredients, but keep core same."
