ingredients:
- "2 liters (8 cups) Russet potatoes peeled and cubed (6-7 medium sized)"
- "6 large garlic cloves unpeeled"
- "140 ml (about 2/3 stick) goose fat softened at room temperature"
- "300 ml (1⅓ cups) homemade vegetable broth, warm"
- "Pinch of sea salt"
- "Freshly ground white pepper"
instructions:
- "Put potatoes and garlic cloves in a large pot; cover with cold water by 1 inch."
- "Bring to vigorous boil; reduce to simmer. Check potatoes after 25 minutes by piercing with fork; should slide in easily without falling apart."
- "Drain potatoes and garlic well; shake pot gently to remove excess water. Return to warm burner for a minute to steam off residual moisture."
- "Squeeze garlic cloves from skins directly into potatoes, discard skins. Mash immediately using a sturdy potato masher or ricer for a better texture."
- "Fold in softened goose fat thoroughly, it melts into warm potatoes transforming texture and adding richness. Mix in warm vegetable broth slowly until reaching fluffy, creamy consistency but not watery."
- "Season carefully with salt and white pepper—taste as you go, remembering broth may already have seasoning."
- "Serve promptly as side to roast turkey or root vegetables. The purée thickens slightly as it cools; rewarm gently if needed."
- "Storage tip: Store covered in fridge up to 3 days. Reheat in a pan with small splash broth to bring back silkiness."
introduction: "Peeling and chopping potatoes is straightforward but key is timing water-to-potato ratio and boil control—avoid its rough stir and break during cooking. Garlic simmered whole softens without harsh bite, releasing subtle sweetness. Goose fat instead of duck fat brings different mouthfeel and slightly gamier note, a twist for those who want more depth. Vegetable broth as liquid—not chicken. Good if dairy-free and vegan guests in rotation. Watch textures carefully: proper steaming-off of moisture means assemblage without gluey results. Long cooks alter starch; don’t overcook or mash turns gluey mess. Push through ricer or masher gently to keep air; whipping turns starchy and sticky. Less is more with fat and liquid, slow addition. Flavor balance with salt crucial as broth adds sodium. Serve with roast poultry or hearty winter roots. Carry on, watch aromas and textures; these signal doneness better than clocks."
ingredientsNote: "Russets chosen for high starch content giving fluffy mash. Yukon Golds too waxy, won’t fluff well. Garlic unpeeled during boil reduces risk of bitter overcooking; squeeze softened garlic pulp afterward. Goose fat acts similarly to duck fat but has richer, deeper flavor; substitute with olive oil if perishability or accessibility an issue—know it’ll taste different. Warm vegetable broth replaces chicken stock to keep recipe vegan and allergen-friendly; if homemade broth unavailable, use good quality bouillon cubes gluten-free dissolved in boiling water. Avoid milk or butter here to keep dairy-free—fat from goose provides mouthfeel and flavor. Adjust broth volume to desired consistency; some potatoes absorb more liquid. Freshly ground white pepper less harsh than black—complements delicate garlic notes. For nut allergies, verify broth ingredients."
instructionsNote: "Starting in cold water ensures even cooking without tough centers. Boil vigorously then reduce prevents potato falling apart too soon. Check with fork; soft but intact means starch still stable, no waterlogging. Drain well and return to hot burner briefly to evaporate excess moisture—a common cause of watery purée. Timing and feel best judge doneness, not just minutes. Squeeze garlic directly into pot for easy flavor integration without additional processing steps. Mashing should be firm but gentle—overworking causes gluey, pasty texture due to release of excess starch. Incorporate softened fat gradually, mixing thoroughly for even coating and rich mouthfeel. Warm broth added in steps controls moisture—slow integration prevents last-minute sogginess or dryness. Taste throughout seasoning stage—potatoes mute salt, but broth adds complexity. Serve warm; cool purée thickens and firm, easy to adjust with splash of broth. Rewarming low and slow restores texture without breaking apart. Practical tip: Use ricer for fine texture, masher for rustic feel. Avoid electric mixer—it aerates too much and makes gluey outcome."
tips:
- "Start with cold water. Helps cook evenly; avoid tough centers. Boil vigorously, reduce heat. Less risk of potatoes falling apart. Timing—key here."
- "Garlic goes unpeeled into the pot. Softens without bitterness. Squeeze into potatoes later. Reduces risk of harsh flavor. Mix well for even taste distribution."
- "Don't skip the steaming-off step after draining. Watery purée? Not ideal. Post-drain on warm burner briefly—evaporate residual moisture. Texture matters."
- "Use ricer for fine texture; masher for rustic feel. Avoid electric mixer. Too much air; gluey outcome. Gentle mashing maintains fluffiness. Critical to take care here."
- "Incorporate warm broth slowly. Adjust as needed for consistency—every potato absorbs differently. Taste frequently. Salt balances flavors. Broth can already have sodium."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid gluey mash? a: Key is in mashing technique. Don't overwork potatoes. Gentle pressure while mashing or ricing keeps air in texture."
- "q: Can I substitute goose fat? a: Yes, olive oil works too. Different taste though. Duck fat's similar if available. Adjust based on personal preference."
- "q: What's the best way to store leftovers? a: Store in fridge but, cover tightly. Up to three days. Reheat gently with splash of broth to revive texture."
- "q: Any tips for a creamier purée? a: Use high-starch potatoes like Russets. Steaming off moisture—critical. Slow broth integration, taste as you go."
