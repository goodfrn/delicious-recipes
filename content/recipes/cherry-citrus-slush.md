ingredients:
- "240 g (2 1/3 cups) frozen cherries"
- "150 g (3/4 cup) sugar"
- "600 ml (2 1/2 cups) water"
- "130 ml (1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) orange juice"
- "25 ml (2 tablespoons) lavender syrup"
- "500 ml (2 cups) lemon sorbet"
instructions:
- "1. In a small pot, bring cherries, sugar, and 200 ml (3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons) water to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 7 minutes. Tiny bubbles, fruit softening."
- "2. Place a fine mesh sieve over a bowl. Press cherries with a ladle back and forth to extract juices. Discard pulp or compost."
- "3. Add remaining 400 ml (1 2/3 cups) water, orange juice, and lavender syrup to the strained juice. Cover and chill until nearly cold, about 1 hour and 5 minutes."
- "4. Pour chilled mixture into an ice cream maker. Churn approximately 25 minutes or per machine instructions until slushy consistency."
- "5. Spoon slush into glasses. Add a scoop of lemon sorbet on top. Serve right away with a straw and spoon."
introduction: "Fruit so cold, slushy and thick. Sharp cherries, not too sweet. Orange peeks around edges. Lavender hints lurking, subtle. Sorbet lemon, fresh and bright. Not ice cream, sorbet for zing. No nuts, no gluten, no fuss. Easy to make. Chill, churn, done. Spoon tines digging through cold, straw catching sweetness. Summer’s answer. No eggs, no gluten, just fruit and ice. Tang, flow, bite. Refreshing but not watery. Quickly assembled, quickly eaten, fleeting cold in mouth. Sometimes simple shifts—orange for lemon, lavender for calm—change everything. Cherry chill with a twist."
ingredientsNote: "Frozen cherries hold the cold, release juice on heat. Slightly less sugar balances citrus brightness. Orange juice in place of lemon for mellow acidity. Lavender syrup added for floral depth; adjust or skip for subtlety. Using lemon sorbet adds tartness, swap with vanilla ice cream if richer texture preferred. Water amounts split for better infusion and dilution control. Keep ingredients cold for crisp slush. Sugar can be replaced with honey or agave but expect texture and flavor alterations. Pulp can compost or blend into smoothies if waste is a concern. Sorbet texture key, too soft means overrun, too hard will freeze quickly."
instructionsNote: "Start simmer on medium, slow bubbles to soften cherries, extract flavor. Strain carefully, don’t press pulp too hard; bitter notes linger in overpressed pulp. Mix juices with water, orange, and lavender, chill thoroughly - slush requires cold base. Churn time slightly longer than norm, 25 minutes adjusts for syrup thickness. Watch slush texture—too soft and it melts fast, too thick and it defeats slush purpose. Serve immediately after scooping lemon sorbet on top. Cooling time short post-churn, so prep glasses cold. Mixing steps slight reorder to improve juice clarity and flavor merging. Pulp composting removes bitterness, maintains clarity and cleaner citrus bite."
tips:
- "Start with frozen cherries. They keep everything cool. Create a thicker consistency in a slush. Less sugar balances flavors well. Add sweetness with orange juice. Explore adjusting lavender syrup, too. It brings floral notes but can be subtle. If wanting more vibrant flavor, consider more orange juice. Just don’t overpower cherry taste. Chill everything before you begin. Cold ingredients equal better slush. Adjust water as needed based on juice infusion."
- "Simmer cherries slowly and carefully. Don’t rush this step. Extract flavors well without pushing too hard on pulp. Pulp can be bitter if pressed too much. So, just be gentle. Strain carefully. Don’t leave bitter notes in your slush. Mix juices with chilled water. Get the temperature right. Slush needs cold base. Remember to watch churning time. Overchurning creates a different texture."
- "Use a fine mesh sieve to strain. This helps catch pulp effectively. You want it smooth, not gritty. While waiting, prep serving glasses. Chill them for additional effect. This makes the presentation even better. Serve immediately. Slush melts quickly. Don’t let it sit. If there’s any leftover, store carefully. Pour into air-tight containers and freeze. Just know the texture changes."
- "Lemon sorbet is key. Adds zing. Swap in vanilla ice cream if wanting richer texture. It works well, not the same bright notes, though. Lavender syrup is optional. Can skip if desiring simpler flavors. You could tweak with some mint. Freshness level may change. Consider using honey or agave instead of sugar. But expect different results in flavor and texture."
- "Mixing steps helps improve clarity. Don’t just pour everything together without thought. Layer flavors strategically. It makes a difference. Utilize proper chilling time post-churn to keep it thick. Use a ladle wisely. Spoon slush into glasses gently. Top with sorbet for classic presentation. Keep it pretty and appealing when serving. You want those colors to shine."
faq:
- "q: What if my slush isn't thick? a: Check the churn time. Did you overchurn? If too soft, add less water next time. Special adjustments may help. Maybe chill longer before churning."
- "q: Can I use other fruits? a: Absolutely. Consider berries or even tropical fruits. Different flavors bring unique twists. Don’t forget the sugar balance, get it right. Taste as you go."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Use airtight containers. Freeze immediately for best results. Just know texture won't be the same. Slush can become icy. Re-churn if too hard."
- "q: What if I want more sweetness? a: Adjust with added syrup. Honey might work, too. Just remember balance flavors. Over-sweetening can mask the fruit. Keep it fresh."
