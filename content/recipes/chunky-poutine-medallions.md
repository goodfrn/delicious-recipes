description: "Thick-cut potatoes blanched in salted water, fried twice for crunch with tender centers. Cheese curds melt under a quick broil atop rich beef mushroom gravy. Uses Yukon golds swapped for russets, veal stock and rehydrated dried mushrooms added to gravy. Salt soak removes excess starch and firms edges. Oil temp managed for crisp without overbrowning. Broiler delivers gooey cheese but watch closely to avoid separation. A method heavy on recognizing visual cues and feel to nail texture every batch. Handled with kitchen wisdom—no shortcuts for soggy or greasy outcomes."

ingredients:
- "2 1/2 lbs Yukon gold potatoes sliced into 1/3 inch rounds"
- "1 tablespoon kosher salt plus pinch for soaking water"
- "3-4 cups cold water to cover potatoes"
- "2 quarts vegetable oil or peanut oil for frying"
- "1 1/2 cups beef stock substituted with veal stock for depth"
- "1/2 cup rehydrated dried porcini mushrooms finely chopped"
- "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour"
- "3 tablespoons unsalted butter"
- "1/2 cup cold milk"
- "1 1/2 cups fresh white cheese curds"
- "Fresh cracked black pepper"
- "Optional twist: Smoked paprika and parsley for garnish"
instructions:
- "===Potato Prep==="
- "Rinse sliced potatoes under cold water to remove surface starch. Fill large bowl with 3 cups cold water, sprinkle kosher salt and stir to dissolve. Drop potato medallions in, making sure fully submerged. Let soak 20 minutes to firm up. Expect a dull, tactile firmness when pinched signaling readiness. Drain, dry very well with kitchen towels or salad spinner to avoid splatter."
- "===Gravy Basics==="
- "Start melting butter in saucepan medium heat, stir in flour forming roux. Cook 2-3 minutes watching for golden hue but no burn. Gradually whisk in cold milk, then beef stock. Drop finely chopped porcini mushrooms into gravy, simmer 10-12 minutes to thicken and infuse earthy notes. If gravy too thin, add slurry of cornstarch and water. Season with black pepper. No salt yet—stock often salty."
- "===Frying Technique==="
- "Use deep thermometer, bring oil to 320°F not hotter to avoid overly brown thick potato slices. Test with one piece; should bubble steadily without darkening excessively and feel soft when pierced with knife. Fry in small batches 4-5 minutes. Drain on wire rack over baking sheet to preserve crisp edges. Keep in 200°F oven loosely covered to stay warm. Repeat. Double frying optional but one thorough fry at controlled temp locks perfect soft center with a golden crust."
- "===Assembly==="
- "Preheat broiler on high. Arrange fried medallions in oven-proof dish with rims, layer cheese curds thickly and ladle hot gravy evenly over top—don’t drown or curds won’t melt right. Slide under broiler 3 minutes or until bubbling and cheese shows slight browning spots. Watch closely—curds go from perfect melt to rubbery fast."
- "===Final Touches==="
- "Sprinkle smoked paprika for subtle heat, fresh parsley for earth balance. Let sit 2-3 minutes before serving to let cheese set slightly and gravy thicken. Bite into soft potato, chewy cheese, and warm savory gravy mingling. No soggy fries here; hints of umami mushrooms rounds out. Use tongs or fork with confidence—the texture holds under heat."
- "===Troubleshooting==="
- "If potatoes soggy—oil too cool, soak time too short, or insufficient drying pre-fry. Bitter gravy signals roux burned—lower heat. Mushrooms rubbery means overcooked—add after roux forms, then simmer briefly only. Cheese curds separate? Rapid over broil or old curds. Replace with freshly refrigerated curds or mix fresh mozzarella chunks. Avoid overcrowding fryer or temp drops. Keep oil at right temp with accurate thermometer."
introduction: "Potatoes thick enough to taste their starchy core. Not paper-thin chips masquerading as fries. Soak with salt to tighten flesh, draw out starch. Blot completely—water is enemy of hot oil. That hiss and sputter signals moisture leaving, not failure. Oil temp matter—too hot fries dark and tough, too low soggy and greasy. Gravy—more than salty brown sauce. Add mushroom for funk, veal stock for richness. Cheese curds not shredded mozzarella but fresh white lumps that stretch without oiling off. Broil short and watch like a hawk for subtle melt. Fork through layers of gravy pooling on crisp edges. That snap-food mouthfeel. A balance of textures you don’t fight but savor. Watch, listen, feel your way to exact doneness. Kitchen mastery in simple layers."
ingredientsNote: "Use Yukon gold for waxy creamy inside; russets work but prone to shedding starch, need more salt soak and drying. Salt soak isn’t optional—it firms flesh preventing fry fall apart. Oil—peanut or vegetable, neutral with high smoke points. Avoid butter frying—burns and sogginess. Sub basil or thyme in gravy if no porcini; dried shiitake too. Beef stock is backbone, veal stock for country richness, chicken acceptable but thin. Cheese curds fresher the better; if unavailable fresh mozzarella chunks tossed in just before broil is fallback. Milk in gravy temp controls roux smoothness; cold milk stops lumps. Don't skip blanch-dry-fry sequence to avoid greasy end products."
instructionsNote: "Salt soak potatoes minimum 20 minutes until tactile spring. Completely dry—paper towels or spinner, every drop ruins oil temp. Oil temp critical 320-325°F. Lower and fries soak oil, higher and edges burn while inside raw. Batch fry small quantities to keep oil steady. Remove medallions when tender but not collapsible—poke test. Keep fried potatoes warm in 200°F oven but loose covering prevents sogginess. Gravy needs roux cooked 'til just golden to eliminate raw flour taste. Stir in cold milk gradually prevents lumps. Broil assembled dish 3-4 minutes—watch cheese not grease. Under broil is miss, over broil is rubber. Serve immediately for melting contrast, cheese and crispy potato with silky gravy. Season at each stage appropriately but conservatively."
tips:
- "Thick-cut Yukon golds crucial. They hold structure; russets shed starch, tricky. Salt soak firms flesh - aim for at least 20 minutes in salted water. Watch for tactile rigidity when pinched."
- "Drain and dry those medallions. Water’s enemy of hot oil. Remove every drop. Use towels or spinner. Soaking time too short or oil too cool leads to soggy fries."
- "Oil temp is vital. 320-325°F maintains crisp without burnt edges. Test with a medallion. Should bubble steadily, and knife-pierced soft. Batch-fry to keep oil temp constant."
- "Gravy is more than a splash. Take time for the roux, just golden. Cold milk prevents lumps; stir in gradually. Scraps of mushrooms add funk. Don’t overcook mushrooms."
- "Broil cheese but don’t turn away. Just enough time to melt. Slide under and watch closely, bubbling but rubbery curds can happen fast. Timing crucial for texture."
faq:
- "q: Why are my fries soggy? a: Oil too cool, soak too short, or drying insufficient leads here. Check medallions. If they feel soft, they need more soak."
- "q: My gravy tastes bitter. What’s wrong? a: Roux burned likely. Lower heat, watch closely. Add mushrooms only after roux forms; short simmer to avoid rubber."
- "q: Why is cheese separating during broiling? a: Rapid over broil. Old curds can separate too. Use fresh, keep them cold before broiling. Don’t crowd the pan."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Best eaten fresh. For fridge, layer in container; separate potatoes from gravy. Reheat gently, avoid mushy edges."
