ingredients:
- "1 medium butternut squash peeled and cut in 3/4 inch cubes"
- "1 1/4 pounds Brussels sprouts trimmed and halved or quartered"
- "3 tablespoons avocado oil olive oil substitute for higher smoke point"
- "1 teaspoon kosher salt adjust to taste"
- "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"
- "1/4 cup dried tart cherries swap dried cranberries for more tartness"
- "1/3 cup toasted pecans roughly chopped"
- "Zest and juice of 1 blood orange sub with regular orange"
- "1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar"
- "1 teaspoon honey or maple syrup"
- "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard"
- "Pinch of smoked paprika adds subtle depth"
instructions:
- "Heat oven to 460°F convection if possible for crispiness. Crowding kills crisp edges - spill onto two trays if packed tight."
- "Peel butternut squash thick skins trap moisture. Cut into cubes about 3/4 inch so they roast evenly and don’t fall apart. Scoop seeds then dry cubes."
- "Trim Brussels sprouts stems, peel loose leaves, halve small ones, quarter large sprouts. Dry sprouts well to get brown edges."
- "In large mixing bowl toss squash and Brussels sprouts with oil salt pepper until fully coated. No spot dry or oil slick. Spread in single layer on rimmed sheet pans. Use parchment for easier cleanup but don’t crowd."
- "Set timer loosely for 20 minutes but watch for color. Crispy brown underside means turn or flip – smells nuttier, firm but tender. Overcrowding keeps them steaming."
- "Five minutes before done scatter dried cherries onto veggies, roasting them warms and softens them up. Avoid burning dried fruit here urges caution."
- "While roasting, whisk blood orange zest and juice vinegar honey Dijon paprika in bowl. Adjust tang or sweetness by tasting. Dressing should brighten."
- "Remove trays when veggies browned in spots with crisp bits underneath. Note residual heat softens them so roasting slightly less is better than more."
- "Toss roasted veggies with pecans, add extra dried cherries if liked, pour dressing over and toss or serve dressing on side so veggies stay crisp."
- "Serve immediately. Leftovers? Reheat under broiler or toaster oven to avoid sogginess otherwise loses texture."
introduction: "Forget limp, steamed veggies. Raw edges, contrasting bites. Roasting's all about coaxing caramelized bits out at high heat, not just color. Butternut’s sweet cubes balance Brussels sprouts’ natural bitterness. Drying surfaces for crisp edges is key. Toss early with oil and seasoning—flavor coverage throughout. But fruit goes in late; sugar’s delicate under fire. The dressing punches with tang and smoky depth. Pecans add crunch, texture balance. Swap avocado oil for olive if you want higher smoke. Dried tart cherries swap cranberries for brightness. No fluff; just kitchen wisdom for crisp edges and bold, layered flavor."
ingredientsNote: "Peeling butternut is tedious: use a sturdy peeler or sharp knife and cut waste minimal. Pre-cut squash? Roasting times drop. Dry Brussels sprouts well–moisture ruins crispness. Cut similar size chunks for even roasting. Use avocado oil or a robust oil with high smoke point; olive oil can burn and taste off. Pick drier dried fruit and add late to avoid burn. Toast pecans beforehand but avoid overcooking; check freshness before using. Blood orange zest adds more complex flavor but substitute regular orange or lemon zest if necessary."
instructionsNote: "Watch and listen, not just time. Crackling means water leaving and browning starting. Lift pan and shake midway to roast evenly. Flip sprouts to expose crisp side. Smell caramelization, nutty aroma—not burnt. Adding dried fruit 5 minutes left plumps without burning. Whisk dressing ingredients and taste, adjusting acidity and sweetness before adding. Toss veggies gently to avoid mashing. Serve hot or re-crisp leftovers under broiler for texture restoration."
tips:
- "Don’t skip drying Brussels sprouts. Moisture can ruin crispiness. Pat them down before mixing with oil. Cut pieces to similar sizes. Grab a sharp knife."
- "Use avocado oil, it has a higher smoke point. Prevents burning. Olive oil is okay but watch for bitterness. Adjust heat - every oven thinks differently."
- "Look for color! Crispy brown bottoms means turning veggies. Shake or flip them. Timing? Visual cues matter; don’t fixate only on clocks."
- "Add dried fruits late, maybe last 5 minutes. This keeps them plump and vibrant. Stop sugar from hardening. Watch carefully or risk burning."
- "Leftovers? Broiler’s your friend, adds that crunch back. Avoid microwaves; they turn veggies mushy. Just toss them under high heat for a couple of minutes. "
faq:
- "q: How do I keep veggies from steaming? a: Space them! Crowding is death for crisp edges. Use multiple pans if needed. Keep air circulating."
- "q: What if I don’t have blood oranges? a: Regular oranges work fine, even lemons. Adjust flavor slightly though. Don’t let fruit shopping limit creativity."
- "q: Veggies burned. What happened? a: Likely heat too high or overcrowded. Keep an eye on smell - sweet nutty aromas mean caramelization not charring. Check frequently."
- "q: Can I prep veggies ahead of time? a: Yes, but store them dry to avoid moisture buildup. Cutting and peeling in advance saves time but don’t mix oils until ready to roast."
