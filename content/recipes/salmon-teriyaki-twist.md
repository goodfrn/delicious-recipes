ingredients:
- "60 ml  (1/4 cup) tamari sauce, low sodium substitute"
- "45 ml  (3 tbsp) pure maple syrup, swap for honey or agave"
- "60 ml  (1/4 cup) mirin"
- "20 ml  (1 1/3 tbsp) rice vinegar"
- "1  shallot, thinly sliced"
- "3  cloves garlic, minced fine"
- "2.5 ml  (1/2 tsp) chili garlic sauce, or 1/4 tsp chili flakes"
- "4  salmon fillets (about 150 g each), skin on or off"
- "15 ml  (1 tbsp) toasted sesame seeds"
- "15 ml  (1 tbsp) avocado oil - high smoke point"
- "450 g  (1 lb) green beans, trimmed and blanched"
- "10 ml  (2 tsp) fresh ginger julienned"
- "30 g  (1 oz) sliced toasted almonds"
- "Salt and cracked black pepper"
instructions:
- "===Prepare sauce==="
- "Mix tamari, maple syrup, mirin, rice vinegar, shallot, garlic, chili sauce in small saucepan. Bring to brisk boil over medium heat. Stir occasionally. Watch as liquid thickens into syrupy glaze, about 12 minutes. If sauce clumps or burns, reduce heat immediately."
- "===Salmon prep==="
- "Pat fillets dry aggressively. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle sesame seeds evenly on one side only—the seeding side will face down in pan. Sets up crust texture; flipping carefully maintains seeds."
- "===Cook salmon==="
- "Heat avocado oil in heavy skillet over medium-high. Oil should shimmer but not smoke. Place fillets seeded side down—listen for crisp sizzle. Press gently to ensure uniform contact. After 6 minutes, color will turn golden and seeds toast. Flip with wide spatula. Cook another 4–5 minutes. Flesh should be opaque near edges but slightly translucent center; flake test with fork to confirm."
- "===Green beans and almonds==="
- "Toss blanched green beans with toasted almonds, fresh ginger juliennes, pinch of salt. Warm briefly in pan used for salmon to pick up leftover fat and caramelization bits. Toss for 2 minutes until aromatic and tender-crisp."
- "===Assembly==="
- "Divide green beans onto plates. Surf each with salmon. Spoon thick teriyaki glaze liberally over top—should coat, not pool. Garnish with extra ginger julienne—sharp bite cuts through richness."
- "Serve immediately. Sauce clings to salmon with sticky sheen; beans fresh, nutty crunch."
- "Cleanup tip: Deglaze pan with splash water or sake after removing salmon—captures brown bits for richer sauce or side drizzle."
introduction: "Teriyaki salmon, often drowning in syrupy sauce, misses texture. Skip that. Hold seeds on fish, get crispy bite. Sauce simmered slow to thick, syrup consistency—not runny, coats every lip. Swap soy for tamari, less salty, richer umami. Maple syrup dips in subtly, swapping plain sugar for flavor layering. Rice vinegar down from 2 tbsp to just enough sharp punch, balancing sweetness. Mirin still present but don’t overdo. Turn heat up or down by watching sounds, smells. Sizzle soft but consistent on sear; silence means pan needs heat or oil refresh. Green beans blanched to tender crunch, warmed with nutty almonds, fresh ginger—brings energy and texture contrast. Garlic and shallot base aromatic, more punch with chili garlic sauce instead of sambal—less fiery but deep. Salmon skin optional; skin-on retains moistness; skin-off gives clean sear and better seed grip. Always dry fish well. Next: precise timing, texture, flow."
ingredientsNote: "Tamari is your sub if sodium sensitive, less harsh than soy sauce. Maple syrup, not just sweet, adds woody, milky notes that sugar lacks. If in a pinch, honey or light agave can swap but shift flavor profile. Rice vinegar measured down to avoid sharp acid masking sweet or salt. Fresh ginger julienned not pickled ginger here—gives zesty bite versus sweet-sour. Garlic slightly increased, shallot sliced, not minced; gives texture and mild onion sweetness, softens on long simmer. Chili garlic sauce picked to add umami chili, less heat than sambal. Avocado oil replaces olive for higher smoke point—less burnt oil taste, crisp sear. For crunch, almonds toasted separately to avoid sogginess from beans. Salmon sized smaller to promote even cooking; use thick fillets. Green beans blanched until just tender-crisp; no limp veg allowed. Precision here preserves crunch and color. Keep dry before sautéing to avoid splattering or steaming fish."
instructionsNote: "Start sauce first; simmers best alone, builds flavor in low boil, not aggressive. Stir often towards end to prevent burning sugars. Fish skin side can go either way; skin side down helps oil and seeds get crisp, skin-off may lose moisture fast. Flip carefully once seeds visibly toasted—avoid seed loss. Don’t crowd pan or fish steams. Use spatula, not tongs, to keep shape. Cook times give frame—best judge by color change, texture at edges. Blanch green beans in salted boiling water for 3 minutes, plunge in ice water to halt cooking and fix color. Toss almonds last, warm only enough to release aroma—overheating burns oil, bitterness follows. Use pan residual heat for quick warming; saves washing. Apply sauce to salmon last to keep crispy texture longer, otherwise coating breaks down crust. Serve immediately before seeds lose crunch and glaze thickens hard. Leftover sauce can be saved, but reheat gently to avoid burning sugars."
tips:
- "Start by blending the tamari and maple syrup. Watch for the glaze. Thick sauce means more flavor. Stir frequently towards end. Keep heat steady ."
- "For the salmon, dry well before cooking. Season with lots of salt and pepper. Skin side down enhances crispiness. Flip with a wide spatula. Keep timing tight."
- "Blanching green beans is key. Salted boiling water, 3 minutes. Plunge into ice water after. Locks color, crunch. Toss with almonds last; just warm gently."
- "Searing salmon, listen for the sizzle. Too quiet? Add oil or boost heat. Careful not to crowd. Each fillet needs space to crisp. Visual cues mean everything."
- "Sauce application matters. Spoon over salmon last. Needs to coat but not pool. Gives that sticky sheen. Serve right away, texture declines if left too long."
faq:
- "q: How long to cook salmon? a: Depends on thickness. For average fillet, 10 minutes total. 6 minutes one side, then flip. Look for opaqueness."
- "q: What if the sauce is too thick? a: Add a bit of water. Heat gently, stir. Should flow easily over salmon. If too thin, cook longer."
- "q: Can I use different vegetables? a: Absolutely. Broccoli, snap peas work. Just blanch same as beans. Keep textures in mind; avoid limp veggies."
- "q: What's the best way to store leftovers? a: Keep salmon and green beans separate. Refrigerate both in airtight containers. Lasts 2-3 days."
