- "1 ml (1/4 tsp) salt"
- "180 g (3/4 cup) unsalted cold butter diced"
- "85 ml (5 1/2 tbsp) cold ice water"
- "1 egg beaten"
- "1/2 tsp crushed cardamom seeds"
- "===Blueberry Filling==="
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) cornstarch"
- "200 g (1 1/4 cup) frozen blueberries"
- "10 ml (2 tsp) fresh lemon juice"
- "20 g (1 tbsp) chopped fresh mint leaves"
- "15 g (1 tbsp) brown sugar"

- "5 ml (1 tsp) lemon juice"
instructions:
- "===Dough==="
- "1. Pulse flour, sugar, salt, and cardamom in food processor. Add butter. Pulse to pea-sized crumbs. Pour in water bit by bit until dough barely holds. Hand form into two rectangles. Wrap in plastic. Chill 50 min."
- "===Filling==="
- "2. Off heat, mix sugar and cornstarch in saucepan. Add blueberries, lemon juice, and mint. Heat medium-low until thick, 1-3 min, stirring. Cool. Refrigerate 1 hr."
- "===Assemble==="
- "3. Preheat oven 205 °C (400 °F). Line baking sheet with parchment or silicone mat."
- "4. Flour surface. Roll one dough piece to 34 x 16 cm (13 1/2 x 6 1/4 inch). Cut into eight 8.5 cm (3 1/4 inch) squares. Place on sheet. Spoon 25 ml (1 2/3 tbsp) filling in centers. Keep chilled."
- "5. Roll second dough to same size. Cut eight squares. Slash each with cross-shaped cuts in center."
- "6. Brush edges around filling with beaten egg. Cover with slashed squares. Pinch edges to seal with fork. Brush tops with egg."
- "7. Bake 22–23 min until golden. Cool 25 min on rack."
- "===Glaze==="
- "8. Whisk sugar, yogurt, and lemon juice until pourable, add more lemon juice if needed."
- "9. Dip tops of turnovers in glaze. Let excess drip off. Set on rack. Let glaze set at room temp about 20 min."
- "Store airtight up to 3 days room temp."
introduction: "Flaky dough with a whisper of cardamom seeds. Piping cold, buttery paste chilling before it gets shaped. Blueberries, frozen, released from icy grip to mingle with brown sugar and zing of lemon. Mint chopped fine, stirred in just before cooking thickens the fruit into jewel-toned filling. Cross-cut tops breathing air while baking. An egg wash glosses golden. Greek yogurt glaze drizzled with sharp citrus cools sticky. Crunch from the fork seals. Timed short and sweet in oven. Rustic yet refined, a fresh take. Store easy. Triples the usual maple syrup."
ingredientsNote: "Reduced flour a bit for tenderness and lowered butter to reduce heaviness. Cut sugar slightly for tart balance. Swapped cream sour with Greek yogurt — tangier, thick, protein punch. Added crushed cardamom to dough, tiny spice pops, fragrant without overpower. Mint adds lift to blueberry filling; fresh herbs not common in turnovers but bring brightness. Brown sugar folded with fruit for earthiness. Cornstarch rather than potato starch thickens blueberry juices quickly and cleanly. Water chilled but used instead of cream sour for hydration and lighter crumb. Egg wash seals, gives color and shine. Glaze thinned a little for drizzle, not glop."
instructionsNote: "Start with cold tools and ingredients. Pulse dough gently, don’t overwork — pea-size butter crumbs mean flakiness. Chill dough rectangles wrapped well; shorter time than original, still firm. Making filling off heat protects delicate mint, thickening finish done gently to avoid crushing berries. Assembling on floured surface, keep dough cool, handle lightly. Cross cuts let steam escape, prevents soggy bottom. Egg wash on edges ensures seal, neat shape. Bake on center rack, watch for golden tips. Cool enough for glaze to stick but stay moist. Dip on glaze with quick motion so turnover doesn’t get soggy but has sheen. Let set fully before serving or storing."
tips:
- "Chill all ingredients. Helps achieve flaky texture. Use ice water in dough. Cut the butter into pea-sized pieces. Don’t overwork the dough. Wrap and rest."
- "Fresh blueberries or frozen? Frozen preferred here. Releases juice when heated. Simmer gently. Avoid crushing berries. Add herbs like mint last for freshness."
- "Egg wash is important. Seals edges well. Brushed on tops give sheen. Bake until golden. Center rack works best. Watch closely, don’t burn."
- "Make glaze thinner if needed. Adjust lemon juice to personal taste. Drizzle over turnovers after cooling. Let set before serving. Glaze keeps it moist."
- "Experiment with spices. Nutmeg or cinnamon could be interesting. Add sugar for a crispy topping pre-bake. Store leftovers airtight. Thaw before glazing."
faq:
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep them in an airtight container. Room temp for up to 3 days. For longer, freeze before glazing. Just thaw later."
- "q: Can I use fresh blueberries? a: Absolutely. Adjust cooking time. Less simmering. Gently fold into filling. Preserve the shape."
- "q: What if filling leaks during baking? a: Try slashing tops deeper next time. Helps steam escape without bursting. Pinch edges tightly too."
- "q: Can I use different fruits? a: Yes, mix fruit if desired. Cherries or peaches could work. Adjust sugar based on sweetness. Test cooking times."
