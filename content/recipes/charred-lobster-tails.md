description: "Grilled lobster tails with a citrus garlic butter twist. Olive oil swapped for avocado oil to handle heat better. Butter, garlic, fresh thyme, lemon peel zest, and a pinch of smoked sea salt create a punchy, sticky sauce. Lobster shells split open for direct contact but don’t pull out meat prematurely. Cook skin side first for caramelized crust. Use metal skewers soaked in water or thick rosemary sprigs for aroma and stability. Grill at medium heat, watch for muscle contraction and opaque color, not clock. Paprika replaced with cayenne for subtle heat and earthiness. Timing flexible based on tail size and grill temp, texture primary guide."

ingredients:
- "4 lobster tails about 5-6 oz each"
- "4 tbsp unsalted butter"
- "3 garlic cloves minced"
- "1 tsp lemon zest finely grated"
- "2 tsp fresh thyme leaves chopped"
- "1/2 tsp smoked sea salt divided"
- "1/4 tsp cracked black pepper"
- "2 tbsp avocado oil"
- "1/2 tsp cayenne pepper"
instructions:
- "Gently loosen lobster meat from shell using fingers or small knife, don’t detach. Butterfly tails lengthwise with kitchen shears. Remove intestinal vein carefully."
- "Thread each tail horizontally through a soaked metal or rosemary skewer to keep shape on grill. Brush meat with avocado oil and sprinkle half teaspoon smoked sea salt evenly."
- "Light a grill to medium heat (400°F). Place tails skin side down on the lower rack. Listen for subtle sizzling, don’t rush sear. Cook for 7-8 minutes until shells darken and edges of meat start tightening."
- "Flip tails meat side down now. Grill 3-4 minutes more until flesh turns white and pearly with slight browning. Flesh should feel firm but springy, not rubbery, internal temp about 140°F if using thermometer."
- "Meanwhile melt butter on low in a small saucepan. Add minced garlic and lemon zest. Sprinkle chopped thyme and cracked pepper. Stir gently for 1-2 minutes until fragrant, watch carefully so garlic doesn’t burn."
- "Remove from heat. Ladle sauce over lobster tails off grill while hot, allowing butter to pool into shell crevices. Dust with cayenne pepper for kick and visual pop."
- "Let rest 2-3 minutes. Serve immediately. If sauce firms up, rewarm gently to fluid state. Leftover lemon butter stores in fridge; reheat slowly or microwave carefully to avoid breaking."
introduction: "Shells cracked open, flesh loosened but held in place. Lobster tails grilled over medium heat—slow enough for even cooking, fast enough to lock moisture. Butter melting, garlic sizzling low, thyme dropping fresh aromas. Avocado oil swapped in for olive oil. Why? Higher smoke point, less bitter smoke. Flesh turns white, opaque, edges caramelize. Don’t trust minutes alone; feel the firmness. Undercooked feels slippery, overcooked rubbery. Cayenne gives a subtle nudge after dusting, bright red on creamy shells. Sounds of shell crackling on warm coals, butter bubbling between shell and meat—signs to watch. Rest briefly before serving to keep juices inside. No rush in kitchen, just focus on senses."
ingredientsNote: "Butter can be replaced with ghee or clarified butter for nuttier flavor and higher smoke point. Avocado oil chosen for heat stability but melted coconut oil works too if flavor allows. Fresh thyme swaps easily with rosemary or tarragon depending on preference—herbs add brightness and cut richness. Smoked sea salt lends complexity compared to regular kosher salt. Garlic amount adjustable, minced fine to avoid big chunks burning on heat. Lemon zest must be fresh—grated finely, not pithy, or sauce will turn bitter. Skewers—metal preferred for reusability, soaked wood works if thick and soaked well, rosemary sprigs inject subtle scent and secure meat tightly."
instructionsNote: "Butterflying lobster tails ensures even exposure to heat and quick cooking. Don’t remove meat from shells prematurely, they act as natural insulators, hold shape, and prevent drying. Soaking wooden skewers before use prevents flare-ups and holds tails flat. Cooking skin side first avoids sticking, promotes shell caramelization. Listen for gentle sizzling, avoid hard sears to keep lobster tender. Meat changes color distinctly—opaque white with gentle browning signals readiness. Internal temp of 140°F confirms doneness but muscle firming by touch is key; lobster should spring back when pressed. Lemon garlic thyme butter sauce is added after grilling to avoid burnt garlic taste. If butter hardens, gentle reheating restores fluidity. Cayenne dust finishes with visual and flavor contrast, replacing paprika’s earthiness with subtle heat. Resting lobster before serving lets juices redistribute, prevents dryness. If grill is uneven, use indirect heat after searing to cook through without burning."
tips:
- "Butterflying lobster tails crucial. Expose meat to heat evenly. Avoid cutting through flesh. Helps cook faster, retains moisture too."
- "Char with skin side down first. It seals juices. Caramelizes edges. Listen for that sizzle. Medium heat key. Don't rush!"
- "Garlic can burn fast. Keep heat low when cooking it with butter. Adds nice flavor. But watch it closely. Adjust timing when possible."
- "Skewers help shape tails on grill. Don’t let them curl up. Metal or soaked wooden ones are best. Rosemary also infuses flavor."
- "Let lobster rest after grilling. Keeps juices inside. Don't cut right away. Patience matters. Output quality. Sauce can firm up. Reheat gently."
faq:
- "q: How do I know lobster is cooked? a: Look for opaque color, edges firming. Squeeze gently. Should spring back. Internal temp around 140F but feel matters."
- "q: Can I use old lobster tails? a: Fresh is best. Frozen okay if thawed slowly. Old smell is bad sign, meat texture suffers. Avoid if unsure."
- "q: What if I don’t have avocado oil? a: Any oil with high smoke point works. Grapeseed, canola, or even ghee. Just watch flavor profile ok?"
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate tightly covered. Use within few days. Reheat carefully in microwave or on stove. Avoid overcooking again."
