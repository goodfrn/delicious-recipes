description: "Shrimp sautéed till opaque, tossed in a rich sauce made from cream, goat cheese, and fresh basil pesto. Pasta cooked just right with reserved water to adjust texture. Garlicky butter oil base builds flavor depth. Quick skillet method keeps shrimp tender. Replacing Parmesan with tangy goat cheese adds brightness. Using olive oil with butter prevents burning while letting garlic release aromas. Simple sauce thickens as cheese melts into cream. Pasta water loosens sauce if dry. Timing shrimp doneness by color, sauce by texture. Balanced salt, pepper, garlic—nothing overpowered. Pasta retains bite with no rinsing. Fast under 30 minutes."

ingredients:
- "12 ounces fettuccine or linguine"
- "1 tablespoon unsalted butter"
- "1 1/2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil"
- "3 large garlic cloves minced"
- "1 pound raw shrimp peeled and deveined"
- "salt and black pepper to taste"
- "3/4 cup heavy cream"
- "1/3 cup crumbled goat cheese"
- "1/2 cup fresh basil pesto"
- "1/2 cup reserved pasta cooking water"
instructions:
- "=== Boil pasta without rinsing ==="
- "Fill pot generously with salted water, bring to rolling boil. Add fettuccine or linguine, stir initial minute to prevent sticking. Cook until al dente but still with a bite—the package times are a guide but test early starting at 2 minutes before given. Drain pasta but reserve 1/2 cup pasta water for sauce adjustment. Do not rinse pasta or sauce won’t cling."
- "=== Sauté garlic and shrimp ==="
- "Heat butter and olive oil over medium heat in a large skillet. Butter provides richness; olive oil raises the smoke point. Once butter foams and scents of garlic start to bloom, add minced garlic. Stir garlic for about 60 seconds or until fragrant but not browned—bitter garlic ruins the base. Toss in shrimp seasoned with salt and pepper. Notice shrimp change from translucent to pearl white with pinkish undertones, tails curling slightly. Once completely opaque and just firm (not rubbery), remove shrimp promptly to avoid overcooking, set aside."
- "=== Create creamy goat cheese pesto sauce ==="
- "Lower heat to medium-low. Pour heavy cream into skillet, allowing it to gently simmer—not boil—to avoid curdling. Stir in goat cheese crumbles gradually, letting them melt fully into cream. Goat cheese adds tang and a slight fresher edge compared to Parmesan’s saltiness. Now fold in fresh basil pesto until sauce becomes velvety and evenly green, stirring continuously for 4–6 minutes. Sauce thickens and clings to spoon. If you get any grainy texture from cheese, keep stirring on low heat until smooth. Resist high heat here."
- "=== Combine shrimp, pasta, and sauce ==="
- "Return shrimp to sauce, tossing to coat so flavors meld. Add drained pasta directly to skillet. Using tongs, toss pasta gently to distribute sauce and shrimp throughout. If sauce feels too thick or clings heavily, slowly add reserved pasta water one tablespoon at a time until sauce reaches a light clinging consistency—silky but not soupy. Taste and adjust salt and pepper if needed. Serve immediately—pasta continues cooking in sauce, so timing matters."
introduction: "Shrimp paired with creamy pesto pasta. Nothing complicated. Garlic hits first; butter and oil keep it from burning. Shrimp cooks fast—watch that opaque color. Swap Parmesan for goat cheese to brighten, make sauce less heavy but still rich. Sauce thickens slowly on low heat. Pasta water is your friend—thick sauce needs thinning without losing flavor. Pasta finished al dente, maintained texture. No rinsing; want starch to cling. Real kitchen skills here—watch timing, trust senses. Shrimp bellies crisp if overcooked, sauce breaks if overheated. Focus on smells, colors, textures. Simple ingredients, smart methods."
ingredientsNote: "Use shrimp raw, peeled, deveined for even cooking. Butter olive oil combo raises smoke point yet delivers richness. Fresh basil pesto adds herbal brightness; homemade or store brand fine but stir well before using. Goat cheese replaces Parmesan for mellow sharpness and melting quality. Heavy cream binds sauce, but monitor heat or it splits. Pasta shape like fettuccine or linguine holds sauce better than thinner strands. Keep pasta water—it’s key to adjusting sauce without diluting flavor. Garlic minced fresh, not powdered, to ensure aroma and texture. Salt shrimp lightly since pesto already salty. Black pepper freshly cracked is best."
instructionsNote: "Boiling pasta well-salted makes difference in seasoning final dish. Save 1/2 cup pasta water—starchy and hot, it ties sauce and pasta together. Watch garlic closely; burnt garlic ruins flavor at base. Cook shrimp just until opaque; overcooked shrivels toughens texture. Remove shrimp early—they carry heat and continue cooking off pan. Making sauce low and slow important to melt goat cheese smoothly without graininess or separation. Fold pesto in at end so basil flavor stays fresh, not cooked off. Toss pasta and shrimp off heat or very low heat to prevent sauce from thickening too much. Add pasta water sparingly to keep sauce balanced. Serve fast—sauce thickens as it cools."
tips:
- "Use fresh garlic always. Minced fine. Smell matters. Cooking too fast burns garlic. Keep an eye. Add shrimp only after aromas bloom."
- "Pasta choose fettuccine or linguine. Holds sauce better. Al dente is key. Cook time varies. Don’t rely on package; test early. No rinse."
- "If sauce gets too thick later, pasta water is essential. Add slowly. Look for silky texture. Rotate pot while adding; prevents splashes."
- "Use raw shrimp, peeled and deveined. Avoid overcooking—remove when opaque. They keep cooking off heat. Check color closely; tails curl."
- "Want balance on salt? Pesto can be salty. Light sprinkle on shrimp only. Fresh cracked black pepper—just right. Not too coarse."
faq:
- "q: How do I know if shrimp is cooked properly? a: Look for opaque color, not transparent. Should curl too. Cooks fast, keep checking."
- "q: What if my sauce is grainy? a: Low heat, keep stirring. Let cheese melt fully, avoid high temp or it splits. Add cream slow."
- "q: Can I substitute other cheeses? a: Yes, use cream cheese or ricotta. Adjust tanginess. Goat cheese provides unique flavor—try it."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep in airtight container. Refrigerate only 2-3 days. Reheat on low, add water to revive creaminess."
