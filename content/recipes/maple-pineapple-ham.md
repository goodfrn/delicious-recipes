ingredients:
- "8-9 pound boneless ham"
- "2/3 cup pineapple juice (reserve from canned pineapple or fresh)"
- "2/3 cup dark brown sugar"
- "1/3 cup pure maple syrup"
- "2 teaspoons whole grain Dijon mustard"
- "16 whole cloves"
- "20 ounce can pineapple rings (10-12 rings)"
- "12 maraschino cherries"
- "toothpicks"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 310°F. Use high-sided roasting pan to catch drippings and prevent spillage."
- "In a bowl, whisk pineapple juice, dark brown sugar, maple syrup, and Dijon mustard until sugar dissolves; this will form the glaze. Set aside at room temp."
- "Pierce the ham with whole cloves at even intervals. Insert firmly to avoid falling out during cooking. Cloves release essential oils gradually; more can overpower."
- "Arrange pineapple rings on ham surface, spacing evenly. Secure each ring’s center with a maraschino cherry using a toothpick. Use toothpicks lengthwise to avoid moving parts during roasting."
- "Brush the ham once with about a third of the glaze before placing in oven. Generous coating protects from drying and begins caramelization."
- "Roast uncovered for approx. 2 hours 35 minutes, basting glaze over ham every 18-22 minutes. The smell of caramelizing sugars and pineapple juices will intensify."
- "Use instant-read thermometer inserted in thickest part away from bone or fat. When it hits 145°F the ham is safe and juicy. Pull early if temp edges near 150°F to prevent drying."
- "After roasting, remove ham and let rest 15 minutes. Resting lets juices redistribute—skip and you lose moistness. Remove cloves, pineapple rings, cherries, and discard toothpicks carefully."
- "Slice ham thick or thin per preference. Warm remaining glaze gently; brush over slices to renew shine and moisture before plating. Serve pineapple and cherries on the side for optional sweetness."
- "If you lack pineapple juice, substitute apple juice with a splash of vinegar or lemon for acidity. Dark brown sugar can be replaced by molasses for deeper flavor. Smooth mustard can be whole grain instead for texture contrast."
- "If glaze starts burning during roasting, tent ham loosely with foil. Too high heat hardens sugars and ruins crust. Conversely, if not caramelizing, increase temp slightly last 10 minutes but watch closely."
- "Collect drippings to make a sauce: add a splash of pineapple juice and simmer down to thicken. Serve warm over sliced ham."
- "Leftover glaze can be boiled briefly and stored for a week refrigerated to reuse on sandwiches or as a dipping sauce."
introduction: "Ham resting on a board, studded with cloves. Sweet caramel scent fills room. Don’t rush glaze—it needs time to meld flavors and coat evenly. Pineapple’s acidity balances maple’s richness. Watch caramel color in oven window; it signals when sugars have set and edges start to darken. Overbaking dries meat; under cooking leaves it gummy. Testing temp with probe is smarter than just time alone. Cherries pop out with bright red contrast to golden pineapple—eye candy and flavor boosters. This isn’t fancy folk fare; it’s weekend cooking reined in by discipline. Don’t skip resting after heat. That silent period is flavor magic, juice retention. Slice, brush glaze, serve. Simplicity with work shows through."
ingredientsNote: "Reserving pineapple juice—don’t toss the canned pineapple liquid. It’s packed with natural sugars and acids that help balance the maple and brown sugar’s sweetness. Dark brown sugar gives moisture and depth, use molasses if you want richer sweetness. Maple syrup is vital for a good crust; cheaper pancake syrup won’t hold up or caramelize properly. Cloves release oils slowly; don’t crowd the ham or it’ll be bitter. Whole grain mustard adds textural grit and tang; use smooth if you prefer less bite but it impacts adhesion of glaze. Maraschino cherries aren't strictly needed but add color and bursts of flavor—consider dried cherries if fresh not available. Toothpicks keep pineapple in place but remember to remove them before serving or guests choke. Cutting evenly sized pineapple rings ensures even cooking and presentation."
instructionsNote: "Starting at 310°F shortens cooking but monitor glaze closely to prevent burning; if glaze starts darkening too much, foil tent to protect without steaming. Poke cloves deep enough to stick but don’t stab too deep or they’ll fall out when flipping or basting. Arranging pineapple/cherries can be done freestyle but keep spacing even—crowding traps steam and makes pineapple mushy. Basting every 20 minutes ensures layered glaze buildup. Use a soft pastry brush for even coverage; cheap brushes shed and cloud pan. Leave uncovered for crisp edges and caramelization, cover only if it threatens to dry out. Don’t rely purely on clock. Thicker hams take longer, thinner less. Use instant-read thermometer for precision. Rest ham covered loosely with foil; juices stay, meat firms mildly. When slicing, firm ham with carving fork for clean cuts. Warm glaze rebrushed on slices lifts appearance and flavor, keeps slices moist. Save drippings for sauce or glaze refire—never waste liquids. Experiment with glaze: add a splash of bourbon or ginger for a twist, but keep basics balanced."
tips:
- "Start with ham's weight—8-9 pounds adds time. Monitor closely; each ham cooks differently. Adjust basting intervals if needed. Keep an eye on caramelizing."
- "Clove spacing matters. Too close, bitter notes arise. Test flavor for balance; you want warmth, not overbearing. Rotate honey as a sweetener if necessary."
- "Basting is essential. Every 18-22 mins helps build depth. You lose moisture without it. Use the same bowl; don’t waste drippings. Rewarm glaze for shine."
- "If using apple juice, add lemon for brightness. Pineapple juice is key for flavor balance. No juice? Try flavored vinegars. Simple swaps but impactful."
- "Burning glaze? Tent with foil if needed. Protect edges without steaming. Too high heat dries out; also, don’t skip resting. 15 minutes under foil after roasting."
faq:
- "q: Best thermometer placement? a: Insert in thickest part, avoid bone. Too close gives false readings. Test intervals to ensure accurate temps."
- "q: Can I use fresh pineapple? a: Yes, fresh adds acidity but may alter texture. Swap with canned if in doubt; more consistent sweetness."
- "q: What if glaze isn't caramelizing? a: Increase oven temp slightly for last few mins—stay close. Watch sugars closely; too much can harden."
- "q: Storage options for leftovers? a: Refrigerate sliced ham; keeps well for a week. Freeze if longer. Use leftovers for sandwiches too."
