ingredients:
- "1 cup dry vermouth"
- "1/3 cup avocado oil"
- "4 cloves garlic smashed"
- "1 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"
- "1 1/2 pounds large shrimp peeled and deveined"
- "1 small zucchini sliced into half-moons"
- "1 medium red onion cut into chunks"
- "1 pint cherry tomatoes"
- "4-6 wooden skewers soaked for 30 minutes"
- "1 lemon zested"
- "Minced parsley optional"
- "Flaky sea salt optional"
instructions:
- "Whisk vermouth, avocado oil, garlic, kosher salt, black pepper in medium bowl until integrated. Note: avocado oil offers higher smoke point and a subtle nutty taste unlike olive oil."
- "Add shrimp, coat evenly. Cover, refrigerate. Marinate 30 minutes to 6 hours max. Excess salt extraction risks rubbery texture. Too long ruins shrimp."
- "Prep skewers by soaking at least 30 minutes to prevent burning and splinters. Use bamboo or metal if available, no soaking needed for metal."
- "Thread shrimp, zucchini half-moons, onion chunks, cherry tomatoes alternating on skewers. Leave 1-2 inch space top and bottom for grip. Shrimp should sit snug, but not crowded to ensure even heat."
- "Preheat grill to medium indirect heat. Clean grates thoroughly. Oil grates with tongs and paper towel soaked in avocado oil for non-stick."
- "Place skewers on indirect heat zone. Hear slight sizzle, smell garlic mingling with smoky aromas. Cook 8-10 minutes turning every 2-3 minutes. Shrimp firmness and color shift from translucent gray to opaque pink signal doneness. Light char on veggies welcome."
- "Remove skewers. Sprinkle lemon zest immediately for bright citrus pop. Parsley and flaky sea salt finish optional but add layered texture and herbaceous kick."
- "Serve hot off grill. Watch for overcooking shrimp - tough, rubbery, avoided by timely flipping and pulling at firm pink stage."
introduction: "Shrimp needs finesse or it turns rubber. Marinade matters more than you think. Swapping white wine for vermouth ups the aromatic game without overpowering shrimp. Avocado oil handles heat better. Marinating short window, never soak hours on end or you'll pay in texture. Skewers soaking is not just tradition, critical or they burn and splinter your beautiful grill marks. Flip shrimp often, watch color changes closely. Touch them; they firm up as they cook. Garlic and vermouth create a sweet, sharp note that coasts over smoky charred zucchini and onion. Zest lemon last to wake everything up. Parsley and flaky salt boost bites with fresh crunch and herb punch if you want to layer complexity post-grill. Real grilling is watching, feeling, smelling every step."
ingredientsNote: "Use dry vermouth instead of white wine for a more complex umami note; avoid sweet or infused varieties. Avocado oil replaces olive oil to prevent smoking and adds a subtle nutty background. Fresh garlic smashed provides intense pungency compared to powder or minced garlic which bake off too fast. Kosher salt is ideal for controlling salting more evenly than table salt. Substitute zucchini here for yellow squash if preference or availability. Cherry tomatoes resist falling apart better than grape tomatoes on heat; they hold shape but still burst sweetly. If wooden skewers aren't soaked, they ignite — soaking helps preserve their integrity. Parsley is optional but adds fresh herbal brightness after grilling. Flaky sea salt delivers a satisfying crunch without overwhelming."
instructionsNote: "Start by whisking marinade ingredients well; this ensures salt dissolves uniformly preventing spots of over-salting on shrimp. Marinate shrimp no more than 6 hours to avoid protein breakdown, which makes texture rubbery and off-balances flavors. Skewers must soak minimum 30 minutes when wooden, or switch to metal for easier grilling. Thread shrimp and veggies with slight spacing so heat circulates evenly, avoids steaming. Grill on indirect heat zone to prevent shrimp curdling or burning while getting gradual char. Flip skewers every 2-3 minutes to cook evenly. Visual cues over timers—shrimp turn opaque pink with firm elasticity when done, veer toward dry if overcooked. Adding lemon zest post-grill wakes up flavors without making shrimp mushy. Parsley garnish and flaky salt applied at end enhance crunch and freshness. Avoid piercing shrimp with sharp knife during prep to maintain juices. Clean and oil grill grate well before use to minimize sticking."
tips:
- "Watch shrimp closely. Visual cues matter. Color shifts from gray to pink. Firm texture key. Timing isn’t everything."
- "Use dry vermouth for sharp flavor. It elevates without overpowering. Avoid sweet varieties—balance is crucial."
- "Zucchini swaps fine for yellow squash. Choose what’s on hand. Both are great options for this mix."
- "Wooden skewers need soaking. Helps prevent burning. If you forget, use metal; no soaking, still effective."
- "Flip shrimp regularly. Keeps cooking even. Don't overcook. Pull when they feel firm, pink but still tender."
faq:
- "q: Can I use other oils? a: Yes, grapeseed or peanut oils work well. They handle heat well. Avoid oils that smoke too easily."
- "q: What's the best marinating time? a: 30 minutes is good. No more than 6 hours. Longer can ruin texture; shrimp become rubbery."
- "q: What if I can’t find cherry tomatoes? a: Grape tomatoes or bell peppers work as substitutes. Cherry is ideal but still use what’s available."
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Store in airtight containers; refrigerate for 2-3 days. But shrimp do not freeze well; can become mushy."
