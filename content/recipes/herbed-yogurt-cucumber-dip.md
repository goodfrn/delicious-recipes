ingredients:
- "500 ml plain Greek yogurt 10 fat, full cream preferably"
- "1 large English cucumber peeled, seeded, grated coarsely"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) apple cider vinegar"
- "2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) kosher salt"
- "2 cloves garlic, minced to fine paste"
- "60 ml extra virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzle"
- "30 ml fresh basil finely chopped"
- "15 ml fresh dill chopped"
- "1/4 tsp smoked paprika"
- "Toasted thick crusty bread or grilled pita, warm"
- "Optional: sliced black olives for garnish"
instructions:
- "Line a fine mesh sieve with 3 layers cheesecloth or thick paper towel; place over a bowl large enough to catch dripping whey."
- "Transfer yogurt to sieve; cover loosely with plastic wrap. Refrigerate 5 to 7 hours. Look for dense yogurty semi-solid texture with little drip. Discard whey collecting below."
- "Meanwhile, grate peeled cucumber coarsely. Sprinkle salt on cucumber, toss to combine. Let sit 8 to 12 minutes to draw out liquid."
- "Press cucumber in sieve or squeeze in a towel to remove excess moisture. Moisture will water down final dip—too wet wrecks creamy texture."
- "In mixing bowl, fold strained yogurt, drained cucumber, garlic paste, vinegar, olive oil, basil, dill, smoked paprika. Mix vigorously about 1-2 minutes till mixture looks cohesive and slightly glossy."
- "Taste. Adjust salt. Add fresh cracked pepper if desired."
- "Transfer dip to shallow bowl. Drizzle extra olive oil over surface. Sprinkling additional dill or basil. Optionally scatter sliced black olives."
- "Serve immediately or chilled up to 6 hours. Bring out about 10 minutes before serving from fridge so not icy cold."
- "Accompany with warm, charred pita or thick rustic toast, enough to scoop without tearing."
- "Variations: swap basil for tarragon or chervil for subtle anise notes. Add a teaspoon grated lemon zest for brightness if you want punch."
introduction: "Forget watery, bland spreads where yogurt drips off your spoon. Thickening yogurt is non-negotiable — whey drains off, leaving dense creaminess that clings. Texture is foundation here. Relying purely on cucumber moisture? Recipe tanks. Press that grated cucumber well; salt coaxing water out is a must but not a magic fix. Herbs swapped—basil for mint, dill for an added layer. Smoked paprika creeps in for understated warmth, not overwhelming or traditional, just enough to play off fresh coolness. Garlic is in paste form, no large chunks. Olive oil isn’t an afterthought — emulsifying it integrates fat into yogurt, creamy mouthfeel elevated. Serving with warm bread adds crunch and heat contrast. Dip brings punch to plain pita or toast. No fluff, just layered flavor and the kind of texture that makes you keep dipping. Atmosphere of aromatic kitchen, garlic sharp but mellow, herbs bright and fresh, olive oil lush, a whisper of smoke from paprika. That’s the canvas. Timing flexible but watch visual cues—thickened yogurt, drained cucumber, glossy mix. No soggy mess. Practical, memorable."
ingredientsNote: "Using full-fat Greek yogurt thickened by draining is key. Avoid low fat yogurts—they release more liquid, inconsistent texture. Straining yogurt overnight up to 8 hours is typical but 5-7 hours when in a cooled fridge works if well lined sieve is used. Cheesecloth layers or thick paper towel prevents yogurt seeping below, increasing strain efficiency. English cucumber preferred for mildness and fewer seeds; skin removed to avoid bitterness. Press grated cucumber firmly to avoid watery dip—excess liquid dilutes richness and breaks emulsification. Garlic minced to paste ensures even roughness, no overpowering chunks. Swap mint for fresh basil for herbal twang that's less common with tzatziki but harmonizes well. Dill remains classic herb accent but balanced with basil. Smoked paprika adds subtle background note replacing oregano for mild earthiness without harshness. Use good quality olive oil, as final drizzle is flavor highlight. If unavailable, mild buttery oil can substitute but oil richness will suffer. Bread must be thick and toasted for proper scoop support; flimsy pita tears."
instructionsNote: "Strain yogurt properly using large fine mesh sieve lined with 3 layers cheesecloth or several paper towels. Avoid single layer or thin cloth—it will let yogurt drip through too fast or clog. Watch for yogurt to look dense and creamy with minimal liquid dripping below. Discard collected whey. Salt sprinkled on grated cucumber draws moisture by osmosis. Letting sit minimum 8 minutes ensures proper drainage. Pressing grated cucumber by hand or with fine mesh sieve critical; leftover moisture is biggest rookie mistake that ruins dip texture, making it runny. Mixing vigorously is essential to emulsify olive oil into yogurt creating smooth consistent body. Gentle folding won't create proper texture. Garlic paste folds evenly and aromas release slowly. Taste after initial mixing; salt adjustment often needed depending on yogurt saltiness. Adding fresh cracked pepper can deepen flavor. Serve dip slightly chilled but not ice cold; too cold deadens aroma and flavors. Allow plain yogurt to sit out 10 minutes before serving for aroma to bloom. Olive oil drizzle and herb garnish at service add visual cue and fresh aroma, plus richness. Toast bread until just crisped but not burnt; warmish bread carries aroma and offers structural contrast for dipping. Control of texture and temperature makes difference between forgettable and memorable."
tips:
- "Strain yogurt thoroughly, prevents watery mess. Lined sieve crucial; cheesecloth does wonders. Squeeze out the whey, you'll see a richer dip. No shortcuts here."
- "Cucumber prep matters, salt it wisely. Let sit to draw moisture. If it's too wet, dip's trashed. Press firmly; avoid tepid results. Texture wins."
- "Garlic paste is key. No chunks, just even flavor. Mince finely; mix into yogurt for even taste. Dark, garlicky perfume blooms with each scoop. Keep it balanced."
- "For herb swaps, tarragon or chervil jazzes this up. Punch with lemon zest if you want. Flavor layers rock—textural hints too. Focus on freshness."
- "Drizzle good quality olive oil at the end. It's not an afterthought; elevates whole dish. Allow dip to sit for 10 minutes before serving to bloom flavors."
faq:
- "q: How to keep dip thick? a: Strain yogurt long enough. Watch for density. Forget low fat; too watery. Cucumber moisture? Squeeze it out completely."
- "q: Want it more flavorful? a: Add herbs, spices as needed. Smoked paprika, a little more garlic for intensity. Go light on salt if yogurt’s salty."
- "q: What if it gets runny? a: Press cucumber well. Straining yogurt an overnight job works, but 5-7 hours will do. Use a good sieve."
- "q: Storage options? a: Store in airtight container up to 6 hours. No longer, it loses charm. Make ahead, but keep the bread separate."
