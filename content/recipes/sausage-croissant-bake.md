ingredients:
- "6 large croissants torn or cut into roughly 1-inch chunks"
- "1 pound ground pork sausage"
- "3 tablespoons unsalted butter"
- "1 medium shallot finely diced"
- "3 cloves garlic minced"
- "1 cup shredded sharp white cheddar cheese"
- "1 cup shredded provolone cheese"
- "8 large eggs"
- "1 cup whole milk"
- "1/2 cup half and half"
- "1 tablespoon grainy Dijon mustard"
- "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"
- "Nonstick cooking spray"
- "2 tablespoons sliced green onions for garnish"
- "Optional hot sauce for finishing"
instructions:
- "Heat oven to 390 degrees Fahrenheit. Spread croissant chunks over parchment on large sheet pan. Bake 7 to 9 minutes, tossing halfway, until edges turn gold and feel dry but not burnt. Let cool. Oven off now."
- "Brown sausage in heavy skillet over med-high, breaking apart until no pink remains and browned bits develop. Drain carefully in colander. Discard grease."
- "Use same skillet, melt butter and add diced shallots. Cook stirring frequently till soft, about 4 minutes or until aromatic and translucent—should smell sweet but not brown. Stir in garlic and cook 30 seconds to release aroma. Transfer shallots and garlic into bowl with sausage."
- "Add toasted croissant pieces plus both cheeses to sausage mix. Stir gently but thoroughly so cheese coats bread and meat evenly."
- "Grease 9x13 inch casserole pan well. Spread croissant-sausage filling in flat, even layer pressing gently to fit snugly but not compacted."
- "Whisk eggs until homogenous, then gradually whisk in milk, half and half, mustard, salt, and pepper. Pour evenly over croissant mixture, pressing edges lightly to soak all bread. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate minimum 1 hour, ideal up to 7 hours or overnight."
- "Preheat oven to 390 again when ready. Remove plastic. Sprinkle provolone or mozzarella evenly on top. Bake uncovered for 38 to 43 minutes. Look for bubbling cheese that turns golden but not charred and puffed custard that jiggles slightly when nudged."
- "If cheese browns too fast before set, tent with foil loosely to finish bake without burning. Rest bake 10 minutes at room temp—structure will firm up for cleaner slicing."
- "Garnish with sliced green onions or fresh parsley and optional hot sauce for heat. Enjoy warm or serve at room temp."
introduction: "Forget plain eggs and sausage on the side. Toasted croissants bring buttery flakiness soaking rich egg custard loaded with sharp cheddar and oozy provolone. Ground pork sausage browned to a brown crust adds punch and texture unmatched by plain breakfast meats. Onion and garlic aromas fill the kitchen as butter sweats slowly, nurturing flavor depth. The grainy Dijon mustard cuts through rich cream and eggs to prevent boredom. Toss together then rest overnight before baking until golden, set, and bubbly for a make-ahead brunch dish. Perfect for weekends or when feeding hungry groups, this dish rewards patience and attention to browning and custard consistency — no soggy pockets or burnt edges here. A practical kitchen project with room for swaps and tweaks, but don't skip the soak step. Show and tell at your next breakfast table."
ingredientsNote: "Croissants not day-old? Toast them longer to remove excess moisture so they soak custard without turning mushy. Use ground pork with balanced fat for juiciness; turkey sausage or spicy chorizo make decent changes if you want variation. Shallots soften gently without overpowering like raw onions. Gruyere replaced by sharp white cheddar for punch plus provolone for creamy melt. Whole milk and half and half balance richness without heaviness — heavy cream alone often yields custard that's overly dense. Dijon mustard introduces a subtle tang, try grainy style to add texture too. Salt and pepper tuning important: too little dulls flavor, too much annoys sensitive palates. Don’t skip butter or sauté shallots properly; it’s where flavor roots. Spoiler: if you go vegan or dairy-free, swap cheeses for nut-based blends and sausage for plant protein but lower the custard soak time."
instructionsNote: "Start warming the oven early when toasting croissants — essential step to get surface dry and prevents soggy casserole interiors. Toss halfway for even coloration but watch for burning edges especially if croissants are thin. Cooking sausage in same pan for onion step saves cleanup and uses residual flavor. Stir shallots often but not aggressively to avoid browning too fast. Garlic added near end to avoid bitterness. After mixing all main solids, spread evenly in casserole dish to ensure uniform cooking and avoid dense pockets that refuse to set. Custard mix whisked separately guarantees smooth consistency; add cream and milk in stages to avoid cracking. Allow soaking time; minimal is one hour but longer means tastier bites. Cover while chilling to prevent off-odors in fridge. Before baking apply cheese topping for browning contrast. Baking times flexible, look for bubbling and golden color not clock. Tent foil if browning too fast. Let bake finish rest undisturbed; slicing hot ruins structure. Garnishes freshen, sauces add personality. Cleanup tip: soak pan immediately after baking—cheese gets stubborn."
tips:
- "Use day-old croissants; fresh ones need more toasting. Cut into chunks for even soaking. Bake till edges are golden. Watch closely, avoid burning."
- "Ground pork is juicy; fat balance is key. Swap for turkey sausage or spicy options if desired. Different flavor profiles available, but cook until browned."
- "Shallots sweeten while cooking, less pungent than onions. Don’t skip garlic, adds depth. Stir gently, avoid browning too fast for best flavor."
- "Custard mix is important. Whisk eggs till smooth, add milk slowly. Helps prevent curdling. Pour over mixture evenly. Don’t rush soaking time, it matters."
- "Rest baked casserole post-oven. Let structure firm up before slicing. Messy cuts ruin presentation. Garnish with green onions or herbs for color."
faq:
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in an airtight container. Should last about three days, but reheat gently for best texture."
- "q: Best way to reheat? a: Oven works well; keeps that crisp top. 350 degrees for 15-20 min. Microwave can make soggy, avoid when possible."
- "q: What if it’s too soggy? a: It might’ve soaked too long. Less soak time next round. Or ensure croissants are well-toasted before mixing."
- "q: Can I freeze this dish? a: Yes, freeze before baking. Thaw overnight in fridge. Bake as directed, but increase time slightly for frozen."
