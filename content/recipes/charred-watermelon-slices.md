ingredients:
- "1 medium seedless watermelon, sliced into 1 inch thick rounds"
- "3 tablespoons avocado oil (or light olive oil)"
- "Maldon sea salt flakes or kosher salt"
- "Freshly ground black pepper"
- "3 tablespoons pomegranate molasses (or sherry vinegar diluted with honey)"
- "100 grams crumbled goat cheese (feta or shaved pecorino works)"
- "1/4 cup chopped fresh mint leaves (basil alternative)"
instructions:
- "===Preparation==="
- "Slice watermelon into thick 1 inch rounds. Pat dry with paper towel to remove excess moisture. This prevents soggy grill marks and reduces flare-ups. Brush both sides lightly with avocado oil. Avocado oil withstands heat well and adds a subtle nutty flavor. Olive oil can burn faster, so use cautiously."
- "===Grilling==="
- "Preheat grill to medium-high. Clean grates thoroughly and oil with a high smoke point oil on a folded paper towel held by tongs. Place watermelon slices on direct heat. Stay put. Don’t move them around. Wait for dark, sharp grill marks and the fruit surface to start glossy and slightly translucent. This usually takes around 3-4 minutes but watch carefully; different grills vary. Flip carefully using tongs."
- "Second side gets same treatment. Look for caramelization – sugars bubbling, edges browning but flesh still holding. If grill flames flare up, move slices briefly to cooler side. Avoid charring or mushy fruit."
- "===Finishing==="
- "Remove watermelon from grill. Season immediately with flaky sea salt and cracked pepper to taste. Drizzle with pomegranate molasses for tangy brightness and gentle viscosity. If unavailable, mix sherry vinegar and honey to replicate acidity and sweetness. Scatter crumbled goat cheese evenly for creamy saltiness. Fresh chopped mint adds a cooling finish and herbaceous contrast. Basil can substitute but mint pairs best here."
- "Serve warm or room temperature. The slight crunch from grilled exterior with juicy interior makes a refreshing, surprising dish."
- "If grill marks don't show, increase heat next time or pat drier. Don’t overcrowd grill or stack slices. One layer only for best results."
introduction: "Grilling watermelon isn’t just for novelty. Turns that sweet, ripe fruit into smoky, textural contrast gold. Start with thick cuts—too thin and it goes mush, too thick won’t heat through enough. Avocado oil replaces olive oil here because it’s stable over the medium-high grill temps needed. Watch for those tell-tale grill marks, dark and precise, and surface starting to look glassy but not soggy. Turn only once. Toppings provide salty punch, acidity, and herb freshness—skip any and it becomes one-note. Goat cheese crumbles melt slightly on the warm slice, lush softness mixing with caramelized sugars. Mint punches through the heat and sweetness. A deceptively simple way to flex grilling muscles without meat. Brushed off dirt and charrating sugar’s crackle. Summer-now vibes, unexpected and serious."
ingredientsNote: "Watermelon is mostly water, so patting slices dry is essential to get clear grill marks and prevent the fruit from steaming rather than charring. Avocado oil is preferred over extra virgin olive oil for its high smoke point, reducing burning and bitterness. Maldon salt flakes add texture and sharp bursts of saltiness; kosher salt works but won't have the same crunch. Goat cheese can be replaced with feta or pecorino depending on preference, each offering different salty profiles. Pomegranate molasses brings thick fruity acidity—if unavailable, make a quick substitute by heating sherry vinegar with a spoonful of honey until syrupy to mimic that balance. Fresh herbs should always be added last to retain brightness and texture."
instructionsNote: "Proper preheating is crucial. Grill should be hot enough to sear without excessive flare-ups. Cleaning and oiling grates ensures watermelon doesn’t stick and tears nicely to release sugars. Resist flipping slices prematurely; wait till grill marks develop and the fruit loosens a bit from the grate. Turn gently with tongs to keep slices intact. Watch for bubbling juices around the edges—signal of caramelization. If the fruit starts leaking excessively or darkens too fast, lower heat. Seasoning right off the grill locks moisture and intensifies flavor by slight dissolution of salt crystals. Drizzle pomegranate molasses sparingly; too much can overpower. Serve warm, not hot. Letting herb garnish rest on surface allows oils to bloom in contact with warm fruit."
tips:
- "Slice watermelon thick—1 inch keeps juices inside. Thin slices risk mush. Pat dry; moisture ruins grill marks. Brush with avocado oil—high smoke point."
- "Clean and oil grill grates well. Use paper towel, tongs—avoids sticking wreck. Preheat until hot; look for smoke. Test grill marks—steak-like patterns desirable."
- "Keep an eye on sugar bubbles, edges browning. If flare-ups, move slices briefly to cooler spot. Minimal flipping. Look for glossy surface; that’s when it’s prime."
- "Season immediately off grill. Salt helps retain moisture. Drizzle pomegranate molasses—sparingly; overpowering can happen. Herb garnish goes last—keeps mint fresh and vibrant."
- "If grill marks don’t show, increase heat next time. Overcrowding causes steaming. Aim for single layer—better charring and flavor development."
faq:
- "q: How do I know when watermelon is done? a: Look for grill marks, glossy texture but not soggy. Stay attentive—overcooked becomes mush."
- "q: Can I use a different oil? a: Yes, light olive oil works but watch heat. Avocado oil preferred; stable under high temps. Use what you have."
- "q: What can I use instead of goat cheese? a: Feta or shaved pecorino also great; different flavors. Adjust based on preference or availability."
- "q: How should I store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container—up to 2 days. Note: texture changes but flavor remains. Consume quick for best taste."
