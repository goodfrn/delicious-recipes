slug: "roasted-tomato-soup"
description: "Roasted tomatoes bring deep caramelized flavors, bubbling with aroma. Croissant croutons add buttery crunch, not your usual crouton move. Garlic swapped with shallots for subtlety. Cream replaced by coconut milk to cut dairy heaviness. Slow roast releases natural sugars, skin blisters, flesh softens to velvet. Soup thickens naturally; no need for flour or starch. Season with smoked paprika for smoky warmth. Splash white wine to lift acidity—never skip that step. Serve piping hot, garnished with fresh herbs. A soup that hums with depth and texture, no filler. Gluten free by choice, nuts omitted—kept straightforward."

ingredients:
- "1.5 kg ripe plum tomatoes, halved"
- "3 shallots, sliced thinly"
- "1 tablespoon smoked paprika"
- "3 tablespoons olive oil"
- "150 ml dry white wine"
- "400 ml coconut milk"
- "Salt as needed"
- "Freshly ground black pepper as needed"
- "2 large croissants, torn into bite-size pieces"
- "30 g unsalted butter"
- "1 sprig thyme"
- "Fresh basil leaves for garnish"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven 190°C (375°F). Line baking tray with parchment. Tomatoes face up. Toss with 2 tablespoons olive oil, sprinkle salt, pepper, paprika. Spread shallots between tomatoes. Roast until skins blister, edges brown—around 50 minutes. Aroma should fill kitchen. Avoid soggy mess by spacing tomatoes. No steam buildup, you want dry heat roasting, not steaming."
- "While roasting, prep croissant croutons. Melt butter in skillet over medium heat. Add torn croissants, thyme sprig for fragrance. Toss to coat buttery goodness, crisp and golden but stay soft inside. Watch closely, butter burns fast. Remove sprig once done. Set aside on paper towels, keeps croutons crisp but soft chew inside."
- "Scrape roasted tomatoes, shallots, any caramelized bits into blender. Add white wine immediately—deglazes pan residues, lifts flavor. Pulse puree till mostly smooth but leave little texture. Over-blending kills character. Pour into heavy-bottomed pot. Warm gently, stir in coconut milk to soften acidity, thicken mouthfeel without cream heaviness."
- "Simmer low 10-15 minutes. Taste for salt, a pinch more if tomatoes speak acidic. Pepper, adjust smoked paprika for smoky depth. No blend again unless chunks bother you—soups need texture, not baby food."
- "Serve hot, ladle into bowls. Scatter croissant croutons on top. Tear fresh basil over everything. Sip soup rich with roasted sweetness, smoky hints, buttery crunch from croissants like surprise bites."
- "Leftovers reheat gently; avoid boiling coconut milk—it breaks down. If soup too thick next day, thin with splash of stock or water."
introduction: "Roasting tomatoes transforms them from bright and sharp to deep, caramelized jewels. No shortcuts—low and slow, skin cracks, juices caramelize, flesh melts into softness. Garlic's swapped with shallots here; milder, sweeter, melts better into this tomato medley. Croissant croutons? Forget stale bread cubes. Butter-fried croissant bits bring crunch with richness—crisp on the outside, tender inside. Coconut milk smoothens tart acidity without dairy heaviness. Smoked paprika runs through the soup like a quiet ember. White wine splash wakes the flavor, prevents flatness in the final bowl. A tactile soup—thick but not gloopy, with bites and crunch. Age-old roasting techniques meet a subtle twist you won’t find in your average tomato soup. Every step serves flavor or texture. No mindless simmering here. The kitchen smells of caramelized earth and buttery warmth. This is soup to slow down for and respect."
ingredientsNote: "Tomatoes—plum or Roma are best for roasting; dense flesh and low water, concentrate sugars nicely. Overripe mushy types turn soupy and dull the roast effect. Shallots replace garlic for gentler aromatics that don’t burn or dominate. Smoked paprika—not paprika powder—gives subtle heat and depth, use sparingly or it will overpower. Coconut milk cuts acidity without dairy heaviness or creaminess that masks roasted flavor. Butter in croissants turns croutons from plain to mouthwatering mini treats. Croissants can be day-old but keep dry, no sogginess or oily slabs. White wine a must for balancing acidity, but dry styles only. No cheap sweet wine—kills the tangy brightness. Fresh basil is not optional here; it lifts and brightens just before serving. Salt wisely; roasting concentrates sodium so start low. Olive oil must be quality—cheap oil bitter when heated at high temps."
instructionsNote: "Roasting takes the longest; space tomatoes so no overlapping, steam ruins the roasting effect and dulls flavor. Look for blistered skin with browned edges. Aroma will shift from sharp tomato to roasted, slightly smoky and sweet. Caramelized shallots add a mellow punch, avoid browning them too much or flavor gets bitter. Croissant croutons require close attention; butter burns fast. Toss gently and remove thyme sprig once croutons brown; it flavors butter without overpowering the delicate croissant taste. Blending—pulse only; overblending removes texture essential in rustic soups. Deglazing roasting tray with wine picks up caramelized bits—a cheap skip here ruins depth. Coconut milk added at end, simmer gently—boiling causes separation. Season soup last; concentrated flavors from roasting reduce salt needs. Reheat care—avoid full boil to keep oils stable and soup’s silkiness intact. Serve immediately for best textural contrast. Garnishing with fresh herbs adds brightness and color, contrast to earthy depths."
tips:
- "Roasting tomatoes takes patience. Skin's blistered? Good. Edges brown? Just right. Smell that sweetness? Signals they’re done. No overcrowding to avoid steaming. Space them."
- "Shallots bring sweet aroma. Milder than garlic. Browning too much? Bitter notes. Watch them closely. Blend tomatoes and deglaze with wine—get all those caramelized bits. Maximum flavor extracted."
- "Croissant croutons need care. Butter burns fast. Medium heat, toss lightly. Golden brown on edges? Soft center? Perfect. Use fresh herbs too—it’s in the details. Adds depth."
- "Soups should be rustic. Pulse, don’t blend into oblivion. Texture matters. Taste for balance last. More salt? Maybe. Acidity too high? Adjust coconut milk slightly without fear."
- "Leftovers next day? Keep gentler reheating. Full boil? No. That separates coconut milk. Thin if necessary—stock or water. Still rich. Different every time, embrace that."
faq:
- "q: Can I use canned tomatoes? a: Yes, but fresh brings better depth. Drain excess liquid if using cans. Adjust seasoning; concentrated flavor varies."
- "q: What if I don’t have croissants? a: Toast bread cubes in olive oil. Butter’s key; brings richness. Texture won’t be quite the same though. Up for creative."
- "q: Common issue with the soup? a: Too acidic? Add a pinch of sugar. Roasted tomatoes should be sweet. Adjust smoked paprika too. It can overwhelm if too much."
- "q: Storage options? a: Refrigerate up to three days. Can freeze too; but coconut milk might separate when stored long. Thaw gently and reheat slowly."
