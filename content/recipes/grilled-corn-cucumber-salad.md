Relaxed, rustic salad showing off sweet, smoky corn aroma balanced with crisp vegetables and fresh herbs. Simple, quick assembly after basic grilling and chopping. Adjust seasoning after chilling due to flavor dulling. A splash of honey for brightness, white wine vinegar for zip.

ingredients:
- "4 ears fresh corn husked"
- "2 pints cherry tomatoes halved"
- "1 large cucumber diced"
- "4 ounces feta cheese crumbled"
- "1 small red onion thinly sliced"
- "1/2 cup chopped scallions both white and green parts"
- "1 lemon zested and juiced"
- "2 tablespoons white wine vinegar"
- "1 tablespoon maple syrup"
- "1/2 teaspoon salt more to taste"
- "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"
- "1 tablespoon olive oil for grilling and dressing"
instructions:
- "Begin with preheated grill at medium heat. Oil grates right before placing corn; prevents sticking and promotes even charring. Arrange ears directly over the heat, turning every few minutes. Look for patches of blackened kernels; don’t over-char or kernels burst. The popping sound signals nearing done. Pull corn off grill; let cool to handle comfortably."
- "While corn cools, cut tomatoes in halves or quarters depending on size. Dice cucumber into bite-sized chunks—peel if waxed or bitter. Slice red onion thinly for crunch but mellow it first in cold water if raw bite is too harsh. Toss vegetables into a large bowl."
- "Position cooled corn vertically on cutting board. Using sharp chef’s knife, slice downward, removing kernels in clusters along the cob. Corn ribs are normal, not broken kernels—adds rustic texture. Immediately add corn to vegetable mix, fold gently so kernels don’t shatter."
- "For dressing, whisk lemon zest and juice with white wine vinegar, maple syrup, salt, and black pepper. Slow drizzle olive oil while continuously whisking until emulsified. Taste before pouring; acidity should balance sweetness but not overpower fresh produce."
- "Combine dressing with salad ingredients. Toss just enough to coat evenly. Cover bowl with plastic wrap or transfer to airtight container. Chill minimum 30 minutes to let flavors meld and for salad to firm up slightly. Retaste just before serving. Add salt or vinegar if diminished flavors."
- "Serve chilled or room temperature. Great with grilled meats or as a standalone light meal. If feta unavailable, use mozzarella balls or cotija. For extra herbaceous layer, sprinkle chopped mint or basil during final toss. Adjust onion quantities if preferred milder."
- "Cleanup tip: Soak knife and cutting board immediately after cutting corn kernels; stuck bits dry fast and tough to remove. For grill marks without a grill, cook corn dry in cast iron skillet on medium high flipping regularly until dark specks form."
introduction: "Grilling corn unlocks a smoky sweetness few can resist. Raw corn’s watery crunch transforms into tender kernels speckled with black char spots. Essential to nail this stage: moderate heat and patient turning. Burnt or undercooked ruins texture, flavor. Pair it with fresh tomatoes and cucumber for contrasting crispness and moisture. Cheese injects creaminess, feta lends tang and salt. Dressing is where balance happens—lemon juice and zest for brightness, maple syrup to offset acidity, and white wine vinegar for bite. Whisked oil ties everything into a harmonious drizzle. Resting salad in fridge lets flavors mingle but don’t skip tasting before serving. Salt and acid dull with chill time. Toss again, tweak seasonings. This dish speaks summer so avoid overcomplication. Simple ingredients, executed precisely, win every time."
ingredientsNote: "Freshness in produce is game changer. Use firm tomatoes with deep color, heavy for their size indicating ripeness. Cucumbers should be firm without bitterness—seedless variety preferred but regular works after removing seeds to reduce moisture diluting salad. Corn, obviously, demands freshness; avoid older cobs with dried silk or kernels. Swap feta for mozzarella for creamier feel or crumbly cotija for sharper salt punch. Honey replaced by maple syrup adds earthiness and suits vegans. Red onion can be softened by a quick soak in cold water or pickled briefly if raw flavor is too strong. Olive oil must be good quality but don’t fear neutral oils if unavailable."
instructionsNote: "Grilling corn evenly requires eye and hand coordination—don’t rush, don’t leave stationary too long or burn. Flip every 2-3 minutes for about 7 minutes total. Use tongs for easy turning. Cooling before cutting kernels prevents juice loss and uneven chopping. Slice kernels downward carefully; pressure breaks kernels and leads to mush. Salad tossed gently preserves kernel integrity and prevents watery mess. Dressing emulsification critical for uniform coating—whisk continuously while drizzling oil. Chill time is flexible; salad can wait 30 minutes to an hour. Retasting is key—salts and acids mute during refrigeration; adjust with small increments of seasoning. Avoid overdressing as liquid pools at bottom and dilutes flavors over time."
tips:
- "Watch corn carefully on the grill. Medium heat keeps smoke mellow. Turn every 2-3 minutes. Charred spots signal done. Avoid overcooking; bursting kernels ruin texture."
- "When prepping veggies, use firm tomatoes. Juicy and colorful ones pop. Cucumbers? Select crisp seedless types. Peel if bitter, cuts down excess moisture."
- "Dressings need balance. Whisk lemon zest, juice, vinegar, maple syrup. Drizzle olive oil while whisking. It emulsifies. A well-mixed dressing coats without pooling."
- "Chill the salad at least 30 minutes. Flavors meld during resting. Before serving, taste. Salt and acidity often fade, adjust accordingly for brightness."
- "Cleaning up? Soak the cutting board and knife ASAP. Corn bits dry onto surfaces. Much easier to clean if handled right away. Save time and elbow grease."
