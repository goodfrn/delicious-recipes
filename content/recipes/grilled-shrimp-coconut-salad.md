slug: "grilled-shrimp-coconut-salad"
description: "Grilled shrimp marinated briefly in a balanced mix of lime and a touch of honey for gentle sweetness. Crisp romaine leaves halved and dressed in a creamy coconut milk vinaigrette brightened with ginger and lime juice. Mango swapped for ripe papaya offering sweetness and a subtly different texture. Sprouts changed to thinly sliced snap peas for crunch and mild flavor. Onion soaking in cold water with rice vinegar instead of lemon to mellow sharpness. Grilling shrimp over high heat gives that sizzle and smoky aroma; key is watching their color change to opaque with pink highlights. Mixing wet and dry ingredients separately before tossing saves texture and flavor integrity."

ingredients:
- "=== Coconut Milk Vinaigrette ==="
- "240 ml (1 cup) full-fat coconut milk"
- "25 ml (1 ¾ tbsp) fresh lime juice"
- "35 ml (2 ½ tbsp) fresh orange juice"
- "10 ml (2 tsp) freshly grated ginger"
- "Salt and black pepper to taste"
- "=== Salad ==="
- "1 small red onion, thinly sliced"
- "2 romaine lettuce hearts, halved lengthwise"
- "1 small papaya, peeled and diced"
- "75 g (1 cup) snap peas, thinly sliced"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) fresh cilantro leaves"
- "10 ml (2 tsp) rice vinegar"
- "=== Shrimp ==="
- "400 g (about 14 oz) large shrimp, deveined with shell"
- "25 ml (1 ½ tbsp) vegetable oil"
- "20 ml (4 tsp) fresh lime juice"
- "10 ml (2 tsp) honey"
- "2 garlic cloves, minced"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "=== Onion Prep ==="
- "1 Soak thinly sliced onion in cold water mixed with rice vinegar instead of lemon. This cuts sharpness without losing crunch. Drain right before serving so it stays fresh and crisp."
- "=== Vinaigrette ==="
- "2 Whisk coconut milk with lime and orange juice adding grated ginger last. Salt and pepper robustly. Ginger adds a sharp aromatic lift preventing one-note flavors Often omitted but essential for balance here."
- "=== Shrimp Marinade ==="
- "3 Combine oil, lime juice, honey, and garlic in mixing bowl. Toss shrimp well, season with salt and pepper. Let it sit 7 to 10 minutes max — too long makes texture mushy."
- "=== Grill Setup ==="
- "4 Preheat grill on high heat. Oil the rack to stop sticking (brush with oil on a paper towel and wipe grill). Use tongs to test heat – hot enough if it sizzles vigorously. Position shrimp directly over flame."
- "=== Cooking Shrimp ==="
- "5 Slide shrimp on grill. Cook 3-4 minutes until shell turns pink and flesh opaque with slight firmness. Flip once fast with tongs to avoid breaking. Shell should have charred hints, shrimps plump from heat but springy. Overcooking makes them rubbery and flavor flat."
- "=== Assembly ==="
- "6 Layer lettuce halves on plates cut side up. Drizzle half the coconut vinaigrette over leaves. Scatter papaya cubes, snap peas, cilantro leaves, and drained onion slices. Lay grilled shrimp along side or on top."
- "7 Serve remaining vinaigrette on the side for spooning or dipping."
- "=== Optional tweaks and notes ==="
- "Lime juice can replace orange if more acidity desired. Snap peas add crunchy sweetness; replace with mung bean sprouts for earthier tone but less crunch. Honey softens harsh lime, maple syrup works in pinch but changes flavor slightly. If no grill available, broil shrimp 4-5 minutes watching closely, turning halfway. Key is color and firmness cues, not strict timing."
- "This is straightforward, minimal components but every element intentional. Acid balances fat from coconut, fresh herbs pop. Don’t skip onion soaking – eliminates harsh sulfur notes that ruin salad brightness. Grill on high for caramelization, not cooking through with smoke."
- "Keep dressing separate until serving prevents lettuce sogginess; toss or spoon on plates. Shrimp marinade short to not pre-cook or saturate carbs in shell. Use fresh lime juice rather than bottled – obvious impact. Watch shrimp carefully, they flip fast and finish quickly."
introduction: "Grilling shrimp with quick marinade—avoid over marinating or you lose texture. Shell left on locks in moisture, gives subtle smoky char. Coconut milk vinaigrette thicker than usual vinaigrettes; ginger punch cuts richness. Swap out mango for papaya, throws in mellow tropical tone. Instead of mung bean sprouts, snap peas bring fresh snap, brighter bite. Onion gets tamed with rice vinegar soak, not lemon; raw onion’s harsh bite kills brightness if not handled properly. Grill needs high heat; you want that audible sizzle, shrimp puckering slight but still juicy inside. Toss vinaigrette just before serving to keep lettuce crisp—wet leaves ruin mouthfeel fast. Balance here is key—don’t overdo sweetness or acidity. Keep components separate till assembly for freshness and crunch."
ingredientsNote: "Coconut milk here is full-fat for creaminess—thin versions won’t bind dressing properly. Freshly grated ginger adds vibrancy, shortcuts include ginger paste but dampens sharpness. Lime and orange juices give layered acidity; replace orange with more lime if you prefer brighter sharper profile. Papaya replaces mango, slightly less sweet, adds smooth texture contrast. Snap peas substituted for bean sprouts, adding a crisp bite and subtle vegetal notes. Onion soaking in vinegar water keeps the sharp edges down without softening too much, key for layering bright flavors without pungent aftertaste. Shrimp marinade time short — any longer and acid starts cooking the flesh, ruining texture. Shell on for grilling locks in moisture but peel after if preferred."
instructionsNote: "Soaking onions in lightly acidic cold water is underrated — it tones down aggressive sulfur compounds without killing crunch, don’t skip. Marinate shrimp max 10 min; longer turns shrimp mushy due to acid. Grill on preheated high heat ‘til you hear steady sizzle—shrimp start turning pink and opaque but still springy when pressed. Flip once only to avoid breakage. Vinaigrette whisked separately prevents separation; ginger last keeps it aromatic. Assembly order matters: lettuce halves first, vinaigrette second so dressing clings but leaves stay crisp, then papaya, snap peas, cilantro scattered with onion on top adds layered texture and bursts of freshness. Serve extra vinaigrette alongside for those who want a bit more tang. If no grill, broiler or hot pan is substitute; watch shrimp carefully to avoid overcooking. Learn to judge doneness by texture and color, not exact minutes; every grill differs. Keep components separate until serving to avoid sogginess in greens."
tips:
- "Watch shrimp closely while grilling. They turn opaque quickly. Shell should sizzle and be firm. Flipping only once prevents breaking."
- "For a more vibrant flavor, use fresh lime juice over bottled. Brighter taste can make a difference; balance between sweet and acidic."
- "Snap peas add crunch but consider alternatives. Mung bean sprouts will work, if you prefer soft textures. Adjust for freshness; keep it light."
- "If using broiler instead of grill, pay attention. Broil shrimp 4-5 minutes, turn once. Shrimp can overcook fast if not checked constantly."
- "Onion soak is key. Vinegar mellows raw sharpness. Don't skip this. Crunch remains, but harsh flavors diminish, bright salad needed."
faq:
- "q: Can I use shrimp with shells off? a: Yes but keep moisture. Shell on traps juices. But peeled shrimp can work. Try not to overmarinate."
- "q: What can I substitute for papaya? a: Ripe mango is sweet option instead. Texture different but still satisfying. Consider adding additional crunch."
- "q: How to tell shrimp are done? a: Color change is crucial. Opaque and pink hints signal readiness. Firm but springy; check undercooked."
- "q: Storing leftover salad? a: Keep components separate. Store vinaigrette in jar, salad greens dry. Mixed salads lose crunch fast; reassembly needed."
