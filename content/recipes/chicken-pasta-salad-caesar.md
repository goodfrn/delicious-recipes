slug: "chicken-pasta-salad-caesar"
description: "A grilled chicken and pasta salad riff on Caesar that trades classic anchovy paste for smoked chile paste, swapping farfalle for gemelli pasta for better sauce cling. Crisp bacon replaced by pancetta for a richer touch. The homemade mayo uses preserved lemon juice instead of fresh lemon for a subtler zing. Lettuce is romaine shredded thin for texture contrast. Cook pasta al dente, chill quickly to stop carryover cooking. Grilled chicken sliced into strips, tossed with a creamy, tangy dressing blending mustard, capers, and smoked chile paste. Parmesan shaved at the end adds sharp saltiness. A practical, textural mix with a smoky hint and clean brightness."

ingredients:
- "=== Salad ==="
- "2 skinless chicken thighs, trimmed"
- "250 g gemelli pasta"
- "1 head romaine lettuce, thinly shredded"
- "100 g pancetta, diced and crisped"
- "100 ml Parmigiano-Reggiano, shaved"
- "=== Mayonnaise Dressing ==="
- "25 ml preserved lemon juice"
- "20 ml capers, finely chopped"
- "1 egg yolk"
- "5 ml smoked chile paste"
- "5 ml Dijon mustard"
- "1 garlic clove, minced"
- "110 ml grapeseed oil"
- "Salt and black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "=== Salad ==="
- "1 Start by heating the grill hot. Get that metal grates hot and oiled; prevents sticking and gives marks. Using thighs instead of breasts means juicier meat but watch flare-ups. Grill about 12-15 minutes, flip halfway. Internal temp solid indicator—75°C or juices run clear. Let rest on cutting board covered loosely with foil to redistribute juices. Resting critical—don’t rush, meat fibers relax. Slice into strips about thumb-width. Set aside, keep warm if serving immediately or chill shortly if later."
- "2 Boil water vigorously with a good pinch salt before adding pasta—salt seasons pasta, not the sauce. Add gemelli pasta. Gemelli holds dressing better than farfalle, slightly chewy bite. Check package but taste a minute or two before suggested time; pasta must remain al dente, firm but not hard. Drain quickly and rinse with cold water to stop cooking and cool swiftly. Toss with a drizzle of oil to prevent sticking."
- "3 Fry pancetta diced in a dry skillet until crisp, rendered fat bubbles, golden and fragrant, takes about 5-7 minutes. Watch carefully; pancetta can burn quickly—shiny fat and firm edges good sign. Drain on paper towels. Save a little fat to flavor the salad if desired."
- "=== Mayonnaise Dressing ==="
- "4 In a bowl or food processor, combine egg yolk, preserved lemon juice, capers, smoked chile paste, Dijon mustard, and garlic. Emulsify slowly by adding grapeseed oil in a thin stream while whisking vigorously or blending. Look for thick, creamy texture. Season with salt and pepper carefully—dressing intensifies once chilled."
- "5 Toss cooled pasta with shredded romaine, chicken strips, and about two-thirds of the dressing. Fold gently; avoid breaking pasta or bruising lettuce. Keep some dressing aside—you may want to add more once plated."
- "6 Plate the salad, sprinkle pancetta crisp, and finish with generous Parmigiano-Reggiano shavings. Last-minute grating key for aroma and flavor punch."
- "7 Taste test for salt, acidity, and heat from chile paste—adjust if needed. Serve chilled or slightly cool."
- "Tips: If no preserved lemon, substitute with fresh lemon zest and a pinch of salt for complexity. Grapeseed oil preferred here for neutral flavor; olive oil can overpower. Use fresh garlic to prevent bitterness. Chicken thighs offer more forgiving grilling than breasts but monitor carefully to avoid dryness."
introduction: "Grilling chicken thighs instead of breasts keeps things juicy, but don’t get cocky—resting meat essential to avoid dry, tough strips. Gemelli pasta twists around the creamy dressing better than farfalle’s flat wings. Capers chopped fine bring briny brightness matched by sharp parm shaved fresh. Switched fresh lemon juice with preserved lemon juice for a mellow citrus note that’s less punchy but more complex. Pancetta sub for bacon ups richness and texture. Homemade mayo with smoked chile paste lifts the dressing beyond typical Caesar. Chill pasta fast to hold al dente grind. Toss gently—no mush here. Use taste, not timers."
ingredientsNote: "Chicken thighs instead of breasts give moisture but cook carefully on the grill; look for firm texture and clear juices not pink. Gemelli pasta traps creamy sauces well; if unavailable, try cavatappi or fusilli. Pancetta crisped fat adds umami stand-in if bacon not handy. Preserved lemon juice adds mellow acidity with subtle fermented notes; replace with fresh lemon zest plus a pinch of salt if needed. For oil, grapeseed preferred to avoid overpowering dressing, but light olive oil acceptable. Smoked chile paste replaces anchovy paste, providing smoky umami with a gentle heat, not overbearing fishiness. Adjust garlic finely minced to avoid bitterness. Parmesan shaved instead of grated gives bursts of nuttiness and delicate salty crunch."
instructionsNote: "Grill chicken thighs on well-oiled grate for 12-15 minutes, flip once; no poking needed. Let rest under loose tented foil to preserve juices—critical for tender bites. Cook pasta in boiling salted water until firm but tender; taste is better than timer. Immediately drain and run under cold water to halt cooking and prevent clumping. Toss pasta lightly with oil before chilling. For mayo, slow drizzle oil into mustard-lemon-capers-garlic-egg yolk mixture with whisking or food processor running—emulsification matters for texture and mouthfeel. Fold salad components gently to preserve textures; avoid over-mixing that bruises lettuce or breaks pasta. Add pancetta at last for crispness and parmesan shaved fresh right before serving for maximum aroma. Taste throughout; salt and acidity levels will shift after chilling. Don’t skimp on resting times or chilling steps; they transform texture and meld flavors properly."
tips:
- "Use thighs instead of breasts. Juicier, flavorful meat. Monitor temp—juice must run clear. Rest covered with foil. Helps keep it tender."
- "Boil water with salt before adding gemelli. Seasoning matters. Al dente means firm but not hard. Quick rinse under cold water—stop cooking."
- "For mayo, emulsify oil slowly. Whisk or blend. Right texture is thick, creamy. Salt and pepper afterwards—flavors develop when chilled."
- "Toss salad gently. Don’t overmix. Preserve textures of lettuce and pasta. Keep dressing back—add if needed later for freshness."
- "Pancetta brings richness. Can sub bacon but watch timing. Cook until crisp and golden. Drain off excess fat; helps prevent sogginess."
faq:
- "q: Can I use chicken breasts? a: Yes, but monitor. Watch for dryness; they cook quicker. Thighs are more forgiving on the grill."
- "q: What if I can't find gemelli? a: Substitute cavatappi or fusilli. Both cling well to dressings. Texture plays a role."
- "q: How long will leftovers last? a: About 2-3 days in fridge. Store in airtight container. Use for quick lunches—flavors meld even better."
- "q: What if I can't find preserved lemons? a: Fresh lemon zest with pinch of salt works. Adds brightness. Still needs a bit of acidity."
