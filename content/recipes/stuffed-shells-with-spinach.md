- "2 cloves garlic minced"
- "25 ml tomato paste"
- "1 can 400 ml diced tomatoes"
- "180 ml vegetable stock plus extra if needed"
- "15 ml chopped fresh basil"
- "5 ml chopped fresh oregano"
- "salt and black pepper to taste"
- "=== Filling and shells ==="
- "24 jumbo pasta shells"
- "280 g fresh baby spinach"
- "15 ml olive oil"
- "450 g ricotta cheese"
- "80 g grated pecorino romano cheese plus extra for topping"
- "pinch ground nutmeg"
- "freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "=== Sauce preparation ==="
- "Place oven rack midlevel. Preheat oven to 240 Celsius. On lined baking sheet, coat pepper halves with 10 ml olive oil, skin side up. Roast about 30 minutes until charred and soft but not collapsed. Remove immediately into covered container or bowl with foil to steam 10 minutes, skin loosens. Peel off skins carefully, discard skins. Reduce oven to 175 Celsius."
- "Meanwhile, heat remaining 15 ml olive oil in saucepan over medium. Sweat onions until translucent, edges soft but no browning, about 6-8 minutes. Add garlic and tomato paste, stir one minute to cook raw taste out, don’t let darken."
- "Pour in canned tomatoes and vegetable stock, bring to gentle boil, simmer uncovered turning sauce frequently until thickened, roughly 9-12 minutes. Watch for bubbling and wait for sauce to coat spoon thickly."
- "Add roasted pepper flesh, basil, oregano. Puree with immersion blender until completely smooth. If too thick, thin with extra broth one tablespoon at a time. Season with salt and pepper. Spread sauce in casserole dish about 33 x 23 cm."
- "=== Filling and shells ==="
- "Cook pasta shells in large pot of well-salted boiling water until just al dente, firm to bite but fully hydrated, about 11-13 minutes. Drain on clean kitchen towel to avoid moisture clinging."
- "Meanwhile, in skillet, warm oil over medium heat. Add spinach in batches, gently wilt until leaves release moisture and reduce drastically in volume. Transfer to sieve and press with back of spoon or hands to squeeze out liquid. Finely chop cooled spinach to avoid bulky lumps."
- "In mixing bowl, combine ricotta, chopped spinach, pecorino romano, nutmeg, fresh black pepper. No salt yet; cheese will add saltiness. Mix thoroughly until consistent but don’t overwork or it becomes dense."
- "Spoon about 25 ml filling into each shell so they’re plump but not bursting. Nestle shells open side up evenly over sauce. Sprinkle reserved cheese on top."
- "Cover tightly with foil. At this point, plate can be refrigerated for up to overnight; bring to room temperature before baking."
- "Bake covered for 22-27 minutes, sauce bubbling around edges. Remove foil and switch oven to broil. Place dish under broiler 3-5 minutes, watch closely for golden brown bubbly cheese, don’t let burn."
- "Remove, rest 5 minutes before serving to settle sauce. Serve with crusty bread or simple salad."
- "=== Tips and substitutions ==="
- "Bell peppers easily swapped for roasted red pepper jarred if short on time but fresh roasting gives deeper flavor and texture."
- "Ricotta can be replaced with low-fat cottage cheese blended smooth or mascarpone for richer mouthfeel."
- "Oregano adds herbal complexity; basil alone can be used but oregano’s earthiness balances sweetness of peppers."
- "Avoid watery filling by squeezing spinach well; excess water ruins texture and dilutes sauce."
- "Using pasta towel dries shells quickly and prevents sauces becoming soupy."
- "Broiling at end crucial for attractive golden cheese crust with crisp edges."
- "If no immersion blender, use regular blender carefully in batches, watch hot sauce safety."
introduction: "Start on roasting those peppers right up. Their skin blackens, crackles, deepens, signals flavor building in progress. Peel off the skins once cooled; slippery, soft flesh waits. That sweet smokiness pulses through the sauce, the base for your shells to luxuriate in. Onions sweat gently, translucent so they melt into sauce, garlic joins in briefly—no bitterness. Tomato paste fuses it all, deepening color and taste. Chopped herbs add fresh greenness. Spinach demands precise handling—wilt, squeeze, chop till nothing more than moist green threads remain. The cheese blend? Ricotta for cream, pecorino for sharpness. Spoon filling carefully—too much and shells burst, too little and dryness sneaks in. Bake covered under foil, steam does the work. End with broil—golden, bubbly, tempting. Technique, timing, and texture balanced perfectly. Every step matters; shortcuts cost in flavor or consistency."
ingredientsNote: "Roasting fresh peppers is non-negotiable unless seriously tight on time—store-bought jars pale in comparison, often watery and one-dimensional. A hand blender or immersion blender is invaluable here; a regular blender can risk spilling hot sauce and burns. Spinach must be squeezed with intent—untreated, it drowns the filling and sauce; a sieve and your hands work best. Ricotta’s subtle sweetness counters the sharper pecorino romano, but cottage cheese can split or watery. Nutmeg provides warmth hidden under the savory umbrella; omit it and the filling flattens. Fresh herbs matter—dried herbs dryness dulls brightness. Pasta shells must be jumbo and al dente, no exceptions—overcooked shells soggy and fragile, undercooked tough. Think ahead; filling assembled earlier tastes better as flavors marry. Season incrementally; cheese contributes salt. Keep a little extra broth for thinning sauce."
instructionsNote: "Roasting the peppers till blackened returns a smoky depth. Keep an eye the final 5 minutes so they don’t collapse to mush, still some firmness and slight caramelization is desired. The steam trap in the covered container loosens skin for easy peeling. Pay attention to onions during sweating—too fast brings browning and bitterness. The tomato paste must cook out rawness; stirring prevents it sticking or burning. Simmer sauce gently; thick enough to coat a spoon but not dry. Blending ensures no chunks spoil mouthfeel; texture matters. When cooking pasta, salt heavily to flavor pasta through. Dry shells on a clean towel prevents watery filling. Spinach squeezing is key—press firmly multiple times. Mix filling gently but thoroughly; overmixing fat leads to dense filling. Bake covered to retain moisture, foil prevents drying out but trap steam for softness. Broil at the end encourages Maillard browning over cheese, watch carefully to avoid scorching. Letting bake rest allows sauce to stabilize and flavors settle; rushing leads to runny sauce. Keep hands wet when filling shells to prevent sticking spoon."
tips:
- "Roast those bell peppers long enough—skin blackened but not mush. Steam after. Peel skin, keep flesh intact. Deeper flavor comes with those charred edges."
- "Drain spinach well. Squeeze multiple times, avoid watery mess. Finely chop after wilting. Gets rid of bulky lumps. No moisture invited."
- "Chopping garlic? Let it sit for a few minutes after mincing. Enzymes develop, transforming flavor. Gentle, mild, not raw taste."
- "Pasta shells need to be jumbo and al dente. Cook firm so filling stays intact. Too soft? They’ll break. Keep an eye on timers."
- "Broiling at the end? Key to those bubbling, golden tops. Watch closely, don't walk away. A minute too long can turn to ash."
- "Using substitution? Cottage cheese can be used but not too watery. Mascarpone adds richness but alters flavor. Test ratios before committing."
faq:
- "q: How to choose pasta shells? a: Look for jumbo size; makes filling easier. Check package. Fresh or dried, both work, but adjust cook times."
- "q: Can I prep ahead? a: Yes, filling can be made day prior. Store in fridge. Assemble shells before baking, just adjust bake time if cold."
- "q: What if sauce is too thick? a: Just add broth, one tablespoon at a time unless heavy. Stir, help it come together smoothly."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Use airtight containers in fridge, up to 3 days. Freezing? Just cool, transfer to freezer-safe container. Great option."
