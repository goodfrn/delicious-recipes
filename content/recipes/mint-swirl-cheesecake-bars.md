ingredients:
- "2 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs"
- "9 tablespoons unsalted butter melted"
- "1 tablespoon brown sugar"
- "24 ounces cream cheese softened and cubed"
- "3/4 cup packed brown sugar"
- "1 teaspoon peppermint extract"
- "1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt"
- "1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom"
- "3 large eggs"
- "a few drops green food coloring"
- "finely grated lime zest from 1 lime"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 355°F. Spray a 9x13 pan lightly with oil or butter. Set aside."
- "Combine graham crumbs, melted butter and 1 tablespoon brown sugar until sandy but moist. Press evenly into bottom of pan. No gaps. Let rest while you make batter."
- "Use stand mixer fitted with paddle or electric hand mixer. Beat cream cheese and brown sugar on medium speed until creamy and almost puffed, about 3 minutes. Scrape sides. Don’t rush this."
- "Add lime zest, peppermint extract, Greek yogurt, and cardamom. Mix just to combine. Overmixing aerates too much."
- "Add eggs one at a time. Blend well but avoid whipping air in, no foamy texture. Batter should be thick and velvety."
- "Divide batter in half. Leave half plain. Add green coloring to other half until pale minty green. Don’t go dark—faint color is key."
- "Spoon plain batter onto graham crust, spread gently and evenly with an offset spatula. Then carefully layer green batter over white, spread slowly to avoid mixing."
- "Set a large roasting pan on rack. Pour about 1 inch of hot water in it. Place cheesecake pan in water bath carefully to center of roasting pan. Water bath prevents drying and cracking - no joke."
- "Bake about 40-45 minutes. The center will feel very lightly set but still jiggle slightly. Edges will be firm, pale golden. If top browns early, shield loosely with foil."
- "Remove from oven. Let cool room temp 30 minutes. Then refrigerate at least 6 hours or overnight. Bars firm up beautifully cold."
- "To cut bars, dip a sharp long knife into hot water, wipe dry. Slice with slow steady pressure. Re-dip knife between cuts if needed. Store wrapped in fridge."
introduction: "Half vanilla creamy, half minty green swirl. Cheesecake bars with a base that snaps but crumbles just right. Using lime zest and cardamom for a subtler complexity instead of just straight peppermint. Brown sugar adds warmth and depth to crust and batter. Don’t skip the water bath or you’ll get dryness, cracks, and ugly baked edges. Wait for the jiggle before pulling from oven. The fridge overnight does wonders for texture firming. A heat-dipped knife slices these clean as a chef’s knife through butter. No overbeaten batter, no cracks. Keeps well and gets better a day later."
ingredientsNote: "Graham cracker crumbs can be swapped for digestive biscuits or vanilla wafer crumbs. Brown sugar instead of plain white ones for a richer buttery note in crust and filling. Butter must be melted but not hot or it’ll alter crust texture. Cream cheese must be room temp and soft for no lumps. Greek yogurt replaces sour cream, easier to find and gives a slight tang and firmness. Peppermint extract can be swapped for pure mint oil but less is more—too strong dries out flavor. Cardamom adds subtle warmth but omit if you prefer pure mint. Food coloring optional but creates that classic mint look. Lime zest brightens flavor without overpowering. Eggs—room temp, added slowly to keep batter tender and dense. No extra flour here: moisture balance is key."
instructionsNote: "Press crust evenly, no gaps. Use paddle attachment or beat slowly with hand mixer to avoid excess air bubbles that crack cheesecake. Cream cheese and sugar first until no grit and fluffy but not whipped to peaks. Add extracts and yogurt carefully to blend, avoid aeration. Eggs last, one by one, blended through but avoid foaming. Divide batter with spatula for even swirl colors. Spread layers gently, don’t mix swirling layers. Water bath mandatory—raises humidity and slows crust cooking so edges don’t dry. Look for a slight jiggle center—it firms while cooling. Shield top with foil if browned too soon. Cool fully at room temp before fridge, prevents shock and cracking. Chill overnight if possible: bars slice cleaner, flavors settle. Hot knife for slicing prevents crumbly, ragged edges. Rinse knife often for clean cuts. Refrigerate covered up to 4 days, or freeze for longer. Let thaw in fridge before slicing if frozen."
tips:
- "Use room temp cream cheese, cubed. Helps avoid lumps—ensures smooth batter. Beat slowly, avoid too much air. Mix until creamy."
- "Don’t skip the water bath. Essential for moisture, prevents cracks. 1 inch of hot water, place in roasting pan. Keeps edges tender."
- "Chill bars overnight. Really firms texture. Slicing clean improves flavor too. Best served cold, let flavors meld. Let cool before refrigerating."
- "When adding food coloring, just a few drops. Too much leads to dark mint that overwhelms. Aim for pale, bright green; visual appeal."
- "Heat knife when slicing. Prevents crumbling. Dip in hot water, wipe clean. Cuts smooth, precision matters for presentation. Re-dip as needed."
faq:
- "q: How to prevent cracks in the cheesecake? a: Water bath is key. Keeps humidity high. Avoid overmixing too. No air bubbles, be gentle."
- "q: Can I use another type of yogurt? a: Greek yogurt gives tang. Other yogurts might alter texture. Look for something thick for best results."
- "q: What's the best way to store leftover bars? a: Wrap in plastic wrap, airtight container. Up to four days in fridge. Freeze for longer shelf life."
- "q: What if I don’t have graham cracker crumbs? a: Digestive biscuits are a good swap. Vanilla wafers work in a pinch. Crush finely for even crust."
