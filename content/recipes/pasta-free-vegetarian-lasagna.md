ingredients:
- "8 medium plum tomatoes cut in halves and seeded"
- "3 cloves garlic minced fine"
- "10 ml dried oregano"
- "70 ml olive oil roughly"
- "150 ml chopped shallots"
- "200 g firm tofu drained and crumbled"
- "200 ml ricotta cheese"
- "200 ml chopped marinated artichokes"
- "Leaves from 1 head romaine lettuce"
- "200 g asparagus trimmed and blanched"
- "300 ml shredded mozzarella"
- "Salt and black pepper to taste"
- "50 ml cooked chopped spinach leaves (substitute for ricotta portion)"
- "15 ml lemon juice (twist for brightness)"
instructions:
- "=== Preparing Tomatoes ==="
- "Set oven rack mid-level and preheat oven at 130 C 265 F to intensify roasting without drying. Line baking sheet with parchment. Toss tomatoes with garlic, oregano, 45 ml olive oil, salt, pepper. Arrange cut side down. Roast about 2 hours 10 minutes until skins blister and detach with minimal tug. Let cool, slip skins with gentle rub. Reserve juices left on parchment."
- "=== Tofu Shallot Mixture ==="
- "Heat remaining 25 ml olive oil over medium heat in skillet. Sweat shallots until translucently soft, about 4 minutes. Add crumbled tofu. Saute stirring often until tofu edges crisp golden, about 5 minutes. Watch for browning smell but no burning. Remove from heat. Allow to cool slightly then fold in half the ricotta plus lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside."
- "=== Artichoke Ricotta Blend ==="
- "Combine chopped artichokes with remaining ricotta and cooked spinach leaves instead of pure ricotta here. Brings moistness and vibrant color. Season. Hold chilled."
- "=== Romaine and Asparagus Ready ==="
- "Bring salted water to rolling boil. Submerge romaine leaves one batch at a time for 1-2 minutes until just wilted but still vivid green. Plunge immediately into ice water to stop cooking, intensify crunch and set color. Drain and pat dry. Blanch asparagus same way but 90 seconds max. Should be tender-firm, bright. Drain well."
- "=== Oven Now at 180 C 355 F ==="
- "=== Assembly ==="
- "Grease or oil a 28x18 cm baking dish lightly for easier release. Spread half the roasted tomatoes and their juice evenly forming a thick layer. Lay a full sheet of romaine leaves covering tomatoes completely to avoid sogginess. Dollop and spread tofu-ricotta mix over that evenly. Cover with another layer of lettuce leaves. Next, scatter asparagus lengthwise, pressing gently. Sprinkle 200 ml mozzarella over asparagus layer. Repeat layering with romaine leaves over mozzarella. Spread artichoke-spinach-ricotta blend evenly over leaves. Cover fully again with lettuce. Top with remaining tomatoes and mozzarella generously. Press down lightly to compact layers without crushing."
- "Transfer dish to preheated oven. Bake 50 minutes, checking at 40 minutes for bubbling edges and cheese browning. Foil tent if cheese browns too fast but inside still cool. Lasagna is ready when heated through, cheese bubbling golden, edges bubbling with a slight crust. Remove from oven, let rest uncovered for 10-15 minutes to set layers and ease slicing."
- "Serve warm. Notes: Lettuce holds layers intact but avoid overcooking or it turns slimy. Proper blanching timing critical. Tofu adds protein and texture; press out excess moisture beforehand for better browning. If no ricotta, substitute with thick Greek yogurt or blended cottage cheese mixed with a bit of lemon zest. Swap artichokes with roasted zucchini strips for variation. Keep olive oil generous during cooking to prevent sticking but not too much to flood layers. Medium heat critical in tofu step avoid sogginess."
- "Common problem: soggy lasagna can mean lettuce overcooked or tomatoes not sufficiently roasted to reduce water. Fix by roasting longer and drying lettuce leaves more thoroughly. Also layering order matters — tomato layer first on bottom absorbs less water into leaves."
introduction: "Forget pasta sheets — using romaine leaves as layers makes this dish lighter but holds everything together with no collapse. The tomatoes roast low and slow until their natural sugars caramelize, and you almost hear the sizzling. Garlic and oregano infuse subtle, rustic tones. Browning tofu adds a nutty bite to offset ricotta's creaminess. Artichokes bring moisture and briny notes; spinach blends in quietly to boost color and nutrition. Blanching greens just right keeps their snap, key to avoiding mush. Mozzarella finishes with that golden, bubbling top cloak — irresistible. Layers stack visually pretty, the kitchen fills with aromas coaxing the day along. Not so simple as just throwing everything in. Technique here matters; attention to timing, heat, water balance or risk a sad soggy slice. But when right, bite through textures unfold in satisfying progression — firm, creamy, fresh, oozy. Make space for resting after baking, layers need to set. Ready to slice with confidence, no sloppy mess. Lean on these tricks and you’ve elevated a humble veggie tray into full meal with umami punch without gluten or pasta fuss."
ingredientsNote: "Roasting tomatoes longer and low avoids watery filling and draws out deeper flavor. Remove seeds and skin carefully to avoid bitterness and over-moisture. Tofu pressed overnight yields a firmer crumb and browns more evenly. Shallots preferred for delicate sweetness but use onions if needed; cook slowly to avoid harsh bite. Using both ricotta and spinach in the artichoke blend adds moisture but helps keep dish cohesive. Romaine leaves can be tricky — always blanch briefly and shock in ice water to maintain texture. Asparagus must retain snap for mouthfeel; don’t overcook. Mozzarella should be freshly shredded for best melt and flavor. Olive oil generous for flavor and to prevent sticking but measured so dish doesn't become greasy. Lemon juice brightens tofu-ricotta mix, cuts richness. If spinach or asparagus unavailable, substitute blanched kale or green beans respectively — watch cooking times. Salt thoughtfully at each stage; under-seasoning is common pitfall."
instructionsNote: "Slow roasting tomatoes crucial, patient here provides intense natural sweetness and prevents watery layers below. Look for bubbling skin, giving easily when pressed. During tofu step, brown in batches if pan crowded; moisture escapes better, browning improves. Use medium heat, stirring often to avoid sticking but allow crust formation. There's slight resistance when tofu is ready, scent nutty, sound of faint sizzling. Blanching romaine and asparagus need vigilance; overdone leaves turn limp, mushy. Test by bending leaf — firm but pliant is goal. Assembly order locks in moisture control: tomato first layer absorbs some juice but doesn't flood leaves; layering lettuce between mixes creates barrier; cheese between veggie layers melts to glue structure. Cheeses measured with eyes — mozzarella not too thin or thick for even melting. Cover loosely with foil mid-bake if top browns too quick compared to centers warming. Rest time post-oven essential; cutting too soon leads to collapsing layers. Use serrated knife, slice gently with a sawing motion to keep intact. If lacking romaine, butter lettuce can substitute with gentler blanching. Keep dish size consistent to maintain layer height and cooking times aligned."
tips:
- "Roast tomatoes longer, low heat. Skin blistering is key. Avoid water by removing seeds; they add bitterness. Smell sweetness fills kitchen. Keep close watch."
- "Tofu pressing matters. Moisture out yields crispy edges. Browning creates texture. Saute shallots first. Sweetness rounds flavor; don’t rush. Stir frequently, avoiding burning."
- "Blanch greens carefully. Romaine needs brief dip. Ice water shock retains color and crisp. Asparagus? 90 seconds max. Too much time equals mush. Firmness is crucial."
- "Layering order matters. Start with tomatoes to soak moisture. Romaine barriers prevent sogginess. Interleave cheese and veggies to bind layers. Eyeball cheeses; thickness matters."
- "Let baked lasagna rest. Cutting too soon results in collapse. A serrated knife helps. Serve warm but wait for layers to settle. Visual appeal matters."
faq:
- "q: Can I use other cheese types? a: Yes, try Greek yogurt if ricotta unavailable. Cottage cheese is an option; add lemon zest for brightness."
- "q: What if my lasagna is soggy? a: Examine tomatoes, under-roasting causes moisture. Blanching too long leads to limp. Adjust future cooking times."
- "q: How long does it last in fridge? a: Up to 3 days if stored covered. Reheat gently. Freezing is possible, just remember to section before freezing."
- "q: Can I substitute romaine? a: Yes, butter lettuce works well. Blanch briefly; maintain texture. Watch timing; too long makes leaves limp."
