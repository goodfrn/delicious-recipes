- "7.5 ml fresh marjoram chopped or dried"
- "Salt and black pepper freshly ground"
- "400 ml sparkling rosé cider"

instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 185 °C 365 °F."
- "Stuff the chicken cavity with leek chunks, one apple quarter and smashed garlic cloves. Rest of apples around bird in roasting pan."
- "Brush melted ghee over skin, sprinkle marjoram generously. Don’t skimp on salt; peppers evenly."
- "Pour cider over apples; add bay leaf to pan not inside chicken."
- "Cooking time flexible around 1h 30 min; test by piercing thickest thigh with skewer. Juice should run clear, skin crisp golden with slight bubbling fat at edges."
- "Remove chicken when juices clear; discard bay leaf before serving."
- "Serve pulled apart with cider-soaked apples and pan drippings; roast potato sides work well."

- "If cider not found, dilute dry rosé wine with sparkling water 70:30."
introduction: "Roast chicken with cider. Not just any cider—rosé sparkling gives bite and sweetness intermixed. Use whole bird about 1.3 kg, trims cook time down, meat cooks evenly. Leek swaps onion for subtler aroma, doesn’t overpower like onion can sometimes do. Makes stuffing inside cavity easy. Apples break down in oven, turn silky-soft, soak cider, become little savory pockets. Garlic smashed—release oils without burning. Butter or ghee coats skin, helps browning, drying out skin for crunch. Marjoram adds floral but earthy herbal notes, thyme is classic but marjoram smooths edges. Bay leaf in pan, not chicken, steeps flavor in cider and apples. Smell of cider roasting blends, sweet and savory, kitchen fills fast. Don’t trust times blindly; juices color is better doneness guide. If juices pink, chicken not ready. Foil shield if skin blacks too soon is fine, no harm. Rosé cider is key—adds freshness and aroma, but common sparkling wine + soda water combo possible. This method was tested by trial and chance. Rustic and forgiving, but precision where it matters."
ingredientsNote: "Adjust chicken size by weighing beforehand. Smaller birds cook faster, larger slower. Leek chosen over standard onion — less sharpness, sweeter notes remain after roasting without bitterness. Gala apples replace Cortland — more balanced sugar-acid. Firm apples hold shape; don’t pick mushy types or they disintegrate completely. Garlic smashed but not minced; avoid tiny pieces that char and turn bitter. Ghee or clarified butter melts better with higher smoke point than plain butter, avoid burning skin early. Marjoram substitutes thyme nicely—both herbs native to temperate climates and store dried for months. Salt entire bird including cavity for seasoning infusions. Sparkling rosé cider is Quebec specialty but if unavailable, use dry rosé combined with sparkling mineral water 70/30 ratio for bubbles and fruit aroma. Bay leaf adds subtle piney undertones, remove before serving to avoid bitterness. Keeps fungus or green mold risks down if leaves old or leaves left in too long. When shopping, get unseasoned chicken; brined or injected often disrupts cooking time and appearance of clear juices."
instructionsNote: "Start stuffing right after preheating oven—less delay warms chicken evenly. Stuffing with aromatics inside cavity concentrates flavors and produces moist interior. Distribute apples around outside so they bathe in cider and roast gently, caramelizing at edges. Butter brushed on skin before herbs is crucial to brown crisply, dry skin, and seal surface to keep moisture inside meat. Marjoram sprinkled before oven evenly browns and permeates during roasting. Pour cider carefully so it sits at base; liquid steams without making skin soggy. Bay leaf slips into pan, never inside; too long inside cavity tastes soapy. Aim for gentle low heat roasting near 180 °C with airflow for consistent cooking. Check chicken around 85 minutes by inserting thin skewer deep into thigh; juices clear means done. Pink or red needs longer—15 min increments. Let rest 10 min after cooking to retain juices before cutting. Remove bay leaf before serving; it’s bitter raw and leathery. Use foil tent if skin over-browning or oven too hot, vents crisp skin when removed in last 10 min. Apples soak up cider and chicken juices; texture softens but shape holds if firm apple chosen. If cider unavailable, dilute rosé wine with soda water; balance acidity and bubbles."
tips:
- "Start stuffing right after preheating; less delay means warm chicken. Helps in even cooking. Don’t leave cavity empty or too stuffed."
- "Keep an eye on the chicken; if juice runs pink, it needs more time. Test every 10-15 minutes. Adjust the oven temp during last bit if skin over-browns."
- "Use firm apples like Gala or McIntosh; mushy apples disintegrate. Apples soak up flavors, adding texture. Garlic should be smashed—burnt bits spoil flavor."
- "Marjoram can be swapped with oregano; thyme works too but less aromatic. Dried herbs included; can adjust according to availability."
- "If not enough cider, mix dry rosé with sparkling water. Maintain bubbly and fruity without cider. Foil over chicken helps with browning if needed."
faq:
- "q: What if chicken cooks too fast? a: Use foil tent to cover chicken, slow browning. Don’t lose heat. Monitor temp, increase if needed."
- "q: What's best way to tell chicken is done? a: Juices should run clear, not pink. Insert skewer at thigh. Not trusting time alone is key."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep sealed in fridge up to 3 days. Can also freeze; just wrap tightly. Monitor for freezer burn."
- "q: Can I substitute for apples? a: Yes, pears work as a decent alternative. Tart cherries offer different flavor; choose fruits that hold shape."
