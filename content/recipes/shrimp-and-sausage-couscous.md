ingredients:
- "1 medium cauliflower head cut into small florets"
- "1 yellow bell pepper deseeded and diced"
- "1 large shallot thinly sliced"
- "3 cloves garlic peeled and halved"
- "75 ml olive oil"
- "4 spiced merguez sausages"
- "400 g peeled raw shrimp"
- "Salt and black pepper"
- "600 ml vegetable broth"
- "450 ml couscous"
- "40 ml chopped fresh cilantro"
- "2 tsp smoked sweet paprika"
- "Olive oil to drizzle"
- "1 fresh lemon cut into wedges"
- "1 tsp cumin seed"
instructions:
- "=== Roasting ==="
- "1. Put oven rack high, preheat to broil setting. Toss cauliflower, yellow pepper, shallot, garlic with olive oil, cumin, salt, and pepper on baking sheet."
- "2. Place merguez sausages nearby on same sheet. Broil about 17 minutes until vegetables have charred edges. Stir halfway."
- "3. Sprinkle shrimp with salt and pepper. Remove sheet. Mix vegetables to expose bottoms, nestle shrimp among them."
- "4. Return to oven, broil another 6 minutes, or until shrimp turn pink and are firm. Cut sausages into bite-size pieces, scatter back on tray."
- "=== Couscous ==="
- "5. Meanwhile, heat vegetable broth until boiling, preferably in microwave-safe bowl. Pour over couscous, cover tightly. Let sit 6 minutes."
- "6. Fluff couscous gently with fork to separate grains."
- "7. Combine couscous with roasted mixture on baking sheet. Add chopped cilantro and smoked paprika. Adjust salt and pepper to taste."
- "8. Drizzle olive oil over all. Mix thorough but gently to keep textures intact."
- "9. Serve with wedges of lemon to squeeze over before eating."
introduction: "Cauliflower not just a side but a base crust here. Mixed colors from yellow pepper and shallot add bite and sweet notes, roasted under broiler for that quick charred crunch. Merguez sausages spiced and smoky, cut then scattered atop. Shrimp tossed in at the end, pink and plump, fully cooked but not overdone. Couscous soaked rather than boiled, fluffy with each grain separate. Cilantro swaps parsley, adds lift. Smoked paprika for smoky warmth in place of just sweet paprika. Cumin seeds bring a deep earthiness birthed from frying in olive oil with the vegetables. Lemon wedges to add sharpness on the side, dripped casually onto the heap."
ingredientsNote: "Cauliflower small florets hold up well under broil, crisp and tender. Yellow bell pepper swapped in for red for slightly sweeter contrast. Shallot instead of onion for subtle onion flavor, less pungent but still aromatic. Cumin seeds dry toasted then added with veggies release oils that infuse the whole tray before roasting. Shrimp quantity cut slightly, better balance with sausage volume. Broth is vegetable for vegetarian-leaning prep, doubling broth ratio for fluffier couscous. Cilantro fresh, chopped after cooking to preserve brightness and herbal notes. Smoked paprika over sweet lends deeper layers over the overall ensemble. Olive oil generous, coats all for caramelized edges without drying."
instructionsNote: "Broiling vegetables and sausage at the top rack allows rapid high heat sear. Stirring midway prevents burning yet retains crispness on all sides. Adding shrimp later avoids overcooking them; they cook fast, five to six minutes enough under direct heat. Sausages cut post initial cook to seal juices but permit easier bite-sized portions on serving. Couscous hydrated by hot broth under cover to absorb liquid fully without over softening. Fork fluffing essential to keep grains distinct. Combining hot veggies and couscous on same tray melds flavors simply and minimizes cleanup. Final drizzle of olive oil prevents dryness and adds sheen. Lemon wedges not squeezed early to keep brightness sharp at service."
tips:
- "Select cauliflower head with tight florets. Break into small pieces. They roast better. Even cooking. Crisp outside, tender inside. Don't overcrowd the pan. This ensures proper broiling."
- "For maximum flavor, add cumin seeds when cooking veggies. Toast them first in hot olive oil. Brings out oils, intensifies taste. For extra kick, adjust the paprika to your preference."
- "Couscous hydration is vital. Pour boiling broth over dry couscous. Cover tightly. Let it sit six minutes. This method keeps grains separate. Fluff gently with a fork afterwards."
- "Mix roasted ingredients with couscous when hot. This allows flavors to meld together. Avoid mashing. Gently combine. Use a spatula. Maintain distinct textures as much as possible."
- "Serving tip: Don't squeeze lemon on all at once. Provides fresher flavor. Allows for individual adjustments. Let diners decide. Juice adds brightness. But keep wedges intact for simple serving."
faq:
- "q: How do I prepare the cauliflower for roasting? a: Cut into small florets. Aim for uniform size. This ensures even roasting. Toss with oil, salt and cumin."
- "q: What can I serve this dish with? a: Think greens, maybe a salad. Also pairs well with crusty bread. Offers a nice contrast to the couscous."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Store in airtight container. Fridge for 2-3 days works fine. Reheat slowly to prevent overcooking the shrimp."
- "q: Can I substitute any ingredients? a: Yes, try chicken sausages. Adjust protein source as needed. Or swap shrimp for tofu for a vegetarian option."
