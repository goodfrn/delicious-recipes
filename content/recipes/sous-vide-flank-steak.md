ingredients:
- "=== Steak ==="
- "400 g flank steak, 2.5 cm thick, halved"
- "1 small rosemary sprig"
- "Pinch kosher salt"
- "Fresh cracked black pepper"
- "=== Garnish ==="
- "1 recipe sous vide rainbow carrots (see below)"
- "½ grilled lemon, cut in half"
- "85 g soft goat cheese with chives, crumbled"
- "Few chopped fresh tarragon leaves, optional"
- "Zest of 1 lemon"
instructions:
- "=== Steak ==="
- "1. Attach precision cooker to a water container. Fill water between min and max markers. Set temp to 56°C for medium rare flank (pushes tenderness without overcook). Start heating water while prepping steak."
- "2. Season steaks liberally with salt and cracked pepper. Place steaks alongside rosemary sprig in sous vide bag or quality zip-lock freezer bag. Remove air with water displacement or vacuum sealer. Submerge bag fully, clip to container edge if needed."
- "3. Cook 1 hour 20 mins. Don’t rush sous vide; low and slow breaks down muscle fibers evenly. Time can be adjusted by 5-10 mins based on thickness; visual texture is key. It should feel tender, not mushy."
- "4. While steak cooks, prepare carrots. Use rainbow carrots – sweeter, earthier, colors vivid on grill. Season simply with butter and salt. Seal and cook sous vide at 85°C for 45 mins."
- "5. Preheat grill to high. Oil grill grates well to prevent sticking. Remove steak and carrots from bags carefully. Pat steak dry for better sear. Grill steak 2-3 mins per side until deep mahogany crust forms with light char. Flip once. Grill carrots alongside for 2-3 mins to get smoky sweetness and grill marks."
- "6. Grill lemon halves cut side down until caramelized spots appear, about 3 mins."
- "7. Remove all, place steak and carrots on plates. Squeeze grilled lemon juice over steak. Dollop goat cheese mixed with lemon zest and chopped tarragon over carrots. Sprinkle extra herbs if desired."
- "8. Serve immediately to enjoy contrasting textures: silky tender flank, crisp grill char, creamy tangy cheese, bright citrus punch."
- "=== Notes ==="
- "- Substitutions: Ribeye or sirloin can substitute flank steak. Adjust time slightly for thickness. If goat cheese unavailable, use cream cheese with herbs but expect less tang."
- "- No vacuum sealer? Use zip-lock bag water displacement method by sealing almost fully, submerging slowly to push air out, then sealing completely."
- "- Watch for flare-ups on grill; mop grate or turn flames down if too hot."
- "- The lemon zest in cheese adds a spark missing from classic fresh cheese."
- "- Rainbow carrots offer roasted earthy notes but any firm, sweet carrot will do."
- "- Avoid over-searing steak; crust raw blackened flavors ruin texture."
- "- If sous vide setup unavailable, cook steak sous vide style in very low oven wrapped airtight but expect less even doneness."
- "- The time of 1 hour 20 mins is a sweet spot for this cut/thickness to reach softness without losing bite."
- "- Rosemary aroma seeps into meat via sous vide, no need to brush on after."
- "- Grilling lemon caramelizes natural sugars; juice less sour and richer flavor."
- "- Rest steak briefly 3-5 mins after grilling to redistribute juices if time allows."
- "- Check carrot tenderness with fork post sous vide before grilling."
- "- The goat cheese herb mix below can be made ahead and chilled."
introduction: "Flank steak sous vide– a method that turns a tougher cut tender and juicy, no guesswork. Hot water bathed at 56°C gently unwinds muscle fibers over 80 minutes. Carrots get a makeover; vibrant rainbow varieties provide a sweeter, more complex backdrop to the meat. Swap in tangy goat cheese laced with lemon zest and tarragon instead of typical fresh cheese. It lifts the plate. Grill caramelized lemons for subtle smoky acidity. Technique? Dry meat post-bag, sear crust fast, avoiding leathery char. Watch color, smell rosemary infuse. Grilling carrots just long enough for crisp edges, tender bite. Real textures. Flavors layered but simple. The result: rustic with finesse, executed with surgical precision."
ingredientsNote: "Choose flank or bavette steak at 2.5 cm thickness for even cooking sous vide. Flank is lean with sinews, benefits hugely from low temp bath to soften. Rosemary adds sharp pine aroma but can swap with thyme or oregano depending on preference. Instead of fresh cheese with échalote and chive, try goat cheese whipped with lemon zest and chopped tarragon for bright herbal punch. Rainbow carrots lend more bite and color, but any carrot firm enough for grilling works. Use kosher salt to season steaks; it penetrates well. Zip-lock bags must be high quality to hold vacuum/sealed air out. Grilling lemon halves instead of just squeezing raw adds smoky sweetness enhancing umami. Keep ingredients fresh; herbs bruised lose aroma quickly. Butter on carrots before vacuum softens them during cooking."
instructionsNote: "Start precision cooker early– water temp stabilization crucial for accurate sous vide results. Pat steaks completely dry before searing; moisture inhibits good crust. Use oil on grill grates, not steak– prevents flare-ups while forming deep crust. Remove meat & carrots from vacuum bags carefully to retain juices inside, but avoid wet surfaces before sear. Cook steak at 56°C; medium rare achieved without gray bands that overcooking renders. Don't trust clock blindly; check by feel– steak should spring back slightly, not be mush. When grilling carrots, watch for light blistering skin but avoid burning. Lemon grilling caramelizes sugars altering flavor; serve warm. Mixing goat cheese with lemon zest and tarragon ahead allows flavors to meld; set aside chilled until plating. Rest steak briefly post-grill to redistribute juices for maximum tenderness. If no sous vide gear, slow oven cook wrapped tightly at low heat can work but less controlled. Always prioritize sensory cues– aroma, crust color, carrot tenderness over exact timing for best results."
tips:
- "Start sous vide process before chopping steak. Uses low temp to break down fibers, get tenderness. Watch meat, avoid mush. Sear like pro."
- "Use high quality zip-lock bags for sous vide. Push out air carefully. Replace steak if you see tears on bag. No leaks; water in bag ruins everything."
- "For grilled carrots, choose firm rainbow varieties. Sweet, dangerous to burn. Grill for right amount of time. Too long and they’re mushy. Watch for char."
- "Goat cheese adds tang. If unavailable, cream cheese is backup. Mix in herbs for flavor but expect different taste. Goat cheese melts into steak juices."
- "Quickly pat steak dry before grilling. Moisture prevents good crust. Oil grill grates too. Prevents sticking, flames get out of control. Smoky is key."
faq:
- "q: Can I use a different cut? a: Sure, ribeye works well, similar cook times. Adjust thickness. Don't rush it. Watch texture instead of clock."
- "q: What if I don't have rainbow carrots? a: Use any firm carrot. Avoid soft ones, grilling not easy. Standard orange ones work, but flavor different."
- "q: How do I know steak is done? a: Look for deep mahogany crust, spring back to touch. Use feel, not just time. Must avoid over-searing."
- "q: How should I store leftovers? a: Keep in airtight container. Refrigerate up to three days. Reheat gently in low oven. Avoid microwave if possible."
