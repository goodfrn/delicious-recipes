ingredients:
- "220 g rolled puff pastry dough"
- "3 medium leeks around 180 g total"
- "20 ml olive oil"
- "140 g Reblochon cheese, thinly sliced"
- "2 medium apples, cored and cut into thin wedges"
- "20 ml maple syrup"
- "25 ml toasted walnut pieces"
- "Salt"
- "Freshly cracked black pepper"
- "Pink peppercorns crushed"
instructions:
- "Line a baking tray with parchment paper."
- "Roll puff pastry to a rough 27 cm diameter circle. Fold edges under to form a rim; chill 25-30 minutes to avoid shrinkage during baking."
- "Trim leeks to 20 cm lengths. Slice in half lengthwise stopping 2 cm from root end to keep halves intact. Rinse thoroughly to extract grit."
- "Blanch leeks in boiling salted water till tender but firm, 6-7 minutes. Shock in ice water immediately to halt cooking. Drain on paper towels, pat dry, then trim roots off."
- "Preheat oven to 185°C placing rack in lower third to avoid pastry over-browning before filling melts."
- "Dock pastry base all over, avoiding edges, so steam escapes and prevents sogginess. Brush with olive oil to create moisture barrier and intensify browning."
- "Scatter Reblochon slices thinly over base. Lay blanched leeks radially from center forming spokes. Fill gaps with apple wedges – no overlap, keeps base crisp."
- "Drizzle maple syrup evenly over top. Scatter toasted walnuts and season liberally with salt, cracked black pepper, and crushed pink peppercorns for spice note."
- "Bake 42-45 minutes until pastry golden and puffed; cheese melted and starting to bubble. Apples should soften but hold shape; leeks deeply fragrant."
- "Rest 10 minutes outside oven to let filling settle and juices thicken, easier slicing."
introduction: "Puff pastry tricks: roll larger, fold edges tight, chill—prevents shrinkage and soggy crust. Leeks need grit washing, splitting them lengthwise but leaving root intact holds halves together during blanching; prevents falling apart in assembly. Apple slices add crunch and juiciness—pick firm varieties like Honeycrisp or Pink Lady, thin for even cooking under brooding cheese crust. Replacing Camembert with Reblochon delivers more robust dairy flavor that melts into rich silk. Toasted walnuts swap pine nuts for earthier crunch, easier to find and hold shape better when baked. Maple syrup adds complex sweetness. Pink peppercorns crack one notch above regular pepper—bright, biting pop. Timing’s a guide; watch texture and aroma carefully. Browned pastry edges, bubbling cheese, the scent of toasted nuts—know when it’s done by senses, not timer."
ingredientsNote: "Puff pastry can be store-bought or homemade. If dough shrinks excessively while baking, ensure edges are chilled well and dough rested before baking. Using Reblochon cheese instead of Camembert adds a nuttier depth, but Brie or Taleggio are acceptable swaps. Apples suit tart, firm types like Granny Smith or Pink Lady; pears are an alternative but release more juice, risking soggy crust. Walnuts toasted in dry pan for 3-4 minutes reveal oils and crunch, substitute pecans or hazelnuts if preferred—skip nuts altogether if allergies. Olive oil helps create crisp bottom; some prefer melted butter but can burn easily. Maple syrup replaces honey for subtler sweetness but could be swapped back if unavailable. Pink peppercorns optional—black pepper or lemon zest add brightness if you skip them."
instructionsNote: "Docking the pastry base keeps steam from puffing the center too much, avoids a doughy middle with an uneven bake. Folding edges under creates a thicker border that holds filling and crisps nicely without burning. Chill dough after shaping to relax gluten, prevent springback. Blanching leeks softens but keeps structure—shock in ice water immediately to preserve color and stop cooking. Pat very dry to avoid sogginess. Placing rack low in oven hinders top over-browning while bottom crisps fully. Spoon on olive oil before cheese to barrier moisture, intensify golden color. Arrange filling carefully so heat distributes evenly. Baking times fluctuate with oven and dough thickness; look for bubbling cheese, puffed edges, golden crust. Resting slice 10 minutes allows filling juices to thicken slightly, making clean cuts possible. If lacking time for blanching, sautéing leeks gently can work but risks uneven texture. Watch over apple slices for moisture release—too thick or juicy slices can sog crust. Use convection if available but reduce temp slightly to avoid rapid browning."
tips:
- "Roll that pastry out. Bigger is better. Chill edges. Helps avoid shrinkage during baking. Edges are the crust’s strength."
- "Leeks need grit washing. Don’t skip. Cut in half but leave root. Keeps them together. Blanch, ice shock—color matters."
- "Apple choice impacts texture. Firm varieties work best. Honeycrisp, pink lady hold shape. Cut thin. Less moisture release."
- "Bubbling cheese: focus on texture and scent. Look for puffed edges and golden crust. Timing varies; ovens differ. Watch closely."
- "Toasting walnuts is key. Brings out crunch, flavor. Just 3-4 minutes in a dry pan. Replace with pecans if desired."
faq:
- "q: What's the best way to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate, airtight. Reheat in oven to crisp again. Don't microwave, soggy risks."
- "q: What if my pastry shrinks? a: Ensure edges chilled. Rest dough before rolling. Overworking makes it tough too."
- "q: Can I skip blanching leeks? a: You could sauté gently. Less even texture risk though. Blanch keeps colors vibrant."
- "q: Alternatives for Reblochon? a: Brie or Taleggio work. Both melt well. Richness varies, but adds unique flavor notes."
