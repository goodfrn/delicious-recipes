ingredients:
- "100 ml plain Greek yogurt 2% or strained natural yogurt"
- "2 tablespoons fresh lime juice (about 30 ml)"
- "1 small ripe avocado peeled and chopped"
- "1 medium scallion chopped"
- "25 g (1 cup) kale leaves packed, torn"
- "10 g (1/4 cup) fresh cilantro leaves"
- "2 tablespoons fresh parsley leaves or substitute with dill"
- "15-30 ml cold water to thin (1 to 2 tablespoons)"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Rinse herbs and kale well; pat dry. Rough chop kale, herb leaves, scallion, avocado."
- "Place avocado chunks and yogurt in a blender or food processor bowl. Start blending on medium."
- "Add lime juice gradually. Notice the creamy texture—thick but easy to scrape down sides."
- "Add kale and herbs; pulse then blend. Watch color shift to bright green and texture thicken."
- "Stop blender, scrape sides with rubber spatula. Assess thickness."
- "Add cold water slowly, 1 tablespoon at a time, blending between additions until dressing reaches pourable consistency but still has body."
- "Season with salt and pepper. Blend briefly just to mix."
- "Taste test. Lime acidity, salt balance critical. Adjust if too thick or bland."
- "Transfer to airtight container. Cold storage slows green discoloration but slight darkening normal."
- "Use within 4 days. Discard if odor or color shifts drastically."
introduction: "Cut corners with store-bought? Skip it. Blend fresh herbs, creamy avocado, and yogurt yourself. No mayo needed. The juice of lime, sharp and bright, wakes up the greenery. Kale over arugula here; sturdier leaves, more vegetal depth, better punch through creaminess. Cilantro swaps mint for a warm earthy undertone, less bright but more robust. Parsley adds freshness where dill can give a prickly edge. Texture matters—too thick? Water trickle in, each spoonful counted. Too thin? Hold back. No lumps or weird chunks tolerated. Keep an eye on color, subtle darkening happens in fridge but green should stay alive. Salting is key—draws out flavor, cuts avocado heaviness. Count on this as a dip, drizzled over greens, or dolloped on grilled meats. No fuss but watch your blender’s rhythm. Too long and warm? Flavor dulls. Stop early, scrape down, finish with short pulses. This isn’t a dump-and-go situation. You earn the difference."
ingredientsNote: "Ingredients are straightforward—Greek yogurt for tang and body, ripe avocado for creaminess and fat, fresh lime for acid balance. Kale chosen for texture and flavor instead of peppery arugula; tough but vibrant green, helps hold dressing together without losing vibrance. Cilantro replaces mint—warmer, slightly pungent flavor. Parsley adds subtle freshness, and scallion offers onion sharpness without harshness. Cold water added to loosen dressing prevents separation, especially since no oil included here. Use ripe avocado—soft, creamy but not mushy; brown spots okay but avoid bitterness. Greek yogurt 2% preferred; low-fat yogurt waters down, full-fat risks overly heavy mouthfeel. Salt and pepper balance acidity and fat; season gradually. Ready-made herbs from market work but fresh picked herbs make a difference, rinsed and dried to avoid watering down dressing."
instructionsNote: "Start by washing and preparing herbs and kale thoroughly. Dry them—water ruins emulsification and yields watery dressing. Cut avocado, scoop ripe flesh, don’t mix skin or pit bits. Put avocado and yogurt in blender first to create base; this prevents fiber from herbs breaking up too coarsely. Add acidic lime juice earlier in blending to prevent avocado from browning quickly. Blend greens and herbs last, pulse to preserve some texture. Stop blending as soon as homogenous smoothness reached. Scrape down blade and sides often—dressing tends to stick causing uneven texture otherwise. Add water little by little, blending between additions. Consistency should be creamy yet pourable. Season last, taste often; seasoning changes after resting too. Store in airtight container immediately, refrigerate. Expect slight darkening due to avocado oxidation but no sliminess; discard if foul odor or slime develops. Use within 4 days, never longer. Avoid metal containers for storage; glass or plastic preferred to minimize color changes."
tips:
- "Use ripe avocado; soft but not mushy. Brown spots okay, avoid any bitterness. Replace kale with spinach or arugula but adjust for flavor."
- "Adjust consistency by adding cold water. Go slow—thicker is sturdier. Blend, scrape sides often. No lumps wanted. Check for vibrant green."
- "Use fresh herbs for impact—cilantro and parsley preferred. Dried herbs don’t cut it here. Wash greens to avoid a watery dressing."
- "Storage matters. Airtight containers help. Expect slight darkening in fridge. Green should stay vibrant. Discard if foul smell or weird texture."
- "Seasoning is key. Salt enhances flavor. Tweak balance. Lime acidity crucial—check often. No bland allowed; add a pinch before serving."
faq:
- "q: How do I prevent browning? a: Lime juice helps. Blend in earlier, keep air out. Use airtight container. Fresh ingredients matter."
- "q: Can I use low-fat yogurt? a: Avoid it. Full-fat gives richness. Low-fat thins it out too much. Stick with 2%."
- "q: What if dressing is too thick? a: Add cold water in small increments. Blend between. Stop when pourable but rich texture remains."
- "q: How long does it last? a: Use within 4 days. Check regularly. Discard if rancid smell. No slime; texture should be fresh."
