ingredients:
- "1 jar 500 ml mixed olives with pits, drained and rinsed"
- "45 ml olive oil plus extra for lemon rubbing"
- "1 garlic clove, lightly crushed, unpeeled"
- "1 teaspoon anise seeds"
- "1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes"
- "1 whole lemon"
- "3 sprigs fresh rosemary"
- "20 ml anise-flavored spirit (arak, ouzo or pastis)"
instructions:
- "Heat a 25 cm cast iron skillet directly over high heat on the grill, preheating the grill to high."
- "Coat the lemon cut side lightly with olive oil."
- "Place the lemon cut side down on the grill grates. Grill 6 minutes until deeply caramelized but not burnt. Remove to plate."
- "In a bowl, toss olives with half the olive oil, garlic, anise seeds, and chili flakes."
- "Add olives to the hot skillet. Stir frequently while cooking for 3 minutes."
- "Add rosemary sprigs, pour in the anise spirit."
- "Flambé with a grill lighter if you want. Beware of flare-ups."
- "Reduce heat, let alcohol burn off for about 40 seconds until nearly evaporated. Remove from heat."
- "Drizzle remaining olive oil over olives, stir gently, then let sit 6 minutes to absorb flavors."
- "Squeeze grilled lemon over olives, mix and transfer to a serving bowl. Serve immediately."
introduction: "Olives hit the heat. Sweet anise seeds toast and crack. Lemon skin chars on the grill, caramelizing, giving smoky twist. Rosemary needles spike the air. Garlic lurks but hidden. Flambéing the anise spirit lights a quick blaze. Olive oil more than a dip, a finish, soaking into olives warm and glossy. Quick bites, vegan, simple, gluten-free, dairy and nut free—bites that seduce the senses. For any season. Concentrated, punchy flavors. Ready in under 25 minutes. Char, sizzle, squeeze, sit, serve. A burst on the tongue. The kind you want more of. Colors of the med, smoky, fresh, wild."
ingredientsNote: "Use a mix of olives with pits for crunch and authenticity—kalamata, green, black. Rinse for less salt if needed. Use fresh rosemary sprigs for aromatic notes, not dried. Anise seeds give warm, licorice-like crunch—don't replace with powder or lose texture. Dark lemons, ripe and fragrant, give best caramelization on grill. Olive oil quality impacts final finish—extra virgin recommended but not overpowering. The spirit can be any anise-flavored: ouzo, pastis or arak; swap for a mild brandy if preferred but lose herbs' twist. Garlic left unpeeled to avoid burnt bitter bits but infuses subtly."
instructionsNote: "Direct heat from the grill vital for caramelizing lemon properly without burning. Watch closely after 4 minutes; lemon can go from golden to black in a flash. Toss olives in oil and anise spices before heating to coat well and infuse. Stir frequently while cooking so they don’t stick or char too long. Flambé only if confident—flames can rise fast. Let alcohol burn off briefly to avoid harsh bite but maintain aroma. Resting olives off heat lets oil absorb flavors deeply and cool slightly for serving. Serve immediately after lemon juice squeezes to retain zest freshness. Can be prepped to the rest step beforehand and finished quickly at the last minute."
tips:
- "Use fresh olives with pits. Crunchy texture. Kalamata or green work well. Rinse them to cut salt. Fresh rosemary adds aroma. Don't use dried."
- "Anise seeds give unique crunch and flavor. Toast before adding to olives. Avoid using anise powder. It changes texture. Warm flavors essential."
- "Grill lemon until caramelized but carefully. Four to six minutes max. Monitor closely. Char adds smokiness, deeper flavor. Yum factor increased."
- "Let olives rest after cooking. Absorbs flavors, enhances taste. Six minutes off heat. Olive oil coats well. Warm, glossy finish is key."
- "Use quality olive oil. Extra virgin preferred. It impacts everything. Not overpowering, just right. Balance flavors. Adds depth to dish."
faq:
- "q: Can I use pitted olives? a: Yes but pits add crunch. Texture is different. Some prefer it smooth. Choice impacts experience."
- "q: What if I can't find anise spirit? a: Swap with mild brandy. Different taste though. Still good. But lose anise twist. Consider options."
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: In a container. Refrigerate up to three days. Reheat gently before eating. Flavors may change."
- "q: Can I use dried herbs? a: Fresh is better. Dried lacks flavor depth. Rosemary vital. Different outcome if dried. Might not be same."
