ingredients:
- "2 ribeye steaks about 1 inch thick"
- "2 tbsp paprika smoked (substitute regular paprika with chili powder)"
- "1 tbsp garlic powder"
- "1 tsp cayenne pepper"
- "1 tbsp kosher salt"
- "1 tsp black pepper freshly cracked"
- "4 large russet potatoes, cut into fries"
- "1/4 cup rendered duck fat (substitute peanut or vegetable oil)"
- "Salt for fries"
- "4 tbsp unsalted butter softened"
- "1 tbsp finely chopped fresh thyme"
- "1 small garlic clove minced"
- "1 tsp lemon zest"
- "Freshly cracked black pepper to finish"
instructions:
- "===Seasoning==="
- "Mix smoked paprika, garlic powder, cayenne, salt, and black pepper. Rub evenly into both sides of ribeye. Let steaks sit at room temp for 15 minutes before cooking to ensure even cooking and better crust."
- "===Fries prep==="
- "Toss potato sticks in a bowl with cold water, soak for 30 minutes to remove excess starch—important for crispness. Dry thoroughly with a kitchen towel."
- "Heat duck fat in heavy skillet over medium-high until shimmering but not smoking."
- "Add fries in batches, shaking pan often for even browning. Each batch about 7-10 minutes until golden with crisp edges. Drain on paper towels, salt while hot."
- "===Steak cook==="
- "Heat cast iron pan until nearly smoking. A whisper of oil only if pan not well-seasoned cast iron."
- "Place steaks down away from you, hear sharp sizzle. Resist moving. After 3 minutes edges start to darken and juices rise. Flip with tongs; 2-3 minutes second side. Use touch test: steak feels springy but not hard for medium rare."
- "Remove steak to rest on warm plate, tent loosely with foil for 5-7 minutes. Rest allows muscle fibers to relax and retain juice, yielding tenderness."
- "===Compound butter==="
- "While steak rests, mix softened butter with garlic, thyme, lemon zest, and cracked black pepper. Chill briefly or spoon directly atop steak before plating."
- "===Plate==="
- "Layer fries on plate. Position rested steak atop fries. Dollop compound butter that melts, pooling over meat. Visual cue: sheen on top indicates butter vs dry crust. Serve immediately."
- "===Notes==="
- "Steak thickness impacts times; thicker needs extra minute per side. Overcrowding pan reduces heat; cook steaks one at a time if needed. If fries soggy, bake at 400F for 5 minutes after frying to regain crunch. Always vent kitchen—smoke and aroma intense during searing."
introduction: "Start with a ribeye rubbed down with a smoky, slightly spicy mix. Not your usual herb blend but that kick sets it off. Fries? Thick, russet—drenched in duck fat for that rich, almost nutty finish. Skillet screaming hot, nearly smoking—the sound of steak hitting that pan is music. No oil if cast iron’s primo, else a splash—nothing greasy. Watch edges for crust forming; juices bubble up. Don’t poke or prod too soon or you lose the sear. Patience. Rest steak on warm plate, foiled but breathing. Compound butter is just garlic, fresh thyme, and lemon zest whipped in butter. Simple but the way it melts over steak—best finishing touch. Crisp fries underneath, steak on top, butter melting, juices mingling. Bistro at home. A touch smoky. A touch sharp. A whole lot real."
ingredientsNote: "Swapped traditional steakhouse rub for smoky paprika and cayenne for heat—balances richness from beef. Duck fat fries give deeper flavor compared to peanut oil, but peanut oil works with neutral notes. Russets soak in cold water before frying—key step for a crunchy exterior without toughness inside. Compound butter remains soft for melting instead of chilling firm; lemon zest adds brightness, cutting richness without thwacking the palate. If butter too stiff or steak too raw, heat rest plate gently; don’t skip that resting window—rest redistributes juices preventing dry bites and preserves tenderness. Cast iron ideal for sear; if using stainless steel, a tad more oil needed to avoid sticking."
instructionsNote: "High heat essential; cast iron must be nearly smoking to get proper sear—that crackle noise tells you so. Don’t flip steak too early or it sticks, crust suffers. Use touch test—not thermometer alone. Medium rare feels springy, medium a bit firmer, well done hard. Fries soak removes surface starch; dry thoroughly to prevent oil sputter and sogginess. Frying batches keeps oil temperature steady, avoids greasy, limp fries. Pat dry steak after seasoning if moist—help crust form. Compound butter isn’t just flavor; its melting finish adds silkiness and moisture, especially important if steak edges have firmed. Rest steak 5-7 minutes; too short and juices escape, too long and meat cools. Efficiency trick: While fries soak, prep butter and rub steak. When cooking, multitask by frying fries while steaks rest."
tips:
- "Choose well-marbled ribeye. Sear hot, almost smoking. Listen for sizzle. Crust forms, edges darken. No flipping too soon. Let it be."
- "Duck fat? Yes, if available. Richer than oils. Fry in batches. Don't overcrowd the pan; oil temperature drops, soggy fries result."
- "Rest steak post-cook. Five, seven minutes. Juices redistribute, more tender. Use warm plate—foil tent if needed. Avoid cooling."
- "Potatoes soak beforehand, cold water, 30 minutes. Removes excess starch, allows crisp exterior. Dry well before frying, prevents sogginess."
- "Compound butter, let it mix well. Garlic, thyme, lemon zest folded in. Spoon on warm steak just before serving. Melts nicely."
- "For fries, if soggy post-fry, bake for five minutes at 400F to regain crunch. Monitoring is key; check often."
- "Season steaks with spice blend. Smoked paprika, cayenne—adds heat. Apply an even coating. Let rest for 15 minutes."
- "For cast iron, ensure it's well-seasoned. Heat nearly smoking. Oil only if pan new; non-stick ideal. Minimal fuss."
faq:
- "q: What if steak gets too done? a: Watch carefully. Touch test for doneness; feel changes. If overdone, it’s tough."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Wrap airtight. Fridge for two days, reheat gently. Too high heat will ruin texture."
- "q: What if fries aren't crispy? a: Ensure dry before frying. Batch fries to keep temp up. If soft, bake briefly."
- "q: Using a different steak? a: Ribeye ideal but sirloin works. Cook slightly less time as it’s leaner. Adjust cooking method accordingly."
