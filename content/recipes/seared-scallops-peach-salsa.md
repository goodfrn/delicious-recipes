introduction: "Thin slices of fresh scallops meet a salsa that’s a little sweet, a touch spicy. Peaches swapped in place of strawberries, firmer texture, natural sweetness. Grape tomatoes replace cherry; a bit more bite, juicier burst. Serrano pepper instead of jalapeño – sharper heat, still tame. Green onion soaking in ice water for crispness, crunch. Apple cider vinegar brings the acidity, balanced by smooth avocado oil instead of plain vegetable. No cooking. Just slicing, mixing, plating. Quick. Light. A seafood appetizer that wakes things up. Bright, fresh, summery. Not a salad, not tartare. Something simple yet interesting. Chill the scallops briefly before slicing, helps firm flesh. Play with component sizes, bigger peach chunks, smaller tomato pieces. Salt, pepper a must. Don’t overdo the pepper, it’ll steal center stage. This is about balance and contrast. You can swap peaches with nectarines or even mango, but keep acidity intact."
ingredientsNote: "The green onion makes a subtle crunch after soaking in ice water briefly, cools the sharpness, adds freshness. The peach must be ripe but firm — too soft, it turns mushy in the salsa. Grape tomatoes are preferable for their juiciness and skin thickness; cherry tomatoes tend to fall apart quicker. Serrano pepper offers a sharper punch than jalapeño but in the lower quantity keeps the heat gentle. Apple cider vinegar is a mild acidity that complements the sweetness of fruit and cuts through the scallops well. Avocado oil used instead of neutral vegetable oil adds a light buttery note without overpowering other ingredients. Scallops sliced horizontally so each bite has thin, tender freshness, easier to eat as a bite-sized appetizer. Use the freshest scallops available. If slightly chilled before slicing, they hold shape better. One large scallop cut into four or five thin rounds each gives perfect single bites. Salt and black pepper must be adjusted at the end, to taste — don’t skip it. Let salsa rest for 5–7 minutes before assembling to marry flavors but make sure not to let the fruit release too much water or it becomes watery."
instructionsNote: "Start with soaking the sliced green onion in ice water, minimum 10 minutes helps crisp texture and tone down raw bite. While soaking, assemble the salsa by mixing peaches, tomatoes, minced serrano, apple cider vinegar, and avocado oil. Stir gently to keep fruit pieces intact. Add salt and fresh cracked pepper gradually, tasting for balance. The salsa should taste bright, with a mild spike of heat and acidity counterbalancing sweetness. Drain the onions well before plating. Arrange the scallops thinly on chilled plates or on a cold serving tray. Spoon a generous amount of salsa over each scallop slice, distributing evenly. Finish each plate with a small handful of the soaked green onion julienne. Serve immediately — do not let scallops sit too long with the wet salsa to avoid losing texture. This is a no-cook dish, relying on fresh, raw ingredients and delicate slicing. Adjust slicing thickness if scallops are small or large, aim for uniform bite-size pieces. Timing between assembly and serving crucial — best within 5 minutes. Can prepare salsa ahead and refrigerate, but do not mix scallops until serving to preserve texture."
tips:
- "Start with the green onion. Ice water is key for crispness. Soak for 10 minutes minimum. The crunch matters. Cuts the strong flavor. Drain well. Don’t skip this."
- "Peaches must be ripe but firm. Too soft? They get mushy. Use grape tomatoes over cherry. Better juiciness, thicker skin. Also, serrano pepper. Nice kick but manage the amount."
- "Chill your scallops before slicing. It keeps their shape. Thin rounds are best. Each piece should be easy to eat. Uniform slices help presentation."
- "Salsa can sit to marry flavors. But not too long. If they sit too long? They will get watery. Assemble right before serving. Keep the texture intact."
- "Adjust seasoning to taste. Salt and pepper — must not be skipped. The balance is essential. Bright flavors need to pop. Avoid overpowering any one ingredient."
