ingredients:
- "240 g spaghettinis"
- "150 g green beans trimmed and cut"
- "1 medium onion thinly sliced"
- "2 cloves garlic finely chopped"
- "50 ml olive oil plus extra for drizzling"
- "25 ml tomato paste"
- "400 g skinless cod fillets cubed"
- "2 large ripe tomatoes diced"
- "40 g pitted Kalamata olives halved"
- "70 ml water"
- "1 tbsp sweet paprika"
- "Â½ tsp crushed chili flakes"
- "3 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsley"
instructions:
- "Bring large pot of salted water to boil. Cook pasta and green beans until just tender but firm, about 8-9 minutes. Drain well."
- "Heat olive oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic, cook until softened, about 6 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and cook 1-2 minutes stirring constantly."
- "Add cod cubes, diced tomatoes, olives, water, paprika, and chili flakes. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Cover and simmer 7-9 minutes until cod flakes easily but still moist."
- "Fold drained pasta and green beans into the sauce carefully. Warm 2-3 minutes over low heat, tossing to coat thoroughly."
- "Adjust seasoning if needed. Scatter parsley on top. Drizzle with extra olive oil before serving."
introduction: "Spaghettinis teamed with green beans and fresh cod. No cream, no cheese, just the bare essentials. Garlic and onion softened slowly in good olive oil, then a hit of tomato paste to thicken the base. The cod cubes go in with juicy tomatoes and meaty Kalamata olives, spiced gently with paprika and chili flakes. Simmer until the fish just flakes. The pasta and beans come last, tossed and warmed through. Herbs and olive oil drizzle at the end. Clean, straightforward seafood meal, mediterranean-inspired, light yet filling. No fuss, no dairy, no nuts, no eggs. Just layering flavors and textures. Bright, slurpy, peppered with salty olives and fresh parsley. "
ingredientsNote: "Reduced spaghettinis quantity slightly to balance pasta with sauce. Green beans trimmed for tenderness but cut short for bite. Onion and garlic the flavor base, minced finely for quick cooking. Olive oil is essential here, enough to soften vegetables and carry tomato paste flavor. Used sweet paprika over smoked. Kalamata olives sliced, not crushed, to add texture pockets. Fresh tomatoes diced, not pureed, offering chunks in sauce. Water added to loosen sauce but not too much to dilute flavors. Parsley chopped but added at end keeps freshness. Measurements adjusted by approximately 30 percent from original to yield balanced portioning for sauce and pasta."
instructionsNote: "Pasta and beans cooked in same pot to save time, maintaining al dente bite. Onion and garlic softened over medium heat to avoid browning for mellow flavor. Tomato paste added and cooked briefly to develop taste but avoid bitterness. Fish and vegetables added then covered to simmer gently, ensuring even cooking without breaking fish apart. Timing adjusted slightly to 7-9 minutes for cod doneness. Pasta and beans folded in last, warming through without further cooking, preserving texture. Stirring gentle to keep fish chunks intact. Seasoning adjusted at end to taste since olives add salt. Parsley and olive oil finishing touches added right before serving to keep bright notes alive."
tips:
- "Timing is crucial with pasta and beans. Keep them firm but tender. Use a timer. Drain immediately. Combine with sauce at just the right moment."
- "Use fresh fish. Quality cod matters. Frozen works, but fresh has better flavor. Check for skinless fillets, no bones to worry about. Save time in prep."
- "Seasoning will make or break this dish. Adjust salt after tasting. Olives add brininess. Taste as you cook. Balance spice levels. Adjust according to preference."
- "Pasta and green beans cook well together. One pot saves time, foolproof method ensures beans stay crisp, not mushy. Add them at the right moment, they complement each other."
- "Garnish at the end. Fresh parsley brings brightness. Olive oil drizzle adds richness. Don't skip it. These enhance flavors. Small touches elevate the whole dish."
