ingredients:
- "85 ml (⅓ cup) sifted cacao powder"
- "260 ml (1 cup) coconut milk powder"
- "240 ml (1 cup) maple sugar"
- "140 g roughly chopped white chocolate"
- "60 g cocoa nibs"
- "8 ml (1½ tsp) cornstarch"
instructions:
- "Set up food processor. Add cacao, coconut milk powder, maple sugar, cornstarch, cocoa nibs."
- "Pulse until cocoa nibs broken into small pieces but not powder."
- "Add chopped white chocolate last. Blend briefly to mix whites but keep chunks."
- "Divide mixture evenly into 3 sterile jars about 280 ml each."
- "Seal jars air tight. Label and store cool, dark place."
- "To serve, heat 200 ml hot water or plant milk per jar portion and stir well."
- "Adjust sweetness if needed by adding more sugar or cinnamon on top."
introduction: "Dark, rich cocoa powder. Coconut milk powder for dairy-free creaminess. Maple sugar gives deeper tones than white sugar. White chocolate chunks instead of dark mix, surprise bursts. Cocoa nibs, bitterness to lift. Dry mix easy to gift - just stir and heat. Keep it simple. Mix all dry bits, portion then seal tight. A jar of warmth against cold days. No eggs, gluten, nuts, or lactose. Rustic, home style, but with a twist. Shelf housing good, thickness from cornstarch. Little adjustments. 3 jars filling 280 ml each, mid-sizes to hold and gift. Skip fresh milk—powders work longer shelf life. Hot water or nut milk, up to needing extra stirring. Versatility included. Cocoa, crunch, sweet snaps inside."
ingredientsNote: "Coconut milk powder replaces dairy milk for lactose-free and vegan option; adds rich texture but lighter flavor base than traditional powdered milk. Maple sugar has a more complex sweetness and lower glycemic index than refined white sugar; creates subtle caramel notes. Cocoa nibs introduce crunchy texture and stronger cocoa flavor over chopped chocolate alone. White chocolate chunks meld slowly in hot beverage, adding creamy pockets contrasting the dark cacao base. Cornstarch reduces clumping and adds a mild thickening effect when the mix dissolves in hot liquid. Sifting cacao powder prevents lumps in the dry mix. Jars should be sterilized and fully dry to avoid moisture spoiling the mix. Portion size balances gift and consumption practicality."
instructionsNote: "Using a food processor to mix all dry ingredients but preserving chunkiness from nibs and white chocolate encourages textural contrast in final drink. Pulsing but not blending continuously avoids powder turning too fine or chocolates melting prematurely. Adding white chocolate last reduces melting from friction heat in processor. Dividing evenly ensures consistent jar yields. Airtight sealing is critical for freshness and moisture protection of powdered mix, which is hygroscopic. When serving, recommend stirring vigorously or using a whisk to properly dissolve mix in hot water or milk. Optionally add spices on serving to complement base notes—cinnamon, vanilla, or chili. Stirring hot liquid vigorously breaks up cornstarch thickener. Adjust heating times by 5 minutes depending on serving size or ambient temperature for smooth, even melt of chocolate bits. Shelf life best within 4 months stored cool and dry."
tips:
- "Use food processor for dry ingredients. Keep chunks in cocoa nibs. Pulsing better than blending all time. Avoid turning everything to powder. Cocoa nibs give texture. White chocolate last means less melting. Important—ensure even mixture."
- "Jars must be sterile before filling. This prevents spoilage. Fully dry, critical step. Air tight seal needed to keep moisture out. Storage cool and dark extends shelf life. Stack jars on shelves, away from sunlight. Light damages mix over time."
- "Hot water for preparation. But plant milk works too. 200 ml per jar for serving is ideal. Stir mix into hot liquid well. Whisk helps break clumps, evenly dissolving. Adjust sweetness as desired. Add spices like cinnamon for extra flavor."
- "Cornstarch helps mix thicken slightly when hot. Reduces clumping issue, key for smooth drink. Sifting cacao powder prevents lumps. Mix blended well, but texture preserved. Dividing jars evenly matters for right portions. Measure properly for consistency."
- "Keep it stored in a cool place. Avoid humidity at all costs. Use within four months for best results. Check jars regularly, freshness fades over time. If clumping occurs, reprocess dry bits. Can keep mix longer with good care."
faq:
- "q: What if cocoa mix clumps? a: Mix may clump due to moisture. Sifting helps. Store in dry place. Resealing jars tight prevents it. Also, reprocess dry bits before using."
- "q: How long does it last? a: Shelf life about four months. Store cool, avoid humidity. Refrigeration not needed. Check jars for moisture each week. Use quickly for best taste."
- "q: Can I adjust sweetness? a: Yes, add more maple sugar or other sweeteners. Stir in cinnamon or vanilla for contrast. Play with flavors. A little here or there can shift profile."
- "q: Storage for left over jars? a: Keep sealed in dark, cool area. Extra measures include vacuum sealing if available. Should never be exposed to air. This keeps mix fresh longer."
