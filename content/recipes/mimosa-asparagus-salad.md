ingredients:
- "315 g medium asparagus, trimmed"
- "1 hard-boiled egg"
- "12 ml apple cider vinegar"
- "6 ml whole grain mustard"
- "40 ml walnut oil"
- "12 ml chopped capers"
- "Salt and pepper"
instructions:
- "1. Bring salted water to robust boil. Blanch asparagus 4 minutes till just tender. Drain, pat dry with paper towel. Let cool to warm."
- "2. Separate yolk and white from hard boiled egg. Using fine side of grater, shred white finely, then yolk separately. Set aside."
- "3. In small bowl, whisk vinegar and whole grain mustard together. Slowly drizzle oil while whisking until emulsified. Stir in chopped capers. Season with salt and pepper."
- "4. In large bowl, toss asparagus with 25 ml dressing. Taste, adjust seasoning if needed."
- "5. Arrange asparagus on serving plate. Sprinkle grated egg parts on top in sections, whites then yolks. Pour remaining dressing evenly over salad."
introduction: "Asparagus, barely cooked, firm bite. Egg grated sharp, two colors plain but striking. Dressing keeps acid bright but swaps out usual ingredients for new notes—apple cider vinegar’s tang, walnut oil’s depth. Capers instead of cornichons give a briny kick yet different crunch. Simple, fragmented but layers of flavor. Quickly tossed and plated. A salad open to improv. Short cook, preparation, then done. Uses few ingredients but plays with textures and tastes. No sweetness, no cream, no gluten. Rustic yet refined. Think spring market, rough edges, fresh but controlled."
ingredientsNote: "Asparagus quantity reduced slightly to keep balance with dressing and egg. Apple cider vinegar brings sharper acid than traditional white wine vinegar, cuts through fat differently. Walnut oil adds richness and subtle nutty flavor but if allergic, use olive oil. Whole grain mustard replaces Dijon for more texture, slightly tempered spiciness. Capers stand in for cornichons, delivering salt and tang, less crunch but more moisture. Egg remains a visual and textural element, grated relies on proper separation and careful handling. Keep asparagus firm to avoid soggy end. Salt and pepper always to personal preference."
instructionsNote: "Blanching increased by 1 minute for just softer asparagus to complement walnut oil’s richness. Cooling on towels dries excess water and prevents dilution of dressing. Grating egg white and yolk separately for contrast, delicate touch needed so white doesn’t crumble. Emulsifying dressing slow to avoid separation, capers stirred at end to keep texture intact. Toss sparingly, preserve asparagus integrity. Using part of dressing upfront allows seasoning, rest to dress beautifully at plating. Presentation important: colors separated but together on plate. Timing adjusted slightly for texture balance—a little longer cook and dressing thicker with walnut oil."
tips:
- "Blanching asparagus? Pay attention to timing. Just 4 minutes but can tweak for personal texture. Too soft, lose bite. Pat dry after. Water pools ruin dressing."
- "Eggs are essential here. Grate whites and yolks separately. Watch for crumbling, need finesse. Distinct looks, textures show on plate. Always keep it neat."
- "Dressing is crucial. Whisk vinegar and mustard well. Slowly add oil, emulsification matters. Adjust tanginess, flavor depth. Capers are for salty, briny touch, not just crunch."
- "Presentation impacts experience. Arrange asparagus elegantly. Grated egg nicely displayed in sections, whites and yolks distinct. Attention to color matters, visual appeal."
- "Seasoning often taken lightly. Salt and pepper to personal taste. Don’t forget this. Balance flavors, let each ingredient shine. Simple, without overpowering."
faq:
- "q: How to ensure asparagus is crisp? a: Timing is key, only 4 minutes. Too much heat makes it soggy. Ice bath? Not needed but cool on towels."
- "q: Can I use a different oil? a: Yes, olive oil works in a pinch. Won't be same nutty flavor, though. Can also experiment with other oils but taste may shift."
- "q: How to store the salad leftovers? a: Best enjoyed fresh. But can refrigerate for a day or so. Cover well. If soggy, drain before serving. Textural issues arise."
- "q: What if I don't have capers? a: Substitute with olives for salty kick. Or even pickles if desperate. But adjust seasoning then. Tastes will alter, experiment."
