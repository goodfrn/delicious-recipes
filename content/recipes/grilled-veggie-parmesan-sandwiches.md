instructions:
- "=== Assembly and Prep ==="

- "Season cut vegetables with olive oil, sea salt, and pepper on a baking tray or plate."
- "=== Grilling ==="
- "Heat grill or barbecue on high. Oil the grill grates."

- "Grill cut sides of bread until toasted and golden, about 4 minutes."
- "=== Spread and Assemble ==="
- "Mix parmesan, sun-dried tomatoes, olive oil, capers, vinegar, lemon zest, garlic. Season with salt and pepper."
- "Chop grilled peppers thinly."
- "Spread the parmesan mixture on inside of the toasted bread halves."

- "Close sandwiches. Cut each sandwich in half. Serve immediately."
introduction: "Grilling veggies with a quick brush of oil. Eggplant and zucchini get a bit thinner, quick roasting, quick caramelizing. Peppers chunkier, a bit longer to soften, charred bits add punch. Fresh basil waits in the wings. Crusty bread gets a quick turn on the grill, inside crisped, outside just enough. Parmesan spread with zingy sun-dried tomatoes, sharp leash of lemon zest and garlicky heat. Capers cutting through the richness with vinegar tang. Sandwiches made fast, fresh, rustic. No fuss. No nuts. A meal ready for eating straight from the hands. Grab, bite, basil snap."
ingredientsNote: "Cut back parmesan to avoid overpowering, dial down oil a bit for lighter spread. Tomatoes not soaked in excess oil keep it bright. Capers low quantity for salty punch but not bitterness. Smaller cuts of eggplant and zucchini for faster cooking and even char. Red pepper strips wider for texture contrast. Extra oil on bread keeps crunch without sogginess later. Basil best fresh, added last to keep aroma sharp. Lemon zest instead of juice to preserve texture and boost fragrance."
instructionsNote: "Skip overheating grill to prevent burning delicate slices. Timing staggered: peppers longer, veggies quicker. Trim oil use to lightly coat, not drown. Use tongs to flip, keep shape intact. Spread prepped while bread grills for smooth prep rhythm. Layer veggies and spread with care to avoid mess. Salt after veggies grilled, holds crispness. Cut carefully to keep layered structure intact. Serve asap to maintain textures and freshly grilled flavors."
tips:
- "Use fresh veggies. They pop in flavor. Cut zucchini, eggplant thinner for quick grill, not mushy. Sprinkle sea salt after grilling. It brings out taste."
- "Grill bread until golden. A bit longer, keep an eye on it. Olive oil is key. Brush inside for moisture. Helps contrast crunchy outside."
- "Mix parmesan carefully with sun-dried tomatoes. Not too much oil. Keep it zingy. Lemon zest brightens. Use more garlic for kick."
- "Layer carefully for best texture. Don’t overstuff. Look for balance. Basil goes on last. Freshness isn’t just flavor; it’s aroma."
- "Serve quickly. Sandwiches can get soggy. Ideal to bite right after assembly. Freshly grilled flavor disappears. Crunch matters."
