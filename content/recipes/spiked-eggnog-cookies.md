slug: "spiked-eggnog-cookies"
description: "Tender but sturdily soft cookies with eggnog and an extract twist. Brown sugar and butter creamed just right, folding in flour with bumpy texture. Chilly dough, rolled thick, cut out and baked till edges just start to firm. Rum extract swapped for bourbon, and cardamom traded in for cinnamon for a different spice profile. Frosted with boozy buttercream, nutmeg gives it the classic holiday scent. Chill dough to handle easier. Watch for slight browning at edges, not full golden. Room temp storing keeps them soft, freeze before frosting if stashing for later."

ingredients:
- "2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour"
- "1/4 tsp fine sea salt"
- "1/2 tsp baking soda"
- "1 cup unsalted butter softened"
- "1 cup light brown sugar packed"
- "2 large egg yolks"
- "4/5 cup eggnog"
- "1 tsp bourbon extract"
- "1/2 tsp ground cardamom"
- "Frosting:"
- "6 tbsp unsalted butter softened"
- "3/4 tsp bourbon extract"
- "1/4 tsp ground nutmeg"
- "1/4 tsp ground ginger"
- "3 1/4 cups powdered sugar"
- "6 tbsp eggnog"
instructions:
- "=== Dough prep ==="
- "Sift flour, salt, baking soda together in medium bowl. No clumps, no lumps. Keep nearby."
- "In big bowl or mixer with paddle, cream butter and brown sugar until light and just combined—don’t overbeat or won’t hold shape."
- "Add egg yolks, eggnog, bourbon extract, mix slow so no splatters. Wet mixture should look creamy but loose."
- "Slowly incorporate dry mix with spatula or mixer on low; mix until dough just sticks, soft but not sticky to fingers."
- "Wrap dough in plastic; refrigerate 60 to 90 minutes. Cold dough holds shape when rolling out—don’t skip chilling or cookies spread out."
- "=== Baking ==="
- "Preheat oven 345°F—you want hot enough for edges to firm but centers still tender."
- "Flour board generously; roll chilled dough to about 1/2 inch thick—if too thin, cookies get crumbly; thicker holds moisture."
- "Use 2 1/2 inch cutter, round or holiday shapes. If dough softens while rolling, pop back in fridge 10 minutes."
- "Place cookies spaced on parchment-lined sheet—edges may touch but won’t fuse if chilled."
- "Bake 9 to 14 minutes depending on oven, watch edges for dull matte look and slight golden tint. Centers should look set but soft."
- "Cool on sheet 5 minutes, then transfer carefully to wire rack to cool completely. Hot cookies fragile."
- "=== Frosting and finishing ==="
- "Beat butter in medium bowl until fluffy. Add bourbon extract, nutmeg, ginger, and eggnog, whisk until smooth."
- "Gradually add powdered sugar by half cups, beating well after each addition. Frosting should be thick enough to pipe but spreadable."
- "Spread thin layer of frosting on each cooled cookie. Let set at room temp about 45 minutes or until firm to touch."
- "Stack with parchment paper between or store single layer. Cookies can be kept at room temperature for days."
- "If saving longer, freeze plain baked cookies in airtight container. Frost after thawing to avoid sogginess."
introduction: "Cold kitchen, dough chilling sly in the fridge. Cookie cutters ready—round, star, whatever. Eggnog scent sneak in the room, warming nostrils. You want dough that’s soft not sloppy. Butter creamed, sugar melded, yolks hit the mix to bind all together. Flour comes in dry, sifted, bumpy with texture. Don't just dump it in; fold gently keeping the work low, preserve softness. Chill it enough; dough holds shape like a good handshake. Oven buzzes at 345°F, cookies placed out evenly. Edges firm up, centers stay soft, watch for dull, matte moments baking makes. Frosting with bourbon extract, nutmeg spice in the mix, beat to fluffy peaks. Spread with care once cookies cool down—too soon and it melts like snow. Don’t rush stacking or storing, parchment paper guards each layer. Freeze un-frosted if you plan ahead—dry frosting never sets right. These aren’t just cookies; they carry holiday presence, no fuss, just technique and patience."
ingredientsNote: "Swapped rum extract for bourbon extract for deeper, mellow warmth. Cardamom replaces cinnamon for a bright, slightly citrusy undertone—break from tradition but still seasonal. Eggnog amount slightly reduced for sturdier dough that doesn’t spread too thin. Use fine sea salt to balance sweetness but avoid coarse textures that muddle dough. Brown sugar provides moisture and slight chew, white sugar replaced here to make it softer and less crunchy. Butter softened precisely not melted—if too warm, cookies lose shape; too cold, creaming struggles. Egg yolks add richness without extra moisture; don’t confuse with whole eggs or you risk a wetter dough. Powdered sugar in frosting measured gradually to avoid over-thick or runny frosting. If fresh eggnog isn’t on hand, substitute with half cream and half milk plus vanilla, but texture will differ. Keep powdered sugar airtight to avert clumps."
instructionsNote: "Don’t rush flour mixing—sift or whisk dry ingredients to avoid pockets of baking soda or salt that give bitter bites. Creaming butter and sugar together isn’t just mixing, it aerates, lightens dough so cookies aren’t dense. Too long or fast, butter melts; *bad.* Add egg yolks and eggnog slow—prevent curdling or splitting. Folding flour? Use spatula, low speed mixer; overmixing develops gluten and makes tough cookies. Chilling seals dough structure, firms fats—skip chilling, cookies WILL spread flat, no reclaiming here. Rolling thick enough creates soft interior, thinner cookies bake too crisp, dry. Watch oven closely—edges should dull, not brown rubbery. Baking times shift with altitude and oven quirks; listen for quiet crackles halting or subtle firmness when nudged. Frosting temperature crucial—too cold makes clumpy, too warm runs off. Beat to light fluffy texture, not whipped cream peaks—stiff enough to hold shape but sinks slightly when spread. Let frosting set at room temp; refrigeration can cause sweating or dull appearance."
tips:
- "Chill dough properly; protects shape when rolling. Soft tacky dough makes mess. If sticky, dust lightly. Use more flour or chill longer. Cool kitchen, dough holds well. Need cold surface too."
- "Rolling too thin? Resulting cookies crumble. Go thicker for soft centers. About 1/2 inch thick, reliable. Don’t rush—too much heat makes butter melt. Firmness matters. Keep fridge handy."
- "Watch oven closely at end. Edges should dull, centers remain soft. Bake times vary with oven quirks. Trust sights and smells—subtle differences guide timing. Pull from oven before full golden."
- "For frosting, beat butter until fluffy. Pay attention to temp; too cold clumps, too warm runs. Gradual sugar add; avoid runny disasters. Spread thin or pipe, preference plays role."
- "Store cookies properly. Layer with parchment for prevention against sticking. Room temp keeps softness; if freezing, omit frosting. Straight baked, airtight container; lasts longer."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid spreading dough? a: Chill, chill, chill. Warm dough spreads, cold dough shapes. Wrap tight, refrigerate 60-90 mins, hardens it. If dough sticks, flour hands, surface."
- "q: Substitutes for eggnog? a: Mix half cream and half milk, vanilla for flavor. Texture slightly off; results vary. Fresh eggnog preferred but some flexibility helps. Be ready for change."
- "q: Common baking issues? a: Overbaking leads to toughness. Focus on edges dulling, centers tender. Ingredients matter; stick to measurements. Improper mixing causes density. Simple rechecking saves."
- "q: Best storage methods? a: Room temp works for few days. Airtight containers keep moisture. Freeze un-frosted, prevent sogginess. Use parchment if stacking. Frost last minute—freshness hits."
