ingredients:
- "1 small onion sliced thin"
- "2 cloves garlic minced fine"
- "Juice 1 small lemon"
- "125 ml (1/2 cup) vegetable oil"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) soy sauce"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) maple syrup"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) freshly grated ginger"
- "1 ml (1/4 tsp) cayenne pepper"
- "2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) coriander seeds"
- "10 ml (2 tsp) ground coriander"
- "1 dried bay leaf"
- "1 cinnamon stick"
- "1 sprig fresh thyme"
- "1 sprig fresh rosemary"
- "Few dashes hot sauce (optional)"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) crushed black peppercorns"
- "600 g (1 1/3 lb) sirloin beef cut to 16 cubes ~4 cm (1 1/2 in)"
- "20 multicolored bell pepper cubes"
- "4 long metal or soaked wooden skewers"
instructions:
- "Combine onion slices, garlic, lemon juice, oil, soy, maple syrup, ginger in a sturdy bowl. Toss in cayenne, coriander seeds lightly crushed, ground coriander. Add bay leaf, cinnamon stick, thyme, rosemary, some hot sauce if you dare, cracked peppercorns. Stir well. In goes beef cubes. Press down. Cover tight. Refrigerate minimum 3.5 hours. Longer if time allows — flavor grows deep into meat fibers."
- "Prepare grill or barbecue set to high. Oil grate with paper towel dipped in oil—prevents stuck meat. When hot, grilling sounds start—a sizzling symphony."
- "Thread beef and pepper cubes alternately on skewers. Close packing but not crowding—better heat circulation."
- "Lay skewers on grill. Listen for immediate sizzle. Charred edges forming? Flip every 2 minutes, about 10 minutes total. Pink center shows medium-rare. If preferring more done, add 2-3 minutes. Use finger test for firmness or thermometer (~55C/130F rare, 60C/140F medium)."
- "Remove skewers. Tent loosely with foil. Rest 5-8 minutes. This stops juices fleeing, keeps meat juicy, tender. Serve immediately."
introduction: "Beef skewers marinated with nuanced spice layers, savory tang, subtle heat. Skip the usual clove; cayenne packs a modest punch without overpowering sweet maple notes. Lime juice slices through the richness, prevents meat from drying, acts as natural tenderizer but don’t marinate too long or protein turns mushy. Bell peppers add crunch, sweet freshness, and visual pop. Grilling over intense heat seals meat quickly, caramelizing edges that crunch, exuding smoky aroma. Crucial to oil your grill—prevents skewers becoming lost victims of the grates. Timing is guideline; watch for color changes and feel the meat’s springiness rather than rely solely on clocks. Improvisation helps: no rosemary, use oregano; no maple, honey still works but watch sweetness. If stuck indoors, cast iron pan masterfully substitutes. Learn to read meat, the smell, sound, and sight—best way to nail doneness every time."
ingredientsNote: "Substitutions: Lemon juice replaces lime juice smoothly, maintaining acidity. Maple syrup swapped instead of honey avoids bee products but still adds caramelization and sweetness. Cayenne delivers fiery brightness in lieu of the harder-to-find clove ground spice. Fresh herbs like thyme and rosemary build complexity; if missing rosemary, oregano or marjoram can slide right in. Soy sauce is key for that umami hit, but tamari or coconut aminos work for gluten sensitive. Crushed peppercorns lend crunch and fragrance; freshly ground preferred over pre-ground. Bell peppers — red, yellow, green — for color and natural sweetness contrast the meat’s savory depth. Using metal skewers avoids soaking time; if using wooden, soak for minimum 30 minutes to prevent burning. Cut beef evenly for consistent cook time, about 3.5-4 cm cubes—too small leads to dryness, too large can cause uneven cooking."
instructionsNote: "For marinade, mixing thoroughly incorporates spices and oils into the onions, garlic, and acids—this ensures every cube is evenly seasoned. Avoid marinating past 6 hours—acid breaks down protein too far, resulting in mushy texture. Heating grill well before cooking is essential; hot grates give immediate SIZZLE and that crusty sear you want. Oil grate with dampened cloth — prevents bind; little tip I learned over 20 years. Alternate meat and bell pepper cubes; peppers release moisture, help moderate cooking temperature around meat. Cooking time ranges from 8-12 minutes depending on heat source and skewer thickness. Flip frequently to avoid burning sugars in the marinade. Watch for juices running clear and firm resilience in meat via finger test to signal readiness. Resting meat off heat with foil retains juices—don’t skip. Serving fresh off skewers while warm highlights contrasting textures—the slight smokiness against cool fresh peppers. If grilling isn’t an option, pan-sear on high heat, finishing in very hot oven for 3-4 minutes. Skewers off, let’s eat."
tips:
- "Marinate beef at least 3.5 hours. Flavors deepen. Too long, feel mushy. Always feel meat before and after."
- "Heat grill until screaming hot. Oil grates first. Prevent sticking. No oil, no sizzle. Hear that sound?"
- "Choose metal skewers. No soaking time. Wooden ones, soak 30 minutes, don’t burn. Prevent charred sticks."
- "Cook over high heat. Flip every 2 minutes. Want pink center for medium-rare. Press for firmness. Thermometer helps too."
- "Rest skewers after grilling. 5-8 minutes under foil. Keeps juices in meat. Essential. Prevents dryness. Juicy texture."
