ingredients:
- "1 large bulb of fennel cut into 6 wedges"
- "80 ml (1/3 cup) low-sodium chicken broth"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) unsalted butter"
- "10 ml (2 tsp) finely minced shallots"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) fresh flat-leaf parsley chopped"
- "1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg"
- "Zest of 1 small lemon"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Warm up grill to medium heat; aim for 180-200°C. Foil must be heavy duty to prevent tears under steam."
- "Lay two foil sheets overlapping, shiny side in. Center fennel wedges evenly, no crowding, helps even steam circulation."
- "Scatter minced shallots on fenouil, pour broth and dot butter on top; lemon zest scattered last, salt and cracked pepper lightly across."
- "Seal the foil tight—fold edges twice to trap steam fully. Double layer stops leaks and flare-ups."
- "Place papillote on grill rack, close lid. Listen for gentle hissing steam—start checking after 20 minutes."
- "Feel through foil; fennel should be tender but not mushy, edges softened with slight translucent sheen, not browning too much."
- "Open carefully to avoid steam burn. Sprinkle parsley, stir gently inside parcel to coat fennel in buttery juices."
- "Serve immediately in foil or plated, squeezing extra lemon juice if desired."
introduction: "Fennel's an underrated vegetable that rewards gentle handling. Keep wedges thicker than thin slices; too small and they turn mush. Steam in foil traps steam, the way chefs coax flavor without waterlogging. Swapping classic fennel fronds for parsley adds a fresh herbal note that balances butter’s richness and lemon zest cuts through fatty mouthfeel. Shallots in place of garlic deliver softened, mellow garlicky aroma without sharpness. Cooking on grill rather than oven creates subtle smoky undertone—watch the foil for leaks to prevent flare-ups. Timing varies; tactile feel and sight beats any stopwatch."
ingredientsNote: "Adjust broth volume if replacing chicken broth with vegetable stock or mushroom broth for vegan flavor. Butter may be swapped with olive oil, but expect less silky mouth-coating. Parsley adds bright herby pop, but dill or tarragon can be alternatives. Shallots bring subtle sweetness; if unavailable, green onions or mild red onion works, just sauté briefly beforehand to soften harsh edge. Lemon zest injects freshness; omit if using more intense herbs. Salt judiciously—broth already salty sometimes. Nutmeg is subtle; freshly grated mandatory for aroma. Heavy-duty foil critical to prevent steam leaks and preserve texture."
instructionsNote: "Prep takes less than 10 minutes but precision matters. Overcrowding fennel wedges packs steam unevenly—results in mushy or crunchy bits. Double-layer foil seals in steam and prevents juices dripping onto grill causing flares. Medium grill heat mimics oven’s gentle roasting; too hot burns the butter or dries fennel. Key is texture: tender through but slight resistance like a crisp calamari. Visual clues: foil puffs then settles means steam trapped well. Open carefully—escaping steam is hot and fast. Toss parsley immediately inside foil to keep freshness and avoid floating away. Serve hot; cooling compresses texture. If no grill, oven at 190°C works but watch time carefully."
tips:
- "Choose thick fennel wedges. Too thin? They'll mush. Maintain own structure for steaming. Grilling adds great flavor—but less water. Balance moisture."
- "Overcrowding? No good. Steam needs space. Even heat circulation matters. Check that foil seals tightly. Double layers avoid burns, leaks."
- "Watch the grill temp. 180-200°C works best. Too high? Butter burns. Fennel dries out. Listen for steam hissing – it’s time to peek."
- "If using veggie stock, adjust broth ratio. Olive oil instead of butter? Risky. Texture changes, less richness."
- "Can’t find shallots? Use mild red onion. Saute first; soften the edges. Saves the dish from harsh flavors."
faq:
- "q: How do I know when the fennel is done? a: Look for translucent edges. Firm but tender. Shouldn’t fall apart. Wait for that gentle hissing."
- "q: Can I prepare in advance? a: Sure! Pack it, refrigerate. Just adjust cooking time if cold. Don’t want mushy edges."
- "q: Storing leftovers? a: Keep sealed in the fridge. Eat within two days—freshness matters. Reheat gently; avoid sogginess."
- "q: What if I don’t have a grill? a: Oven works; set to 190°C. Watch closely. Steam still traps aroma and flavor but can dry out faster."
