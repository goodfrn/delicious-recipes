title: "Peach Cherry Cobbler Remix"
slug: "peach-cherry-cobbler-remix"
description: "A rustic fruit cobbler combining fresh peaches and cherries tossed in sugar and spices, topped with a dense, almond-infused batter. Uses a baking dish around 9 x 13 inches sprayed lightly to prevent sticking. The batter includes almond paste swapped in for heavy cream for richness, while using lemon zest to add brightness. Bake at moderate heat till fruit bubbles thickly and topping browns evenly. Let rest before serving for juices to thicken and flavors to settle. Works best with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for contrast. Key techniques include properly folding fruit with sugar to draw juices without mush, batter consistency adjustments, and observing visual cues over timers. Substitutions for almond paste and fruit options included."

ingredients:
- "Cooking spray for pan"
- "1 1/2 cups granulated sugar, divided"
- "1 tablespoon cornstarch"
- "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon"
- "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "3 cups sliced peaches (fresh or frozen, thawed, drained)"
- "3 cups pitted cherries (fresh or frozen, thawed)"
- "1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour"
- "1 teaspoon baking powder"
- "1/4 teaspoon baking soda"
- "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "10 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened"
- "1/4 cup almond paste (or substitute 1/4 cup extra butter)"
- "2 large eggs"
- "1 teaspoon lemon zest (twist to brightness)"
- "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 355 degrees Fahrenheit. Lightly spray a 9 x 13 inch pan; sets stage for easy release."
- "In large bowl, whisk 1 cup sugar with cornstarch, cinnamon, salt until uniform. Toss peaches and cherries to coat—this draws moisture out without turning slushy. Pour fruit layer into pan, spread evenly."
- "Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt in medium bowl. Set aside dry mix for texture control."
- "Using stand mixer paddle or hand mixer, beat softened butter, remaining 1/2 cup sugar and almond paste on medium-high. Five minutes until creamy, pale, almost fluffy—key step for light crumb."
- "Add eggs one by one, making sure each is fully incorporated before next. Stir in lemon zest and vanilla for subtle lift."
- "Slowly add dry ingredients to wet, mixing on low to avoid overworking gluten. Batter thick but spoonable — like dollopable dough."
- "Spoon 12 rounded dollops over fruit, spacing so topping browns evenly, peeking through fruit juices."
- "Bake 50-60 minutes. Watch for golden brown crust with slightly cracked edges. Fruit juices should bubble thick and dark; not watery or runny."
- "Remove, allow to stand at least 20 minutes. Rest time thickens fruit juices into spoonable syrup. Serve warm with big scoop vanilla bean ice cream."
- "If baking ahead, cool fully unwrapped before covering - prevents soggy topping."
introduction: "Peach and cherry mingle here under a sweet, almond-kissed topping. Not your usual cobbler, because swapping in almond paste lets you skip cream-heavy steps while locking in deep, nutty richness. Start fruit with sugar and cornstarch to coax out natural juices but keep structure intact. Toss of cinnamon for warmth, lemon zest for brightness. The batter's a dance of creaminess and gentle rise, eggs beaten to fluff, dry ingredients folded carefully so topping stays light, not gummy or dense. Baking time varies but rely on senses: bubbles thicken, crust browns, aromas spill—then a rest that’s mandatory. Cool down before wrapping - moisture buildup ruins crisp outsides. Classic with vanilla ice cream, balance of warm, cold, soft, crisp. A few ingredient switches shake the formula up just right, keeping the whole thing approachable, no-fuss but reliable."
ingredientsNote: "Use fresh stone fruit when you can - obviously. Frozen works; thaw and drain to avoid watery soggy bottom. Cornstarch keeps juices syrupy not runny; essential for fruit with varying water content like cherries and peaches. Cinnamon is optional but recommended for fragrant warmth. Swap almond paste for extra butter if you can’t find it; the flavor will shift slightly, but richness stays. Lemon zest brightens batter, no juice included or it’ll thin. Butter must be soft, room temp not melted—this traps air beating sugar and almond paste for the right crumb texture. Kosher salt essential; regular salt is finer so reduce by half if substituting to avoid oversalting. Baking powder and baking soda combo stabilizes rise and prevents dense spots. Vanilla extract rounds flavor but can be omitted if unavailable."
instructionsNote: "Don’t rush beating butter, sugar, and almond paste. Five minutes on high is key to lightness – no shortcuts or batter becomes dense. Eggs one at a time ensure full emulsification. When adding dry, slow and low speed prevents tough crust. Dollop batter on top rather than spreading smooth; allows uneven peaks to brown and crack beautifully. Watch fruit closely near end of baking; bubbling dark juices signal concentrated sweetness and thick consistency. If topping browns too fast, loosely tent foil mid-way. Let cobbler rest after oven; immediate serving yields runny juices; waiting thickens fruit syrup naturally. If storing leftovers, cool fully unwrapped to avoid steam buildup making topping soggy. Reheat gently to preserve crust—microwaves sacrifice texture, an oven or toaster oven short blast preferred. Partial substitutions or missing ingredients? Extra sugar can be reduced slightly if fruit is overly sweet. Swap vanilla with almond extract for more nuttiness but lower quantity to avoid bitterness."
tips:
- "Use fresh stone fruits, really. Frozen works too but thaw and drain. Soggy bottoms ruin texture. Touch fruit till firm, not mushy."
- "A fluffy batter? Beat butter, almond paste, sugar long. Five minutes is key. Fluff state guarantees rise. Avoid shortcuts. Dense batter."
- "Resting is essential. Wait 20 minutes after baking. Let juices thicken naturally. Serve warm or cool off once rested. Texture unchanged."
- "Watch those bubbles. Juices signal readiness. Darker, thicker signifies success. Foil to prevent over-browning if needed. No burnt edges here."
- "Substitutions are possible. Extra butter can replace almond paste. Slightly different taste but richness stays. Use less regular salt if using."
faq:
- "q: What's a common issue for cobblers? a: Runny sauce can happen. Too much water from fruit. Drain properly before mixing ensure thick juice."
- "q: Can I save leftovers? a: Yes, cool unwrapped to avoid sogginess. Or try freezing for longer storage, but reheat carefully to keep texture."
- "q: How do I adjust sweetness? a: If fruit is overly sweet, cut back sugar. Balance is key, less is often more with sweet fruit."
- "q: What can I use instead of vanilla? a: Almond extract works well, use half. But be cautious. Strong flavor could overpower subtly."
