ingredients:
- "2 tablespoons avocado oil"
- "1 medium sweet onion diced"
- "3 garlic cloves minced"
- "2 serrano peppers diced finely"
- "3 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs"
- "1 ½ cups fire-roasted corn kernels"
- "14 ounce can white hominy drained"
- "1 15-ounce can black beans rinsed"
- "1 14 ½-ounce can diced tomatoes with green chilies"
- "4 cups low sodium chicken broth"
- "1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin"
- "1 teaspoon smoked paprika"
- "1 ½ teaspoons chili powder"
- "1 teaspoon dried oregano"
- "Salt to taste"
- "Fresh cracked black pepper"
instructions:
- "Heat oil in heavy pot over medium heat until shimmering but not smoking. Toss in diced onion, garlic, and serrano peppers. Stir occasionally, listen for soft sizzle. Cook until onions turn translucent and soften, about 6–7 minutes. Avoid browning, not caramelizing at this stage."
- "Nestle chicken thighs snugly at bottom of pot. Pour in broth, ensuring it submerges most of the protein for even poaching. Add tomatoes, hominy, black beans, and corn. Sprinkle cumin, paprika, chili powder, oregano with a pinch salt and some cracked black pepper. Stir carefully to combine without shredding raw meat yet."
- "Turn heat down to medium-low. Uncovered simmer, bubbles gentle but steady, allowing flavors to meld and chicken to cook through, 30 minutes max. Test chicken at 25-minute mark by prodding the thickest part; flesh should be opaque and firm but tender to fork."
- "Pull chicken thighs out with tongs onto plate. Using two forks, shred meat finely. Return shredded chicken to pot. Stir briskly to integrate meat evenly with broth and vegetables. Adjust seasoning here. If too thick, add splash of broth or water."
- "Simmer another 5 minutes to reheat shredded chicken and marry flavors further. Soup should thicken slightly and smell rich, smoky, with pepper heat balanced by earthy beans."
- "Serve hot. Garnish with crushed baked tortilla chips, crumbled cotija cheese, lime wedges squeezed generously, and chopped fresh cilantro leaves. Optional: dollop plain Greek yogurt for creaminess or sliced avocado for soothing contrast."
introduction: "Sharp, smoky, spicy, and hearty. Chicken thighs deliver better texture and stay juicy under heat longer than breasts—the kitchen truth you need. Corn, hominy, and black beans work like an all-star trio, giving this stew body and sweet pop. Serrano peppers punch up heat beyond jalapeño territory. The aroma of cumin and paprika sizzling with garlic and onions draws you close, teasing you before ladling warm comfort. Keep broth at gentle simmer—boiling toughens chicken and muddy flavors. Flexibility matters: substitute chicken thighs with breasts if lean required but reduce simmer time. All flavors deepen when given time, yet don’t overcook; mushy beans ruin the texture, so watch closely."
ingredientsNote: "Avocado oil preferable here—high smoke point keeps aromatics alive without burning garlic bitterness. If unavailable, light olive oil or grapeseed oil works. Serrano peppers sharper than jalapeños but manageable; scale heat by removing seeds or swapping with poblano for milder. Fire-roasted corn adds smoky notes missing if you grab frozen regular corn—don’t skip. Hominy is essential for that chewy, slightly nutty texture and a bit of starchiness; substitute canned white beans only if desperate but expect different mouthfeel. Chicken thighs offer flavor depth and moistness; breasts cook faster but dry easier. Fresh herbs last minute; cilantro adds brightness that cuts through smoky heaviness. Line of salt-shaker action unavoidable here—taste often, season gradually."
instructionsNote: "Start by softening onions and garlic. Their softened sugars unlock background sweetness, fundamental to balancing acidity and spice later. Medium heat avoids acrid burn. Serrano peppers release oil as they cook, think gentle hiss, giving more layers to spice beyond chili powders added at end. Nesting chicken thighs beneath liquid helps poach evenly and prevents drying out. Simmer uncovered to reduce, intensify broth, and let steam escape. Shredding warm chicken easier than cold—warm meat strands separate clean, absorb broth. Stirring shredded meat back in keeps soup unified; no separate protein chunks floating. Low and slow simmer post-shred binds flavors better than quick reheat. Garnishes add texture contrasts and brightness; crushed tortilla chips crackle against stew’s softness, lime juice wakes palate. Don’t skip fresh herbs or lime juice—it transforms the bowl. Pull pot off heat while adding delicate garnishes, letting them avoid wilting."
tips:
- "Searing aromatic base? Avoid browning. Keep heat medium. Listen for that gentle sizzle while garlic and onion soften. Essential for good flavor backdrop."
- "Want layers of spiciness? Adjust serrano heat. Remove seeds for milder kick or swap for poblano. Both options alter final punch. Flavor deepens with time."
- "Thicker soup? Add broth gradually. Or use water. Soup should be luscious, not a sludge. Watch texture, play with liquid amounts. Keep that balance."
- "Chicken too dried out? Avoid boiling; simmer gently. Tend to pot while it does its thing. Cover tightly if excess steam escapes. Safety net for juicy thighs."
- "Garnish crunch matters! Use crushed baked tortilla chips. Adds texture contrast against soft, hearty stew. A squeeze of lime brightens it up. Don't skip fresh cilantro."
faq:
- "q: How can I store leftovers? a: Refrigerate up to 3 days. Freezing works too. Soup splits a bit, but reheats well. Use microwave or stove for warming."
- "q: What if I can't find hominy? a: Substitute with canned white beans in a pinch. Texture's different though. Chewiness lost, but still okay flavor."
- "q: How to adjust for less heat? a: Swap serrano for sweet pepper. Flavor changes, heat drops significantly. Might need extra seasoning for balance."
- "q: Can I use chicken breasts instead? a: Yes, but reduce cooking time. Breasts dry out faster. Watch carefully near end. Thighs still add depth."
