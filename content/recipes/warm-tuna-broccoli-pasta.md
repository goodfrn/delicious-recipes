ingredients:
- "1 small head broccoli cut into small florets about 200 g"
- "200 g gemelli pasta or replace with penne"
- "1 can 180 g light tuna packed in water drained and flaked"
- "8 g chopped fresh parsley in place of coriander if preferred"
- "1/2 ml (1/8 teaspoon) crushed red chili flakes"
- "6 scallions thinly sliced, divide in half"
- "350 g cherry tomatoes halved"
- "25 ml extra virgin olive oil"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add broccoli and cook until just tender but still bright green about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Stir gently to avoid breaking. Immediately transfer broccoli using a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice water. This stops cooking and firms texture. Drain well and set aside."
- "Reheat the boiling water and add pasta. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Cook pasta until firm to bite al dente timing depends on brand usually 8 to 10 minutes. Drain pasta reserving 1/4 cup cooking water."
- "Meanwhile, heat olive oil in wide skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add remaining scallions and cherry tomatoes cut side down. Let tomatoes sizzle no stirring for 3 minutes until you hear soft popping sounds and skins start to split."
- "Turn heat to medium low and pour in about 3 tablespoons reserved pasta water. Let the mixture simmer gently uncovered 4 to 5 minutes until sauce thickens and coats spoon. Season sauce with salt pepper and chili flakes. Taste frequently to control heat and seasoning."
- "Add drained pasta directly to skillet with tomatoes. Toss to coat with sauce adding more pasta water if needed for gloss and fluidity. The pasta must glisten but not swim in liquid."
- "Remove pan from heat. Stir in blanched broccoli, tuna, and fresh parsley. Fold gently to combine without breaking tuna chunks or broccoli florets."
- "Adjust seasoning with salt pepper and extra chili if desired. Serve warm or slightly cooled. Garnish with remaining scallions if using."
introduction: "Quick warming pasta salad that’s more about layered textures and simple freshness than heavy sauce. Broccoli barely cooked so it maintains bite and vibrant color. Pasta al dente, tender but not soft, to hold shape after tossing. Tuna adds meaty contrast and umami punch without overpowering. Cherry tomatoes reduced in olive oil and scallions for lightly sweet slow-cooked depth. Chili brings faint heat, coriander or parsley gives a sharp herbal lift. Rely on your senses here more than the clock; bubbling tomato skins, the snap of broccoli when squeezed, glossy strands of pasta slicked with oil hint at readiness. Forget always precise minutes cooks. Watch the pan, feel the veggie."
ingredientsNote: "Substitute broccoli with cauliflower or blanched green beans if preferred. Can switch fresh coriander with Italian flat-leaf parsley for milder, less citrusy aroma. Tuna packed in water reduces oiliness but oil-packed adds richness if drained well. Cherry tomatoes must be ripe to provide natural sweetness when breaking down, else add a pinch of sugar during simmering to balance acidity. Use any short pasta shape like penne or gemelli to trap sauce efficiently. Olive oil quality matters more than quantity here; a grassy, peppery EVOO elevates final aroma. Divide scallions to add fresh crunch both cooked and raw layers."
instructionsNote: "Blanching broccoli is key to crisp texture and brilliant green. Do not skip ice bath; carries over cooking can turn broccoli mushy and dull. Cooking pasta in same water saves cleanup but do not over boil broccoli initially, test by piercing with fork; firm but tender. Tomato step smells deeply aromatic when edges soften and juice bubbles. Let tomatoes rest contacted with pan to coax flavor not a quick stir fry. Adding reserved pasta water adjusts sauce consistency and helps coat pasta with sheen. Folding cold tuna and broccoli last prevents breaking apart tuna texture, keeps broccoli from becoming soft. Season gradually; canned tuna often salty. Rest salad briefly before serving to marry flavors but avoid soggy pasta."
tips:
- "Blanching broccoli crucial for color. Cook 1-2 mins max. Ice bath to stop cooking. This keeps crunch, texture. Ignore timer; rely on visual cues. Vivid green means dial it down."
- "For pasta, al dente is key. Cook until firm. Stir often. Timing varies; check regularly after first 7 mins. Save 1/4 cup water for sauce. Helps bind. If sticky, add more pasta water."
- "Tomatoes need patience. Heat, let pop without stirring. Skins should blister. Bright aroma means it’s ready for phase two. Gradually add reserved pasta water to the mix for depth."
- "Tuna at end for chunky texture. Fold it in gently; don’t break apart. Fresh herbs sprinkled last adds zing. Salt needs to be added gradually, canned tuna could be salty already."
- "Extra virgin olive oil quality matters. A good brand can change final dish aroma. Not about quantity but nuance. If too oily, dish can drown. Taste balance often."
faq:
- "q: Can I sub pasta? a: Yes, any short pasta works. Penne or fusilli are solid choices. Try gluten-free versions. Just adjust cooking times accordingly."
- "q: What if my tomatoes aren’t sweet? a: Add a pinch of sugar while cooking. It balances out acidity. Ripe tomatoes are ideal though."
- "q: How long do leftovers last? a: Store in fridge 3 days max. Can adjust by adding olive oil again when rewarming. Prevents dryness, brings back gloss."
- "q: Can I add other veggies? a: Absolutely. Zucchini or green beans fit well too. Just blanch same way. Keep that crunch factor!"
