slug: "onion-soup-turkey-roast"
description: "Turkey roasted with dehydrated onion soup mix, white wine, and chicken broth. Wine adds fruitiness, broth keeps moist. Coating the bird in soup mix starts flavor and tenderizes skin. Cornstarch thickens pan sauce quickly to a glossy finish. Roasting slow, basting with broth keeps turkey juicy without messing with skin crispness. Substitutions: use dry mushroom soup if no onion mix; vegetable broth replaces chicken without loss in flavor balance. Rest bird to lock juices. Sauce simmers till sheen appears, coats spoon. Tactile and visual cues critical for doneness, moisture retention, sauce texture."

ingredients:
- "3 kg turkey (about 6 1/2 lb)"
- "1 1/2 sachets 20 g dehydrated onion soup mix"
- "250 ml dry white wine"
- "750 ml low-sodium chicken broth"
- "15 ml cornstarch (1 tbsp)"
- "45 ml cold water (3 tbsp)"
- "Vegetable oil for brushing"
instructions:
- "Set turkey breast-side up in large glass or ceramic dish."
- "Sprinkle onion soup evenly over skin, concentrate on breast to flavor and dry brine. Cover with plastic wrap, refrigerate 24 to 48 hours—not more or skin degrades."
- "Preheat oven to 175 °C (350 °F). Position rack in lower third to avoid overheating skin."
- "Transfer turkey to rack in roasting pan, tie legs securely with kitchen twine to maintain shape and even cooking."
- "Pour wine and 200 ml broth at base so dried onion bits settle there, aiding caramelization and flavor building. Brush skin lightly with oil to encourage browning."
- "Roast uncovered. Check internal temp after 1 hr 50 min using instant probe in thickest thigh muscle (avoid bone contact). Target 80 to 82 °C (176-180 °F). If under, continue with broth additions every 30 min to keep environment moist without steaming the skin."
- "Remove turkey. Tent loosely with foil; rest 20 minutes to redistribute juices preventing dry slices."
- "Strain pan juices into a saucepan, bring to vigorous boil—hear bubbling intensify, smell concentrated aroma richening. Mix cornstarch and cold water until slurry smooth."
- "Whisk slurry into boiling juices steadily. Sauce will thicken to satiny texture in 4-5 min. Adjust with pepper, taste for salt balance."
- "Serve sauce alongside carved turkey, pouring over just before eating to avoid soggy skin."
introduction: "Turkey is a beast to tame. Skin tough, meat prone to drying out. Use dried onion soup not as seasoning alone but as a brine of sorts—flavor plus moisture management. Wine and broth combo does the double duty: flavor and moisture. Roast low, slow yet watch temps not climb too fast or skin ruptures. Baste with broth evenly. Sauce thick with cornstarch, not flour—less dull, shines. Resting turkey crucial: proteins relax, juices settle. Sauce reduces to glossy finish; no gritty starch, no thin drippings. Go for smell, listen to bubbling, check the feel of the skin for crispness. No guessing. Practice, patience, results."
ingredientsNote: "Adjust quantities if bird smaller or bigger; roughly 60-70 g dried soup per kilo adds punch but dilutes if too much. If allergic or no onion soup, substitute with mushroom soup mix or mix dried thyme, garlic, onion powder, and celery salt for fresh flavor. Broth low sodium to control salt in final dish, prevents over-salting as soup mix already salty. White wine—dry, under 13% alcohol, enough acidity to cut through fat. If unavailable, dry vermouth or light sherry—less fruity but acceptable. Cornstarch for gluten-free thickening; can replace with arrowroot powder one-to-one, but add off heat to avoid cloudiness. Vegetable oil for skin brushing avoids burning butter notes."
instructionsNote: "Apply onion soup evenly, pressing gently with fingers to trap flavors into skin pores. Cover well in fridge to let flavors burrow but keep skin dry for crispness. Tie legs tight for compact shape aiding even cooking. Lower oven rack to protect turkey skin from overexposure to heating element—prevents burns. Baste with broth periodically every 30 minutes after initial roasting period only; too early basting cools skin, frustrates crisping. Internal temperature best indicator of doneness; thigh over breast site. Remove promptly after reaching temp, tent loosely to avoid steaming crust while resting. Strain pan juices to avoid burnt bits ruining sauce sheen. Slurry must be whisked briskly at moderate boil, otherwise sauce lumps. Sauce thickens visually: coats spoon, holds shape without runny drips. Add pepper last—black pepper powder oxidizes flavor when overheated. Always taste; soup mix and broth saltiness varies widely."
tips:
- "Onion soup mix; press gently into skin—trap flavors. Refrigerate 24-48 hours—don't skip this. Skin stays dry, crisp later. Low sodium broth; prevents too much salt."
- "Use instant probe thermometer. Check thickest thigh; avoid bones. Target temps; 80-82 °C or 176-180 °F. If undercooked; keep basting with broth every 30 minutes."
- "Tent turkey after roasting—20 minutes rest essential. Juices need redistribution. Helps slices stay moist—dry turkey, bitter end. No shortcuts here."
- "Cornstarch for sauce—quicker thickening without dullness. Mix with water till smooth. Whisk into boiling juices—quickly or lumps form. Look for glossy, coats spoon."
- "Adjust wine; use dry vermouth or sherry if no white wine. Same acidity needed. Watch for browning skin—oven rack prevents burning; protects turkey."
faq:
- "q: What's best internal temp for turkey? a: Aim for 80-82 °C; verify on thigh. Breast meat drier if too high—don't let it climb too fast."
- "q: Onion soup mix alternatives? a: Mushroom soup mix or garlic/onion powder for flavor. Blend—provide moisture as well. Be cautious with salt."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool down quickly. Refrigerate, airtight. Lasts 3-4 days. Freeze for longer; defrost in fridge later. Safe handling always."
- "q: Why is turkey dry sometimes? a: Temp too high; rush the cooking. Not enough initial seasoning. Observe skin; don't let it brown too fast."
