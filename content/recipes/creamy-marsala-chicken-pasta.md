ingredients:
- "1.5 pounds turkey breast cut into bite-size chunks"
- "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil"
- "10 ounces cremini mushrooms sliced"
- "1 medium yellow onion diced"
- "3 cloves garlic minced"
- "3 cups low sodium chicken broth"
- "1 cup oat milk"
- "3/4 cup dry sherry"
- "1 1/2 cups penne pasta"
- "1 teaspoon dried thyme"
- "1 teaspoon dried oregano"
- "Salt and ground black pepper to taste"
- "2 tablespoons cornstarch"
- "1/2 cup finely grated parmesan cheese"
- "2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley"
instructions:
- "Cut turkey breast into small, uniform pieces. Avoid uneven sizing; cooks unevenly otherwise."
- "Heat large heavy-bottom stockpot over medium-high flame. Add 2 Tbsp olive oil. Wait till shimmer, oil ripples but not smoking."
- "Add turkey chunks, season immediately with salt and pepper. Sear until no pink visible, edges starting golden. Don't crowd pan; cook in batches if needed. Remove turkey to plate."
- "Lower heat to medium; add final tablespoon olive oil. Toss in mushrooms, onions, garlic. Stir occasionally; listen to soft sizzling. Mushrooms will release liquid and shrink. Cook until onions translucent and mushrooms browned around edges, about 3-4 minutes."
- "Return turkey into pot, stir to combine."
- "Pour in chicken broth, oat milk, and dry sherry. Scrape bottom with wooden spoon to lift any brown bits—adds depth."
- "Add penne pasta, sprinkle thyme and oregano. Stir but don't overmix pasta; can get mushy."
- "Increase heat to bring to vigorous boil. Once boiling, cover with lid, reduce flame to low. Simmer gently, not aggressively, for 11-13 minutes. Check pasta edges for doneness; firm but no crunch. Stir carefully once mid-cook to prevent sticking."
- "Remove lid, mix cornstarch with small amount of cold oat milk until smooth. Pour slurry into pot stirring constantly. Heat up again to rolling boil for 6-8 minutes, sauce thickens noticeably. If still too thin, mix more slurry, add bit by bit—better thin than lumpy."
- "Remove from heat. Toss through parmesan cheese and parsley just before serving. Cheese melts into sauce; parsley brightens aroma and appearance."
- "Serve immediately. If sauce thickens too much upon standing, loosen with splash of broth or water before reheating gently."
introduction: "Turkey chunks seared to golden, locking juices. Mushrooms and onions sweat down, fill kitchen with earthy warmth. Throw in garlic—punchy aroma. Layer flavors by adding broth mixed with oat milk and dry sherry. Pasta cooks right in saucy bath—no separate pots or mess. Watch for bubbling, gentle simmer, lid on low flame. Thickness builds with cornstarch slurry; no glue, just velvety bound sauce. Parmesan adds salty richness, parsley crisp bite. Keeps clean-up simple. Swapped chicken to turkey for milder taste and leaner protein; dry sherry stands in well for Marsala at fraction cost. Heavy cream replaced with oat milk for lactose-friendly option without losing body. Uncomplicated yet fills plate with flavor and texture."
ingredientsNote: "Turkey breast works well thanks to mild flavor absorbing Marsala notes. Chicken can be used if preferred but watch for overcooking; turkey slightly firmer texture holds moisture longer. Dry sherry or even a good quality dry white wine replace Marsala in pinch—adjust sweetness by adding pinch of brown sugar if too dry. Oat milk keeps sauce creamy but lighter than heavy cream; full-fat coconut milk is option for dairy-free but shifts flavor. Olive oil is key—avoid heavy butter in the mushroom sauté stage to prevent burning; use good quality extra virgin for freshness. Cornstarch, not flour—gives glossy finish without floury taste. Fresh parmesan best grated fresh but pre-grated can substitute. Parsley optional but adds balance. If out of fresh, dried parsley sprinkled off heat works, but less bright."
instructionsNote: "Cut even pieces for uniform cooking; no guesswork on doneness. Searing chicken or turkey first creates Maillard reaction, sealing juices and flavor. Avoid overcrowding pan to prevent steaming—get true browning. Mushroom and onion step small but vital; releasing moisture slowly ensures taste foundation and no bitter burnt bits. Pasta added raw cooks directly in sauce—new technique to reduce pots and infuse starch thickening naturally. Watch boil intensity; too hot ruins pasta texture. Lid on low simmer traps heat evenly. Cornstarch slurry smooths texture but add slowly and stir constantly—prevent lumps. Let sauce come back to boil after adding slurry; heat activates thickening effect. Parmesan melted in off-heat preserves creaminess while parsley tossed last retains fresh aroma. If sauce thickens too much after resting, loosen with broth or water, reheat gently; never boil aggressively again or risk curdling oat milk substitute."
tips:
- "Cut turkey evenly. Size matters. Avoid uneven pieces. Aim for uniform cooking. Browning is key for flavor, seal juices."
- "Don't overcrowd pan when searing. Steam instead of brown if too crowded. Batch cook for perfect golden turkey chunks. Better texture."
- "For thick sauce, add cornstarch slowly. Mix with cold oat milk first. Stir constantly to prevent lumps. Heat until it bubbles."
- "Monitor pasta closely while cooking in sauce. Stir once mid-cook. Check for firm edges. Shouldn't be mushy. Lift lid carefully."
- "If sauce gets too thick while resting, loosen with splash of broth. Gently reheat until smooth again. Avoid aggressive heat."
faq:
- "q: Can I use chicken instead of turkey? a: Yes chicken works but watch cooking time; turkey stays moist longer."
- "q: What if I forget cornstarch? a: Sauce may thin out, won't coat pasta properly. Can use flour but not ideal; adjust liquid."
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. Last 3-4 days. Reheat gently; add water if too thick."
- "q: Can I substitute oat milk? a: Yes, heavy cream is alternative but shifts flavor. Full-fat coconut milk also works; adjust taste."
