ingredients:
- "1 leek white part only chopped"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tablespoons) olive oil"
- "1 parsnip peeled and diced"
- "500 g (5 cups) mixed chopped vegetables: select from zucchini, carrot, celery"
- "1 1/25 liters (about 5 cups) vegetable broth"
- "125 ml (1/2 cup) coconut milk"
- "pinch crushed red pepper flakes"
- "salt and pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Heat oil in large pot over medium heat. Add chopped leek, softening gently until translucent, about 5 minutes."
- "Toss in diced parsnip and other veggies, stir for 3 minutes. Pour in broth, bring to simmering boil."
- "Lower heat to medium-low, cook uncovered 35 minutes or until parsnip is tender but not mushy."
- "Remove pot from heat. Blend soup in batches until creamy and fully pureed. Return to pot."
- "Stir in coconut milk, add crushed red pepper flakes, season with salt and pepper to desired taste. Warm gently 5 minutes before serving."
introduction: "Vegetables gathering dust in the fridge. Do something with them. Leek replaces onion, olive oil swaps butter. Parsnip steps in for potato to add earthiness. Coconut milk softens edges, creating richness without eggs or dairy. Use any vegetables you can find, carrots, celery, zucchini—whatever's hiding at the back. Broth binds it all. The simmer is slower, patient. Blending is essential, no chunks allowed. Pepper flakes upfront, heat with control. Salt late, small increments. Serve in bowls, steaming, comforting but not heavy. Six servings—share around, because fridge empties but soup fills. Minimal fuss, maximum flexibility. Pure convenience. Break the monotony with texture and spice."
ingredientsNote: "Leek can be tricky, tender white part preferred for sweetness and mildness. Olive oil adds a fruity note, replacing butter's creaminess but reducing saturated fat. Parsnip chosen for its subtle sweetness and firm texture, works better than potato here for a unique flavor. Mixed vegetables bring complexity rather than repetition; carrots add sweetness, celery provides a slight bitterness, zucchini balances with freshness. Broth must be vegetable-based for vegan consistency, chicken would alter texture substantially. Coconut milk brings creaminess without dairy, replacing traditional butter or cream for those avoiding animal fat. Crushed red pepper flakes optional but recommended, they liven the palate. Salt carefully managed toward the end. Keep vegetable sizes uniform to ensure even cooking."
instructionsNote: "Heat control critical—start medium for leek to soften without browning. Sauté gently for about 5 minutes to coax out sweetness. Add parsnip and remaining veggies, stir for 3 minutes just to combine and awaken flavors. Pour broth cold from fridge, bring gently to boil, avoid rapid bubbles that toughen vegetables. Reduce heat immediately to medium-low, keep simmer steady but low to avoid overcooking and foam formation. Lengthened simmer by 5 minutes to achieve ideal tenderness for parsnip. Use immersion blender or countertop blender in batches for silky puree. Return to pot for finishing steps. Gently warm with coconut milk and seasoning for 5 minutes—you don’t want to boil after adding coconut milk; just heat. Adjust seasoning after blending; flavors intensify post-purée. Serve hot, maybe with crusty bread or herbs if lucky."
tips:
- "Use an immersion blender for smoother texture. No chunks allowed. This matters. Blend well in batches for creaminess. Pour the soup back to pot. Always check consistency. Warm gently after blending. Don't boil. Always better warm."
- "Chop veggies uniformly. Ensures even cooking. Adjust according to what you have. Carrots, zucchinis, or celery all work well. Remember, mix textures for depth. Stubborn roots take longer to soften. Keep an eye on them."
- "Simmering low is key. Start medium heat for leeks. Then reduce. Avoid overcooking. 35 minutes is ideal—check the parsnips. Tender without mush. The longer the simmer, the deeper the flavors. Patience pays off here."
- "Coconut milk adds creaminess. Replace dairy easily. Small amounts will soften flavors. Use full-fat for richness. Always add at the end. Heat gently. It can separate if boiled. Warm up slowly, avoid rapid changes."
- "Add crushed red pepper flakes. Optional but gives a nice kick. Start with a pinch—taste test afterward. Adjust seasoning gradually. Salt enhances flavors later. Remember to stir well. Blend before adding for an even mix."
faq:
- "q: How do I choose veggies? a: Pick what's about to go bad. Root veggies last. Zucchini's great for freshness. Carrots sweeten the mix. Any greens work, too. Tricky textures mix well. Explore combinations."
- "q: What if I don’t have coconut milk? a: Use another creamy substitute. Dairy creams can work. But ensure it aligns with diet. Almond milk, cashew cream—options abound. Adjust quantity for thickness."
- "q: Can I freeze the soup? a: Yes, cool completely first. Store in airtight containers. Keep up to three months. For easier reheating, portion out. Thaw overnight in fridge. Always tastes better freshly blended."
- "q: Why does it need to simmer so long? a: Flavor development takes time. Longer cooking releases natural sugars. Let them shine. Parshnip needs dedication to soften. Avoid stewing; keep watch. Patience ensures satisfaction."
