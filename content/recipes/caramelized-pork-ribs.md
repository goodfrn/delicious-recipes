Garlic and ginger punch under crisp tender broccoli and Brussels leaves sautéed with shallots and splash of Vietnamese dipping sauce. Slow bake covered to tender, uncover finish, syrupy sheen. Hot skillet cooks veggies fast, firm still. Substitute tamari for soy, honey for maple, chili garlic sauce for sriracha. Watch glaze carefully at end so sugars don’t burn. Serve with rice or on its own. Texture contrast key. Time flexible but watch meat softness and veggie crunch."

ingredients:
- "1 1/2 kg pork ribs trimmed"
- "100 ml hoisin sauce"
- "120 ml honey"
- "25 ml tamari sauce"
- "15 ml chili garlic sauce"
- "5 garlic cloves minced"
- "25 ml grated fresh ginger"
- "3 ml freshly ground black pepper"
- "2 shallots minced"
- "50 ml vegetable oil"
- "200 g finely sliced Brussels sprouts"
- "1 medium broccoli head cut into chunks"
- "30 ml Vietnamese dipping sauce nuoc cham"
instructions:
- "Position oven rack mid-level. Heat oven to 205 C 400 F; get that dry heat ready."
- "Slice pork ribs sharply through between each bone; easier to handle, better glaze coverage."
- "In baking dish roughly 33 x 23 cm, mix hoisin, honey, tamari, chili garlic sauce, garlic, ginger, pepper. Stir 'til wet paste, thick."
- "Add ribs, push to coat fully, flip pieces. Cover tightly with foil. Put in oven for about 1 hour, stirring gently at 30 minutes: check sauce absorption."
- "Foil off now. Flip ribs, bake another 25-35 minutes. Watch for sticky gloss to catch light and slight caramelized dark spots but not black. Meat tender sweep test with fork; it should peel easily but not fall apart."
- "Meanwhile heat pan on med-high. Oil in. Toss in shallots; sizzle, aromatics come up quick."
- "Throw Brussels and broccoli in right after. Stir fast for about 4 minutes, crisp-tender, veggies bright."
- "Splash nuoc cham, stir 2 more minutes. Should be lively, balance salt-sour, sheen coats vegetables well."
- "Serve ribs alongside greens. Rice optional but soaks up sauce well."
- "Taste glaze and veggies separately during final to adjust salt or acidity; ribs sweet-savory, greens tangy-spicy. Harmony from contrast."
introduction: "Ribs need time to soften but watch heat so they don’t dry. Slow oven, covered creates steam, moisture traps in meat. The glaze builds during uncovered finish, sugars break down to syrup thickness. That balance is crucial — too much heat burns sugars bitter, too little and ribs flop with raw sauce. Braising then glazing approach. Vegetables—Brussels and broccoli—quick pan-fried till edge crisp, still snap inside. Shallow cooking locks color, texture, flavor. Using a punchy nuoc cham finish layers flavor complexity. That’s where acidity and salt kick in to cut the sticky fat. No dairy no nuts, just bold savory umami, sweet heat and fresh green crunch. Save yourself from soggy greens by cooking them fast then adding acidity at the end. Ribs and greens serve as a meal or side easily, versatile adaptable. Substitutions ready if pantry gaps arise."
ingredientsNote: "Switched out half of maple for honey—honey caramelizes slightly quicker and deepens color without overpowering sweet. Used tamari instead of soy sauce for gluten-free option; brings mellow salt punch without bitterness. Chili garlic sauce replaces sriracha for bright garlic heat that cooks down smooth. Pay attention to the quality of hoisin; not all are equal—sweetness varies, adjust honey accordingly. Fresh ginger critical—dry powder won’t cut sharp in temp. Shallots over onion: better aromatic and texture for quick sauté without overpowering dish. Prepping ribs: cutting between bones saves carving later, maximizes glaze surface. Brussels sprout thin slicing crucial or they feel tough; broccoli chopped coarse for textural contrast. Store-bought nuoc cham is fine; homemade recommended for fresher balanced acids and fish sauce depth. Oil neutral; vegetable or canola works well, avoid heavy flavors that mask delicacy."
instructionsNote: "Prep first: ribs sliced, marinade mixed ready to go. Helps timing and coats ribs evenly. When covered cook, steam forms inside foil, tenderizing meat while glaze seeps in. Stirring halfway stops ribs from sticking or drying on one side. Removing foil exposes racks to dry heat; sugars start caramelizing—use visual cues, ribs glossy and just a little sticky, glove finger touch: flexible not falling apart. Avoid burning! If glaze darkens too fast, reduce heat or cover loosely with foil. Pan for veggies must be hot before adding oil; oil heats quickly turning shiny but not smoking. Add shallots, listen to quick sputter — that’s aromatics awakening. Toss in greens, keep mixture moving constantly to prevent scorching. The 2-minute finish with nuoc cham seals freshness and roundness into greens. Taste and adjust acid or salt here. Serve immediately. Don’t let greens sit or they turn limp. Rice is a backup; keep simple steamed jasmine or basmati to focus on ribs and greens. Efficiency tip: assemble marinade while ribs slice. Saves time when oven is ready."
tips:
- "Marinade should cling tightly to ribs; too loose, it fails. Coat well. Foil traps moisture—steam helps meat; avoids drying. Cook long, watch doneness."
- "Glaze caramelization needs attention. Too high heat, sugars darken fast, bitter. Use visual cues: glossy look, slight stickiness. Adjust temp if needed. Patience is key."
- "Veggies require fast cooking; pan must be hot. Toss shallots, listen for sizzle; aromatics wake up. Add greens immediately—it’s a quick sauté, no mushy. Stir constantly."
- "Nuoc cham adds acidity—balance sweet ribs. Drizzle over veggies after cooking; seals texture, flavor. Don't skip this step. Elevates the dish without fuss."
- "If ribs tough post-cook time, cover, extend by 10-minute bursts. Check regularly. Don’t let uncooperative ribs ruin your meal! Adjust heat further if necessary."
faq:
- "q: How do I know ribs are done? a: Fork test—should pry easily from bone. But not fall apart. Look for shine; sticky surface means done. Watch your time."
- "q: What to do with tough vegetables? a: Quick sauté needed. Timing matters, veggies can turn mushy. If too tough, slice thinner, shorter cooking next time."
- "q: Storing leftovers? a: Keep in airtight. Ribs last 3-4 days. For greens, shorter time; keep crispness, revive in pan. Revive with water splash if needed."
- "q: Can I swap hoisin sauce? a: Yes, use teriyaki or make homemade if pantry is bare. Flavor varies; adjust honey for sweetness balance. Consider using coconut aminos."
