ingredients:
- "1 batch pizza dough divided into 4"
- "200 ml crème fraîche"
- "1 medium red onion, thinly sliced"
- "3 green onions, chopped"
- "30 ml flat leaf parsley, chopped"
- "15 ml dill, chopped"
- "5 ml fresh thyme leaves"
- "5 ml lemon zest"
- "150 g North Atlantic shrimp, drained"
- "Olive oil for drizzling"
instructions:
- "Heat pizza stone on grill set to very high heat for 15 minutes before cooking."
- "Divide pizza dough into four equal parts. On a lightly floured surface, roll each piece into a thin disk roughly 25 cm in diameter. Place each disk on parchment paper."
- "Spread each dough disk with 50 ml crème fraîche. Distribute sliced red onion evenly on top. Season with pepper."
- "Place parchment with pizza onto the hot pizza stone on the grill. Close lid and cook 10 to 12 minutes until crust turns golden and crisp."
- "While pizzas cook, mix green onions, parsley, dill, thyme, and lemon zest in a bowl."
- "Remove pizzas from grill. Top each with quarter of the herb mix, then spread shrimp evenly on top."
- "Drizzle olive oil over each pizza before serving."
introduction: "Seafood on pizza. Not typical. Thin crust. Quick cook time. Grill heat and stone. Sharp red onion in place of sweet. Herbs play the lead. Dill swapped basil. Lemon zest cuts richness. Shrimp washed and ready, fresh from cold waters. Creamy base but less, for balance. Olive oil drizzled last, to finish. Four pizzas from one dough batch. The heat, the stone, the smoky grill aroma. The herbs piled high post bake, warm and wilting just slightly. Simplicity, freshness, quick- no fuss."
ingredientsNote: "Using red onion instead of a small yellow onion adds a mild sharpness, providing a contrasting bite to the cream. The green onions keep their delicate crispness and freshness while mixing with flat leaf parsley and dill, which gives a lighter, herbaceous flavor shift from the original basil. A splash of lemon zest lifts the herbs, cutting through cream's richness. Shrimp quantity reduced marginally but still plenty. Oil drizzle at the end keeps the flavor delicate and fresh without weighing down the crust. Pizza dough remains classic thin crust, easier to handle on the grill and crisp when baked on stone."
instructionsNote: "Preheat the grill with pizza stone to ensure a very hot surface for the dough, leading to crisp edges and a properly cooked base. Rolling the dough thin helps it cook evenly and quickly. Spread crème fraîche sparingly but evenly or it sogs the dough. Red onion slices placed before cooking soften and sweeten slightly but retain a bit of texture. Cook times adjusted five minutes longer to ensure thorough baking with the thicker red onion. After cooking, fresh herbs added last to keep brightness, followed by chilled shrimp which warms just from residual heat. Olive oil drizzled last adds glossy finish and mouthfeel without needing cheese or heavy sauces. Overall steps simplified and reordered for better timing and texture contrast."
tips:
- "Grill's hot? Preheat stone. Fifteen minutes on high heat is best. No half measures. Crisp edges are key. Pizza dough rolled thin. Helps cook fast. Golden crust is the goal. Watch it."
- "Use a parchment. Keeps the dough from sticking. Simplifies transfer. Pull it right off to the hot stone. Easy to handle, right? Crème fraîche isn’t a lot, just a smear, or it can weigh down."
- "Shrimp on pizzas? Drain well first. No excess moisture please. Red onion adds bite. Sauté lightly for a softer version if you prefer. The fresh herbs? Added afterward. Keeps them bright, not cooked."
- "Lemon zest lifts flavors. Use freshly grated. Not too much, just a hint. Olive oil drizzle at end? Essential. Adds a finishing touch. Glossy sheen, delicate richness."
- "Don't forget the herb mix. Green onions add crispness. Parsley and dill? Perfect for light flavor. Mix it in a bowl. Toss gently. Colorful and fresh. Adds depth after baking."
faq:
- "q: What if my pizza dough is too sticky? a: Flour a surface, and hands. Roll gently. Pat down lightly. Don't work it too much. Better control with flour."
- "q: Can I use different seafood? a: Yes, absolutely. Scallops, even fish. Adjust cooking times. Larger pieces? Cook longer. Nice variety though."
- "q: What’s the best way to store leftover pizza? a: Wrap with plastic. Fridge works best. Reheat in an oven. Crust stays crisp, flavors intact."
- "q: Can I make the dough ahead? a: Yes. Store in fridge. Up to two days max. Freeze for longer. Just thaw overnight in the fridge."
