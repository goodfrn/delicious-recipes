ingredients:
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) Greek yogurt plain"
- "25 ml (1 2/3 tbsp) honey"
- "3 ml (3/4 tsp) smoked paprika"
- "2 ml (1/2 tsp) cayenne pepper"
- "1 ml (1/4 tsp) garlic powder"
- "1 ml (1/4 tsp) ground coriander"
- "500 ml (2 cups) mixed nuts (pecans, walnuts, Brazil nuts, lightly salted cashews)"
- "1 ml (1/4 tsp) kosher salt"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven at 140°C (285°F). Line tray with parchment. Avoid higher temps; nuts scorch easily at usual 150°C."
- "In bowl, whisk Greek yogurt with honey and all spices until fully combined. Greek yogurt gives creaminess and tang, acting as binder without adding oil."
- "Toss nuts in the glaze, distributing evenly so every piece gets coated but not soaked, excess shrinks through roasting."
- "Scatter nuts in single layer on prepared sheet. Don’t overcrowd; air must circulate. Else uneven roasting."
- "Roast for about 25-30 minutes. Stir every 7 minutes, scraping nuts off parchment and flipping to expose all sides. Look for color deepening, aroma shifting to toasted, spicy-sweet mix. If edges get dark before center, reduce heat or stir more frequently."
- "Remove from oven while nuts still slightly glossy—not dry or cracked. Residual heat continues cooking, ensures crunchiness, avoids bitterness from over-roasting."
- "Immediately sprinkle kosher salt; the coarse crystals latch onto warm nuts, enhancing layers of flavor."
- "Cool fully on sheet or wire rack. Texture firm, sound of cracking nuts under teeth tells you they’re ready."
- "Store airtight at room temp for up to 2 weeks."
- "Substitutions: Greek yogurt can yield to sour cream but thinner consistency. Honey replaced with maple syrup for vegan option. Ground coriander provides earthiness, swap with cumin if unavailable but lose citrus notes."
- "Common pitfalls: overheating leads to bitter burnt taste. Too little stirring causes uneven roasting. Over-glazing gums nuts together, do light coats."
- "Use this mix to add crunch on salads, rice bowls, or simply snack straight from jar."
introduction: "Spicy nuts. Crunch and aroma shaking the kitchen. Forget just dump and bake. Coat ’em right with tangy yogurt blended with honey for subtle sweetness, smoke from paprika creeping in. The mix isn’t your classic mix — pecans swapped with walnuts, salted cashews instead of raw, Brazil nuts included for their creamy softness. Roast low and slow, 140 degrees rather than usual 150. Keeps nuts from burning their oils and bitterness rising. Stir every seven minutes. Smell tells when heading close to done. Mouthfeel should snap under teeth, spice lingers on tongue, balanced with sweet sticky glaze. Salt after roasting, never before — salt pulls out moisture and can stall crisping if added too soon. Store airtight. Keeps well for weeks if done right. Perfect for last-minute add-ons to salads, grain bowls or cocktail hour nibbles."
ingredientsNote: "Greek yogurt replaces mayo — not only lowers fat but adds slight acidity that plays with spices. Honey swaps out maple syrup, giving a different sweetness layer. Smoked paprika brings smokiness absent with plain paprika. Ground coriander replaces piment de la Jamaïque (allspice) to add earth and citrus hints familiar but different. Nuts are key. Pecans and walnuts offer contrasting textures. Brazil nuts smooth, butter-like. Lightly salted cashews introduce subtle salt and creaminess, a balance to the spices. Use kosher salt after roasting to ensure the coating stays crisp, never soggy. Substitutions are straightforward but note texture and flavor differences. You can use raw nuts, but salted ones add complexity. Paprika must be smoked, else you lose one flavor dimension. For dairy-free, substitute Greek yogurt with coconut yogurt, watch moisture content. If honey isn’t available, agave syrup is a decent replacement, neutral sweetness. Mischief happens when nuts crowded; air circulation prevents steaming, helps crisp edge formation."
instructionsNote: "Low moderate roasting temperature crucial. High heat scorches nuts, ruptures fragile oil cells releasing bitterness. Even coating lets spices cling without clumping. Greek yogurt mix helps, but avoid excess; thin glaze ensures nuts don’t steam in oven. Stirring at intervals critical: watch for aromas deepening, nuts changing color, no sudden dark spots. Pull out before nuts appear dry or cracked — residual heat finishes crisping. Adding salt only post-roast prevents moisture pull that slows crisp texture. Cooling on parchment or wire rack impacts final crunch. Use baking sheet edges to scrape nuts off parchment if sticks. Store in airtight containers once cooled to maintain crunch. Common mistake: over-glazing leads to sticky clusters rather than individual nuts. Use minimal coating, shake off excess. If nuts over-toast, bitterness develops, hard to mask. Lower oven temperature. Adjust timing by sight, smell, texture rather than strict schedule."
tips:
- "Monitor aroma, look for deepening color as nuts roast. Stir every 7 min, avoid scorching. Mix should coat lightly; too much leads to clumping."
- "Check texture, crunch should be present when fresh. Glossy finish indicates readiness; pull before they dry out completely. Salt only after roasting."
- "Cooling on tray crucial. Hardens texture, prevents sogginess. Use wire rack for even better airflow. Sticking? Use tray edges to dislodge nuts gently."
- "Greek yogurt can swap for sour cream, adjust thickness. Maple syrup works in place of honey but alters sweetness depth. Experiment to find fit."
- "Control oven temperature closely. High heat scorches oils, bitterness arises. Always adjust timing based on visual and olfactory cues not just clock."
faq:
- "q: What if nuts appear burnt? a: Pull them out early. Smell guides timing. Colors shouldn't be too dark. Reduce heat next time, stir more."
- "q: Can I use raw nuts? a: Yes, but salt is key for balancing. Raw nuts will yield different crunch. Experiment but adjust spices accordingly."
- "q: How to store the nut mix? a: Keep in airtight container at room temp, up to 2 weeks. Refrigerate for longer life, but humidity can change texture."
- "q: What’s a common mistake? a: Over-glazing leads to clusters; not coating evenly. Stir frequently for even roasting. Soggy nuts require adjustments."
