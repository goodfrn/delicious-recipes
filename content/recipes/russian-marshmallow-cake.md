description: "A layered cake with a light sponge, a fluffy marshmallow center made using gelatin and condensed milk, topped with a silky chocolate glaze. Modified ingredient amounts with a hint of orange zest in the marshmallow. Baking and chilling times adjusted for texture. Uses rice flour instead of all-purpose for a delicate crumb. The marshmallow has a bit of vanilla replacement with almond extract. A balance of sweetness and slight citrus zing. The cocoa glaze slightly tweaked with espresso powder for depth."

instructions:
- "=== Cake ==="
- "Preheat oven to 175°C (350°F). Grease and line 20 cm (8 inch) springform pan with parchment paper."
- "Mix rice flour and baking powder together in a bowl."
- "Whisk egg yolks, whole egg, and sugar with electric mixer until thick and pale, about 8 minutes. Slowly pour in oil while mixing gently."
- "Fold in flour mixture with spatula until incorporated but not overmixed."
- "Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake 18 to 22 minutes or until toothpick inserted comes out clean. Cool slightly."
- "=== Marshmallow ==="
- "Combine condensed milk and butter in small bowl; set aside."
- "Sprinkle gelatin over cold water; let bloom for 7 minutes."
- "Add egg whites to gelatin and whisk gently just to combine."
- "In small saucepan, heat sugar and water to boiling. Remove at 117°C (243°F) on candy thermometer."
- "Slowly pour hot syrup into egg white mixture, whisking at medium-high speed continuously."
- "Whip for 7 to 9 minutes until marshmallow is thick, warm, holds shape semi-firmly."
- "Fold in condensed milk mixture, almond extract, and orange zest with gentle spatula strokes."
- "Spread marshmallow topping evenly over cake layer. Refrigerate 1 hour 50 minutes to set."
- "=== Cocoa glaze ==="
- "In small saucepan, combine powdered sugar, butter, cocoa powder, milk, and espresso powder."
- "Heat gently until boiling, whisking constantly. Simmer 2 minutes, continue whisking."
- "Remove from heat, let cool 6 minutes to thicken slightly."
- "Remove chilled cake from pan. Quickly spread glaze on top, letting edges drip. Refrigerate 25 to 35 minutes until glaze firms."
- "Use sharp knife dipped in hot water to slice cleanly."
introduction: "Some cake batter. Egg yolks whipped high. Rice flour swapped for lighter texture. Oil drizzled slowly. Quick bake. Marshmallow made unconventional. Gelatin swelling in water, warmth, sugar syrup hitting perfect temp. Whisking till glossy, fluff stays. Almond extract twigs in. Citrus zest sneaks sharpness. Condensed milk joins for richness. Layer marshmallow like clouds above sponge. Refrigerate patiently. Cocoa glaze not ordinary—espresso behind the scenes deepening flavors. Heat mixture then cool. Pour before setting and let gravity do work on edges. Chill again, slice hot knife but no mess. Textures blend, sweet with hints of orange and bitter cocoa. Simple but different."
ingredientsNote: "Rice flour acts lighter than usual flour, bringing slight chew and fluffiness. Baking powder unchanged, keeps rise. Oils can shift texture; canola chosen neutral. Almond extract whispers nutty hint, replacing vanilla, less dominant. Orange zest adds vibrant citrus cut through the sugar. Gelatin needs precise water absorption; exact timing important for gelling. Sugar syrup at specific temperature critical to avoid grainy marshmallow. Espresso bit in glaze lifts cocoa, lowers cloying sugar feeling. Butter softened not melted keeps gloss and sheen in glaze. Milk balances thickness, adding creaminess without heaviness."
instructionsNote: "Always bloom gelatin fully; skip this step marshmallow falters. Sugar syrup temp off by 2 degrees changes final texture noticeably. Whisk speed matters; too low marshmallow limp, too high can overshoot. Adding citrus zest last preserves aroma. Marshmallow must be spread warm but not hot or it melts cake. Chill time slight adjustment from norm; 1hr 50min ensures setting without drying. Glaze simmer not boil hard; 2 min simmer lets cocoa infuse. Pour glaze quickly then smooth fast to get edges dripping mess, that desired rustic look. Hot water knife crucial for clean slices, less dragging through thick marshmallow."
tips:
- "Gelatin is a must. Bloom properly or marshmallow won’t set right. Water temp should stay cool. Bloom for at least 7 minutes. If too short, texture ruins."
- "Sugar syrup needs precision. If off by just 2 degrees, marshmallow fails. Use a candy thermometer. Pour hot syrup in a steady stream while whisking. It combines well."
- "Refrigeration time matters. Don’t rush chilling the marshmallow layer. A cool hour 50 minutes for proper firmness. Too little time means messiness when slicing."
- "Glaze is fussy. Make sure to whisk constantly while you heat. Let it simmer not boil. Two minutes should do. If you boil hard, cocoa might burn."
- "A sharp knife and hot water are key. They help in slicing through marshmallow without dragging. Clean cuts mean nicer presentation. Keep knife hot and clean."
faq:
- "q: How long can I store the cake? a: Store covered in fridge. Lasts about 3-5 days. Make sure it’s airtight. Otherwise, marshmallow dries out fast."
- "q: Can I use another type of flour? a: You can try but results vary. Rice flour provides that delicate texture. Alternatives may alter crumb and consistency."
- "q: What if my marshmallow mixture isn’t thick enough? a: First check gelatin bloom. Then verify sugar syrup temp. If still weak, re-whip a bit longer."
- "q: How to reheat the glaze if it hardens? a: Gently heat on low. Add a splash of milk, if needed. Whisk until smooth again. Avoid overheating."
