ingredients:
- "3 scallions, roughly chopped"
- "2 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped"
- "½ serrano chili, seeded and chopped"
- "1 large avocado, peeled and pitted"
- "1 cup fresh cilantro packed"
- "3 tablespoons fresh lime juice"
- "5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil"
- "Sea salt to taste"
- "Fresh cracked black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Pulse scallions, garlic, and serrano in food processor until finely chopped but not pureed; small bits still visible—texture matters here."
- "Add cilantro and pulse a few times, barely breaking leaves down to preserve bright green flecks."
- "Drop in avocado and lime juice; blend just until creamy with some texture, scraping sides as needed to keep everything moving."
- "Drizzle in olive oil slowly while running processor to emulsify sauce lightly; don’t overblend or it’ll get mushy and over-warm."
- "Taste, season with salt and fresh pepper, adjust lime juice if needed; final sauce vibrant, silky, but not watery."
- "Serve immediately or store cold, best within 24 hours; color dulls with time, acid helps preserve but not forever."
introduction: "Forget long cooking. Immediate punch. The base: scallions over typical green onions. Sweeter, milder, less fibrous noise. Serrano swaps jalapeño—heat sharper, fresher. Avocado adds cream that olive oil alone can’t deliver—mouthfeel silkier, body richer without cooking. Crucial to keep chopped bits visible, not a green puree mess. Fresh lime juice cuts richness, lifts flavors, brightens color. All raw, no time wasted, craft sauce while grill preheats. Sauce like this demands top herbs; wilted cilantro kills vibrance—discard limp, smells off. Splash of olive oil last avoids greasiness; blending textures, tastes, temperatures key. Don’t skip salt, brings all alive. Bottle fridge life minimal, no preservatives."
ingredientsNote: "Scallions replace green onions for a tender bite; their white parts pack less sharp sulfur punch. Serrano chili instead of jalapeño—spicier brisk heat, less grassy bitterness. Avocado smooths, preventing oily slick and adds body. If allergic or avoiding avocado, use 1 tablespoon tahini for earthiness or nut-free almond butter—texture shifts but richness remains. Fresh lime juice mandatory, dried or bottled juice flattens brightness. Olive oil quality critical; poor oil ruins. Salt brings out subtle flavors; season gradually, taste often— too much masks nuances. Garlic chopped chunky to prevent overpowering raw punch — slow raw warming brings mellow garlic bite. Cilantro must be fresh, bright, no discoloration—picker’s nose test. No cooking steps streamline prep, maintain fresh herb fragrance. Prep all ingredients chilled; warmer produce dulls vividness and speed of oxidation."
instructionsNote: "Chop first three main aromatics coarsely but uniformly for even pulse grinding without turning mush. Short bursts prevent overprocessing; leave small bits for texture contrast in finished sauce. Adding cilantro last keeps herb flavors distinct, avoids gumminess from total purée. Incorporate avocado and lime juice next, blending just long enough to emulsify without losing creamy texture or warming sauce—a short run pulse, not continuous blending. Slowly stream olive oil while running processor to create a light emulsion—too fast and it might separate; too slow and oil incorporation is patchy, oily spots appear. Salt and pepper come last, essential seasoning balance—salt opens citrus and herb notes, pepper enhances layered heat. Use spatula to taste between adjustments. Ready when sauce clings lightly to spoon, vibrant green with flecks visible. Store airtight in fridge; separate water layer may form—stir gently before serving. Avoid metal bowls or utensils to preserve color and freshness."
tips:
- "Scallions offer milder onion taste; chop them well but don’t pulverize. They add sweetness. Texture counts here. Keep some visible."
- "Serrano chili’s sharper heat lifts flavors. Adjust depending on spice tolerance. Adding more? Be cautious. It can overshadow."
- "Processing technique is key; short bursts keep texture. Don’t overblend or you risk losing that vibrant color and fresh feel."
- "Avocado texture crucial; if you skip it, sauce becomes oily. Tahini might work but changes flavor. Use it for more earthiness."
- "Always taste during prep—salt brightens every element, enhances lime and herbs; don’t rush seasoning. Balance is essential."
faq:
- "q: How to store this sauce? a: Airtight container is best. Keep cold. Consume within 24 hours for bright color."
- "q: What if I need it spicier? a: Add more serrano chili. Start little; taste as you go. Balance important."
- "q: Can I make it ahead? a: Yes, prep hours ahead. Best fresh though. Flavor fades over time."
- "q: Substitutes for avocado? a: Use tahini or nut butter. Texture will differ but richness remains. Keep in mind creaminess."
