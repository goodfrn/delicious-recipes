slug: "crispy-hazelnut-roll"
description: "Rice cereal combined with melted marshmallows, swapped hazelnut spread for almond butter, fresh raspberries replacing strawberries. Butter reduced by 20%. Rolled thin on plastic wrap to keep shape. Chill before slicing to firm up. Topped with drizzled warmed almond butter for contrast. Gluten-free, lactose-free, no eggs. Textures balance sticky marshmallow base, crunchy cereal, tart raspberry bursts. Simple assembly, watch marshmallow melting to avoid scorching. Use almond butter if hazelnut allergy or to change flavor profile. Prep steps shuffled to highlight texture control and timing adjustments."

ingredients:
- "48 ml (3 tbsp) unsalted butter"
- "1 sac 250 g (1/2 lb) white marshmallows"
- "1.2 litres (5 cups) rice cereal (gluten-free)"
- "375 ml (1 1/2 cups) almond butter, smooth"
- "400 ml (1 2/3 cups) fresh raspberries, gently sliced"
instructions:
- "Prepare a 43 x 30 cm (17 x 12 in) sheet pan by lightly oiling it and lining with plastic wrap. Moisten wrap slightly — it stops sticking but stay light-handed."
- "In a big pot over medium heat, melt butter slowly. Watch carefully — butter foam and crackle signal it's hot. Toss in marshmallows, stir with heat-resistant spatula, stirring steadily until fully melted. Look for glossy texture, no lumps. If sticking or browning too fast, reduce heat immediately."
- "Off the heat, dump all rice cereal into the pot. Stir firmly but fast — want cereal coated evenly before marshmallow cools and stiffens. Concentrate on folding cereal in without crushing it. Texture integrity is key."
- "Then, with buttered hands (prevents sticky mess), transfer mixture onto plastic-lined pan. Press down evenly but don’t smash too dense. Aim for uniform thickness about 1.5 cm (1/2 in). Let sit at room temp for 25 to 35 minutes until just firm but still pliable — test by pressing lightly, should bounce back without sticking."
- "Spread 300 ml (1 1/4 cups) almond butter over surface, leaving edges bare for easier rolling. Dot thinly sliced raspberries evenly atop almond butter layer. Use fresh raspberries; frozen or wet will sog the base."
- "Using the plastic wrap edges, roll gently starting from the short side, pulling wrap to create tight roll but avoid crushing fruit inside. Plastic wrap keeps roll tight and neat. Place sealed roll on a rectangular plate."
- "Warm leftover almond butter gently in double boiler or microwave in 15-second bursts until pourable but not hot—should hold viscous drip. Drizzle over roll in thin streams for visual appeal and flavor boost."
- "Serve same day for best texture contrast. If temperature creeps over 22C (70F), refrigerate wrapped but accept slightly harder texture. To re-soften, let sit 15 minutes at room temp before slicing."
- "Slice with a sharp serrated knife, sawing gently to prevent squashing the roll."
introduction: "Sticky marshmallow glue bubbling quietly over the butter’s heat. Marshmallow melting is that soft mirror surface, slowly becoming pliable lava you don’t want burning or lumpy. Rice cereal folds in – fragile, light, needs a gentle touch. Resist crushing it or sogging it. The roll gets shaped onto plastic wrap—grease your fingers, keep the stickiness at bay. Spread almond butter evenly, thick enough to hold fruit but won’t squeeze out when rolling. Raspberries add welcome sharpness and moisture, sliced paper-thin, pressed lightly but left whole. Roll tight, keep form. Drizzle more almond butter warmed to drizzle, not drown. Serve fresh, or chill slightly if warm kitchen threatens to soften it too far. A balance of textures — sticky, crunchy, tart. No eggs, gluten-free, lactose-free. Simple swaps that keep kitchen frustration low but flavor interesting."
ingredientsNote: "Butter reduced slightly to avoid overly greasy stickiness. Marshmallows stay white but watch carefully melting times, burnt sugar ruins taste fast. Rice cereal should be fresh and crisp—stale cereal clumps, breaks less attractively. Replace Nutella with almond butter for allergen swap and lighter flavor, less oily. Raspberries hold moisture better than strawberries, avoid mushiness. Plastic wrap lining is key to rolling cleanly — oil it lightly or stickiness ruins the roll’s shape. Sometimes store-bought almond butter separates; stir well before use for even consistency. If almond butter too stiff, warm gently before spreading to avoid tearing the base. Keep ingredients measured accurately—too much marshmallow makes roll sticky and heavy. Archiving method is soft chilling, not freezing, because hard freezing crackers crumbly texture."
instructionsNote: "Butter melts best on medium low to avoid brown bits, which alter flavor negatively. Melt marshmallows gently, no lumps or burning edges — that’s the sign you’re rushing. Stirring fast when adding cereal avoids clumps or uneven spots. Buttered hands are essential — otherwise, sticky marshmallow mixture sticks everywhere, slows production. Pressing evenly and quickly onto plastic wrap preserves the cereal’s crisp profile without squashing it. Let the base cool until it yields slightly to touch—not sticky, not fully firm. Spread almond butter with an offset spatula for control — prevents tearing cereal base. Roll tightly but slowly, use the cling film to help. Warm leftover almond butter in a double boiler or microwave short bursts, no overheating — too hot and it becomes too runny or oily on roll surface. Slicing serrated knife gently—don’t press hard or roll flattens. Store rolled dessert in fridge only if air temperature threatens meltdown. Bring to room temperature before slicing for easier cuts."
tips:
- "Temperature matters; butter should be melted slowly. Medium heat always. Watch for bubbling; if it foams too much, lower heat. Marshmallows, they need careful melting. No lumps, no burning. Stir constantly for glossy texture, avoid scorching."
- "Press evenly when shaping roll. Too dense? No good. Aim for even thickness around 1.5 cm. If too soft after cooling, it’ll squeeze out filling when rolled. Check firm but pliable texture by lightly pressing."
- "Almond butter substitutions can affect flavor and texture. Nut allergies, use seed butter. If almond butter is too stiff, warm gently before spreading—don’t tear the base layer. Cool it right, that’s how you keep crunch."
- "Use fresh raspberries only. Frozen makes a soggy mess, not the right balance. Thickness matters; slice them thin. Dot them evenly on the almond butter — don’t overload. Roll tightly but don’t crush."
- "Store wrapped roll, only if kitchen too warm. Best at room temp. When cutting, use a serrated knife. Saw gently, don’t squash. Freshness key, keep it crisp. Warm kitchen means chilling — balance texture."
faq:
- "q: How do I fix a sticky mess? a: If mix is too wet, add more rice cereal gradually. Need crunch balance. Too cool? Warm it slightly. Heat makes it easier to handle."
- "q: What if I don’t have almond butter? a: Could swap with sunflower seed butter, maybe peanut but deeper flavor. Viscosity might differ; adjust spreading method."
- "q: Can I make this ahead? a: Yes, but best served fresh. Refridge only if heat levels are high. Check before slicing. Re-soften at room temp, not too long though."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep in airtight container for a couple days. Refrigerate if it gets too warm out. But beware, textures differ after chilling. Just know that."
