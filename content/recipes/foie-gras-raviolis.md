ingredients:
- "140 ml (about 2/3 cup) cooked mashed sweet potatoes packed firmly"
- "90 g fresh foie gras or duck liver terrine"
- "20 won-ton wrappers"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) clarified butter or grapeseed oil"
- "60 ml veal demi-glace or rich chicken stock"
- "60 ml Muscat wine Beaumes de Venise or dry white muscat"
- "140 ml seeded golden raisins halved"
- "Salt and pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Start by mixing the mashed sweet potatoes and foie gras in a food processor to homogeneity. Season sparingly — foie gras is rich and salty on its own. Avoid over-salting. Texture must remain soft enough to pipe but not sloppy."
- "Lay out 5 won-ton wrappers on a clean surface. Place about 8 ml (just over 1 1/2 tsp) of the filling at the center of each. Moisten edges with water to seal. Fold into triangles, pressing firmly along seams to push out air pockets. If air stays inside, raviolis will burst in hot water. Repeat with remaining dough and filling."
- "Bring a large pot of salted water to a gentle boil. Lower heat to maintain a soft simmer. Drop raviolis carefully — they should float to surface once cooked, about 3-4 minutes. Remove with slotted spoon or spider. Don't overcrowd pot; cook in batches if needed."
- "Heat clarified butter or grapeseed oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-high. When oil shimmers, add raviolis. Brown each side 2-3 minutes until a golden crust forms. Sound should sizzle gently; too much smoke means temperature is too high."
- "Deglaze pan with veal demi-glace and Muscat wine, scraping browned bits for flavor. Add raisins, stir and cook just 1-2 more minutes until grapes swell but don’t collapse. Sauce must be glossy, slightly thick, not watery."
- "Taste sauce. Adjust salt, pepper carefully as foie gras already carries seasoning. Serve 5 raviolis per person with sauce spooned over top. Garnish optional—microgreens or chives for slight herbal lift."
introduction: "Mashed sweet potatoes in place of starchy white potatoes. Adds depth, mild sweetness, better emulsification with foie gras fat. Won-ton wrappers instead of fresh pasta sheets cuts down prep time; thinner pasta cooks quickly yet holds up to filling weight. Seared in clarified butter for higher smoke point and clean surface caramelization. Veal demi-glace swapped for traditional duck fond to keep pan sauce balanced, slightly reduced Muscat used. Raisins add subtle pop and texture contrast but golden types preferred — less acidic. Balance richness with bright wine reduction. Avoid soggy dough. Press seams tight. Timing based on feel: skin should silky yet resilient. No holes, no leaking filling. Keep sauce sheen, grapes plump but intact. Perfect for showy small plates or starters. Learn your dough's snap. Adjust heat smartly—can burn butter fast."
ingredientsNote: "Sweet potato choice crucial; starchy varieties yield best mash texture — avoid watery or waxy types. Foie gras fresh or terrine form tastes similar here, but rougher cuts need finely pureeing for smooth filling. Won-ton sheets found in Asian markets or supermarket frozen aisles; thaw before use. Can use dried pasta sheets if needed but will require longer cooking. Clarified butter preferred for browning without smoking; grapeseed oil or sunflower oil is a neutral, equally high smoke point alternative. Veal demi-glace widely available in specialty shops, can substitute rich chicken stock plus mushroom powder for umami boost if needed. Muscat wine Beaumes de Venise provides fragrant sweetness; a dry muscat or even a late harvest riesling replace well. Golden raisins give juicy burst and gentle tannins, try dried apricots chopped if unavailable but soak briefly to soften. Season carefully at mixing and just before serving; foie gras already provides saltiness."
instructionsNote: "Blending filling evenly critical — lumps cause uneven cooking, risk breaking raviolis. Watch dough as you seal; water gluing edges must be just enough — too wet, dough becomes soggy, too dry, little adhesion. Pinch seams firmly with fingertips, pressing out air is key to avoid balloons. Water boils first, then reduce heat to simmer before dropping raviolis; violent boil will damage delicate skins. Floating is your doneness guide, not strict time. Drain quickly and fully — standing water ruins crisping step. Heating butter or oil just till shimmering prevents smoking and burnt taste. Brown raviolis gently, turning only once or twice for even crust. When adding wine and demi-glace, keep medium heat; aggressive boil evaporates liquids too fast, thinning sauce. Raisins added last to preserve shape; overcooked raisins collapse turning sticky. Taste salt finish carefully; too much ruins balance. Serve immediately or raviolis soften, dough loses crunch. Plate with sauce spooned on, small microgreens for contrast optional but refreshing."
tips:
- "Blending filling needs care — avoid lumps. Keep texture soft but firm. Pipe easily. Check for salt. Foie is salty. Start light."
- "Sealing raviolis is a must. Water at edges helps. Too much water = soggy dough. Press tightly. Avoid air pockets. They pop."
- "Cook pasta till float — about 3-4 minutes in simmering water. Watch closely. Overcooking breaks them. Timing is key. Drain well."
- "Skillet heat important. Clarified butter at shimmering point. Medium-high will brown. Too hot burns quickly. Adjust as needed."
- "When deglazing, keep it gentle. Add demi-glace and wine. Scrape pan bits. Don’t rush — let sauce thicken. Gloss finish sought."
faq:
- "q: How to store leftover raviolis? a: Refrigerate in airtight for a day. Can freeze too—place in single layer first. Thaw before cooking."
- "q: Why are my raviolis bursting? a: Likely air pockets or too much water. Press seams tight. Cook gently, simmer not boil."
- "q: Can I substitute ingredients? a: Yes, duck liver terrine works too. Clarified butter swap with grapeseed oil. Options available."
- "q: How to tell if sauce is ready? a: Glossy look, slightly thick. Raisins plump but round. Too watery means simmer longer. Adjust heat."
