title: "Garlic Citrus Emulsion"
slug: "garlic-citrus-emulsion"
description: "A creamy, garlicky emulsion made by whisking egg whites and citrus juice into oil and water, resembling a mayonnaise. Bright with fresh lemon-like acidity and savory garlic punch, but swapped traditional lemon for yuzu and canola oil for avocado oil to offer a subtle fruity undertone. Double the garlic for bolder flavor and swapped egg whites for aquafaba for a vegan twist. Texture thickens quickly once oil drizzled steadily. Chill to thicken further and store refrigerated up to a week."
metaDescription: "Garlic Citrus Emulsion with yuzu juice; creamy texture meets garlic punch. Quick to prepare, flavors bright, perfect for dipping or sauces."
ogDescription: "Creamy Garlic Citrus Emulsion; great with veggies, sandwiches. Use yuzu for a twist - quick and easy with just a few ingredients."

ingredients:
- "4 garlic cloves, quartered (about 20 g)"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) yuzu juice or freshly squeezed lemon juice"
- "20 ml (1 tbsp) aquafaba (reserved chickpea water) or 2 egg whites"
- "3 ml (1/2 tsp) sea salt"
- "300 ml (1 1/4 cups) avocado oil or light olive oil"
- "175 ml (3/4 cup) cold filtered water"
instructions:
- "In a tall, narrow container, combine garlic, aquafaba or egg whites, citrus juice, and salt."
- "Using an immersion blender, blitz ingredients until you see a homogenous puree with visible bubbles—look for a frothy texture, not coarse bits."
- "Keep blender running; drizzle in half the oil (around 150 ml) in a thin, steady stream. Watch as the mixture thickens quickly, turning creamy and opaque, like a loose mayo. Should take less than 90 seconds to emulsify."
- "Alternate adding water and remaining oil—pour a few tablespoons of cold water, then oil, repeating until all incorporated. This tempers texture, balancing thickness and a light mouthfeel."
- "Final texture should cling to a spoon but flow slowly, silky without excess oiliness."
- "Taste and adjust salt or citrus if needed—yuzu sharpness can vary."
- "Store in an airtight container chilled; texture tightens further cold. Use within 5-7 days."
- "If it breaks (oil separates), stop adding liquid, blend vigorously at low speed until it comes back. Cold ingredients slow emulsions; room temp helps restoration."
introduction: "Garlic emulsions, a cousin to mayonnaise, rely on rapid, controlled blending to marry oil and aqueous elements. The secret: steady, thin oil stream while an egg white or aquafaba rises and traps the oil in a network of proteins. No rush—too fast, and oil pools; too slow, and emulsion barely forms. The aroma of smashed garlic hits immediately—sharp, fresh, pungent. Switching to yuzu juice sharpens acidity while offering an exotic twist, brighter than lemon or lime alone. Avocado oil’s smooth, buttery notes balance garlic’s bite, unlike neutral canola. Aquafaba replaces egg whites here—vegan-friendly, though protein content differs, so watch texture carefully. The buzz in the bowl as blender spins, the creamy waves that follow—signals you nailed it. Too thin? More oil or less water. Too thick? Add tiny splash water, pulse. A generous sprinkle of salt wakes everything up, finishing with clarity and punch. Keep cool to maintain emulsion but let linger a moment at room temp for silkiness."
ingredientsNote: "Garlic's raw aroma is distinct, so fresh cloves are crucial—avoid sprouted or dry bulbs. Crushing garlic helps release oils before immersion. Aquafaba replaces egg whites to cater to dairy-free or vegan diets; it lacks the exact protein structure but can hold oil well with persistent blending. Yuzu juice is a superb swap for traditional lemon juice—offers floral top notes plus acidity; fresh lemon or lime can work if unavailable but expect less complex layers. Avocado oil instead of canola adds depth and richness but keep it light to avoid overpowering garlic’s clarity. Water must be cold to slow separation and aid viscosity. Adjust salt carefully; garlic can mute salt perception."
instructionsNote: "Use a tall container to minimize splatter and maximize air incorporation. Start blending garlic and aquafaba first to break down fibers and introduce air—look for persistent froth. Drizzle oil slowly, not like pouring soda; thin steady streams force protein networks to wrap oil droplets, creating stable emulsion. Signs of success: mixture thickens, changes from translucent to creamy white. If oil pools or floats, pause, blend slowly without adding liquid until recombined. Water addition tempers thickness, ensuring sauce won’t be heavy or greasy—add slowly, alternating with oil. Taste mid-process for salt and acid balance. Chill soon after blending; refrigeration thickens texture and locks flavor. If broken, persistence in blending at low speed often rescues, but don't panic—technique and pace are everything here. Keep blade submerged; aeration affects outcome."
tips:
- "Start with fresh garlic. Texture matters, avoid dried, sprouted cloves. Crush, release oils first. Garlic aroma fills space—crucial. Blend well for frothy puree."
- "Use cold water. Helps with viscosity. Prevents separation. Incorporate slowly. Add oil in thin steady streams. Don't rush—too fast, won't emulsify right."
- "Aquafaba is a great substitute for egg whites. Works for vegan needs. It has less protein, so blend longer. Watch the texture closely."
- "Want a thinner emulsion? Increase oil. Add gradually. Too thick? Tiny splash of cold water helps. Pulse. Adjust salt too—flavor balance is vital."
- "If it breaks, don't panic. Stop adding liquid, blend slowly until it comes back. Cold ingredients? They slow down emulsification. Room temp helps fix issues."
faq:
- "q: How to store my emulsion? a: Airtight container. Chill well. Lasts up to a week. Consistency tightens when cold."
- "q: What if it separates? a: Blend low speed, no liquid added. Wait. Cold ingredients? They cause breaks. Keep a steady pace."
- "q: Can I replace yuzu? a: Yes, lemon or lime can work. Just less complex taste. Fresh juice always best. Adjust for tartness."
- "q: How to use this emulsion? a: Perfect as a dip. Great with chips or veggies. Use in sandwiches. Versatile condiment."
