ingredients:
- "100 g fresh coriander leaves and stems (about 3 cups packed)"
- "3 scallions, roughly chopped"
- "2 garlic cloves, halved"
- "1 serrano pepper, seeded"
- "10 ml fresh turmeric root, chopped"
- "3 ml ground coriander"
- "70 ml grapeseed oil"
- "80 ml water"
- "25 ml lemon juice"
- "1 small red bell pepper, seeded and finely diced"
instructions:
- "1. Combine coriander, scallions, garlic, serrano, turmeric, and ground coriander in food processor. Pulse to coarse paste."
- "2. Transfer to mixing bowl. Stir in grapeseed oil, water, and lemon juice until emulsified."
- "3. Fold in the diced red bell pepper, season with salt and pepper to taste. Chill 10 minutes."
- "4. Serve alongside roasted vegetable stew, lentil curry, or grilled tofu. Offers brightness and bite."
introduction: "Herbs tossed raw, crushed alive. Citrus juice tangy, sharp. Swapping jalapeño for serrano shifts heat profile — hotter, fruitier. Turmeric roots in for warmth, deeper earth notes. Ground coriander for subtle nuttiness, less cumin. Red bell pepper for crunch and color pop, instead of tomato. Oil choice changed to grapeseed — lighter, more neutral. The texture a little chunkier, more rustic. Not just sauce, but a zesty sidekick. Chill a bit, let flavors meld. Quick pounding in food processor — less puree more rustic. Vibrant green, fresh with bursts of spice and citrus. Ideal with roasts, beans, or grilled proteins. Vegan, allergen aware."
ingredientsNote: "Coriander leaves and flexible stems, always use both for full flavor complexity. Fresh turmeric root differs from powdered; sharper, aromatic, slightly bitter. Serrano peppers have more fire — adjust to taste or swap for fresher mild chili. Grapeseed oil chosen here for its clean, light mouthfeel, but mild olive or avocado could work fine. Red bell pepper diced finely for texture, to brighten with subtle sweetness. Lemon juice adds clean, zesty tartness, easily replaced by lime if preferred. Ground coriander powder works better than cumin this time to keep spicy warmth but less pungent."
instructionsNote: "Start by rough chopping all fresh ingredients to ease food processor load. Pulse in short bursts so the mixture stays somewhat coarse — more bite. When adding liquids, do it gradually while stirring to emulsify but keep chunks intact. Season near the end to adjust salt and pepper without diluting fresh flavors. Tomato replaced by red bell pepper adds crunch so fold gently. Chill at least 10 minutes to let flavors marry. Serve cold or room temp. Great to toss into grain bowls, dollop on curry or pair with grilled plates. Can be refreshed with a splash more lemon or a pinch of smoked paprika for a smoky twist."
tips:
- "Chop coriander and scallions first. Helps food processor. Makes easier to blend. Pulse isn't about smoothness. It's coarse paste."
- "Adjust pepper heat. Serrano packs punch. Remove seeds, keep some heat. Swap for milder chili if needed. More options."
- "Keep texture rustic. Don’t overprocess. Marble the mixture, leave some bits intact. It’s for crunchiness. Brightness in every bite."
- "Let chill in fridge. At least 10 minutes. Marrying flavors is crucial. It enhances taste. Citrus, spices blend better when cold."
- "Taste as you go. Always season near end. Added salt and pepper. Balance is key. Adjust until it feels just right."
faq:
- "q: How long does the sauce last? a: Store in airtight container. 4-5 days max for freshness. Check for off smells before using. Keep chilled."
- "q: Can I use dried herbs? a: Fresh herbs are best. Dried lacks depth. If necessary, use sparingly. Less potent flavor. Adjust amounts."
- "q: What to serve it with? a: Great with grilled proteins. Use as dip for veggies. Perfect on beans too. Versatile sauce, complements many."
- "q: Can I freeze the sauce? a: Freezing is possible. But freshness quality drops. Use ice cube trays for portions. Thaw in fridge as needed."
