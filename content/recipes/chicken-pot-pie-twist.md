ingredients:
- "=== Shortcrust Pastry ==="
- "360 ml (1 1/2 cups) unbleached all-purpose flour"
- "1 ml (1/4 tsp) salt"
- "140 ml (9 tbsp) cold unsalted butter, diced"
- "70 ml (5 c. tbsp) ice water, approx"
- "Cheddar cheese, grated, to brush crust"
- "=== Filling ==="
- "380 ml (1 1/2 cups) chicken stock"
- "1 boneless skinless chicken breast (200 g)"
- "1 medium sweet potato, peeled diced"
- "1 medium parsnip, peeled diced"
- "1 small onion, finely chopped"
- "2 cloves roasted garlic, mashed"
- "40 ml (2 2/3 tbsp) unsalted butter"
- "50 ml (3 1/2 tbsp) brown rice flour"
- "100 ml (about 1/2 cup) fresh or frozen peas, thawed"
- "1 tsp fresh thyme leaves"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "=== Pastry ==="
- "Pulse flour and salt in food processor briefly. Add cold butter cubes. Pulse 3 seconds bursts, watch for butter pebble-sized like small peas but not melted. Critical - stops dough from getting tough. Pour in ice water gradually, pulse until dough holds but isn't sticky. Too much water - pastry weeps. If too dry, add tiny sips of water only. Dump out, pat into two flattened discs. Wrap, chill minimum 35 minutes. Chill locks butter chunks, essential for flakiness."
- "=== Filling ==="
- "Heat stock to simmer. Poach chicken breast gently 12-17 minutes until opaque through but not rubbery. Timing varies with thickness. Test with finger press; should yield slightly, juices clear. Remove, cool, dice medium-sized cubes."
- "Add sweet potato and parsnip to simmering stock. Cook until fork tender, around 12 min. Drain veggies, reserve exactly 380 ml (1 1/2 cups) liquid. Add water if lost volume; broth consistency key for gravy texture."
- "Melt butter in large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and roasted garlic mash. Stir and sweat until translucent, soft, fragrant - about 5 minutes. Avoid browning edges. Sprinkle brown rice flour evenly, cook 2 minutes to remove raw taste, stirring often."
- "Gradually whisk in reserved stock. Bring to gentle boil stirring constantly until thickened. Should lightly coat spoon back, no lumps - if too runny, simmer extra 2-3 minutes."
- "Add diced chicken, cooked vegetables, thyme leaves. Season heavily with salt and pepper. Taste check - filling needs punch as pastry dulls flavor. Set aside to cool to lukewarm; hot filling shrinks dough and messes crust seal."
- "=== Assembly ==="
- "Flour surface lightly. Roll one dough disc to fit 23 cm (9 in) pie pan, about 3 mm thick. Press gently—no overhandling to keep layers crisp. Trim edges flush with pan rim."
- "Pour filling evenly into base. Roll second disc and cut vents — multiple small slits or pattern of choice."
- "Place top crust over filling, seal edges by pinching with fingers or fork. Brush entire crust surface generously with grated cheddar cheese for golden color and savory crust notes."
- "Set oven rack low-middle. Preheat oven to 205°C (400°F)."
- "Bake 33-38 minutes. Watch crust color — deep golden with bubbling juices at slits mean ready. Bottom crust can be checked via lifting edge carefully; should feel crisp, not doughy. Let sit 10 minutes after baking to set filling further."
- "Slice with sharp serrated knife to avoid crushing crust."
introduction: "Flaky crust. Chicken simmered just right, tender flakes. Parsnip adds earthiness where carrot would usually sit; sweet potatoes bring smooth natural sweetness, balance savory. Roasted garlic folded into onions mellows sharpness, lifts aroma. Brown rice flour thickens without chalky aftertaste. Grated cheddar wash crisps crust, adds color that milk glaze can’t match. Timing? Watch not clock. The sizzle of bubbling filling, golden sheen on crust, tell you when it’s time. Pie rests a moment out of oven; filling firms up, easier to slice clean. Classic comfort but with subtle twists you won’t see coming. Trust these cues; seasoning matter, no bland mush here. Handle dough gently; temperature is crust’s best friend. Kitchen smells turn homespun."
ingredientsNote: "Butter cold, important – warm butter ruins texture every time. Brown rice flour replaces all-purpose to avoid too-thick, pasty texture in filling. Parsnip is a low-cost alternative to carrot, adds deeper flavor. Sweet potato swaps regular potato for texture and vitamin boost; cook times slightly longer, check tenderness. Roasted garlic can be done days ahead, mellow sweetness stores well, shortcut for flavor punch. If cheddar not handy, sharp aged gouda or pecorino also work. Ice water critical in pastry - use only small amounts. No rush here: re-chill dough if it softens. Remember, pie crust always benefits from rest in fridge pre and post rolling."
instructionsNote: "Butter chunk size dictates crust flakiness. Over-pulsing melts butter – dough loses lift. Using brown rice flour avoids gritty aftertaste sometimes given by plain white flour. Poach chicken gently; juicy filling requires soft meat in cubes, not shredded or overcooked. Veggies cooked separately from filling thickening step keeps texture distinct, prevents mush. Deglazing pan with broth after onions elevates flavor. Prepare filling cool; filling too hot steams crust from inside, causing sogginess or cracks. Skim bubbles from simmering gravy then fold in meat and veggies. Vent cuts important for steam escape; no vents equals soaked crust top. Cheese wash browns crust evenly; milk or cream can produce blotchy color variations. Midway rotate pie for even browning if your oven hot spots. Let pie rest after oven; filling firms, flavors marry. Stick to sensory signs not timers for best result."
tips:
- "Butter temp matters. Cold butter = flaky crust. Keep it that way. Grades of flour fluctuate. Use quality to hold structure. Handle dough quickly - don't overwork it."
- "Garlic roasted? Make ahead. Store well, mellow flavor. Gives depth. Adjust thickness with brown rice flour; avoid graininess. Whisk well for gravy - no lumps."
- "Sauté onions low heat. Avoid color; want soft and sweet. Drain veggies; don’t leave too much liquid. Blends flavors without making it a soup."
- "Watch color in oven. Rotate halfway for even browning. Let pie rest after baking to set filling. Slicing too soon means messy. Hold flavors."
- "Sweet potato swaps are key. Boosts vitamins versus regular potato. Roasting garlic?  Enjoy time savings. Play with cheese options; gouda or pecorino found in most fridges."
faq:
- "q: How to fix a soggy pie crust? a: Use chilled butter. Avoid letting filling steam crust by cooling it. Ensure good venting."
- "q: What's best way to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. Reheat gently in oven for crispness. Avoid microwave - it sogs crust."
- "q: Can I use other vegetables? a: Yes, carrots or celery work fine. Adjust cook times as needed. Keep texture in mind; don’t mush."
- "q: Why did my filling spill over? a: Too much liquid left. Drain properly. Also may need more venting if packed tight."
