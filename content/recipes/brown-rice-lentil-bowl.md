- "120g (2/3 cup) red lentils rinsed and drained"
- "720ml (3 cups) vegetable broth"
- "45ml (3 tbsp) olive oil"
- "2 cloves garlic minced"
- "1 star anise"
- "2 thin slices fresh ginger about 2 cm long"
- "3 medium shallots thinly sliced"
- "390 ml (14 oz) canned red lentils rinsed and drained"
- "125ml (1/2 cup) unsweetened coconut yogurt"
- "5ml (1 tsp) smoked paprika"
- "15g (3 tbsp) toasted pepitas"
- "10g (1/4 cup) chopped fresh mint"
- "Lemon wedges to serve"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Heat olive oil in large saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic, ginger slices, and star anise. Stir for 1-2 minutes until fragrant."
- "Add rinsed rice and red lentils. Toss well to coat with oil and aromatics. Pour in vegetable broth. Season with salt and pepper."
- "Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 25 minutes or until rice and lentils are tender and liquid absorbed. Remove star anise and ginger slices. Keep covered and let rest 8 minutes."
- "While rice cooks, heat remaining olive oil in skillet over medium-high. Add shallots. Cook stirring frequently, about 12 minutes until deeply caramelized and golden brown."
- "Once rice mixture rests, fold in canned red lentils gently. Taste and adjust seasoning."
- "Transfer rice and lentil mix to serving dish. Spoon caramelized shallots over top."
- "Mix coconut yogurt with smoked paprika. Drizzle over or dollop on side."
- "Garnish with toasted pepitas and chopped mint."
- "Serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over."
introduction: "Brown basmati and red lentils join in a hearty grain and legume combo. Cooked slow with ginger and star anise, warm earthy notes build deep. Shallots caramelize in olive oil until sweet and golden, adding texture and richness. Coconut yogurt with paprika cuts the richness with tang and spice. Pepitas bring crunch, fresh mint lifts the aromas, lemon slices brighten and add acidic punch. Nut free, gluten free, vegan adaptable. A main that fills and comforts but stays light with fresh elements. Simple but layered tastes and textures. Prep under 30 minutes. Cook just past 30. Serve 4 to 6. Great cold or warm."
ingredientsNote: "Brown basmati rice swaps easily with another long grain brown rice or even farro for extra chew. Red lentils blend smoothly and cook quickly but green could work, adjust cooking time. Star anise and fresh ginger introduce floral and spicy notes; if unavailable, substitute a cinnamon stick and a dash of ground ginger. Shallots take time to caramelize but patience pays off for sweetness and deep flavor. Coconut yogurt adds creaminess and tang with plant-based fats; Greek yogurt could be substituted for a creamier touch, though not vegan. Pepitas give texture and nutty crunch; pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds work well too. Fresh mint brightens after cooking, choose cilantro if preferred. Lemon wedges essential for serving, squeeze fresh just before eating to uplift flavors."
instructionsNote: "Begin by gently infusing oil with aromatics like garlic, ginger, and star anise to build a base flavor. Toast rice and lentils briefly to coat in seasoned oil before adding broth. Simmer covered on low heat until liquid is absorbed and grains softened but intact, not mushy. Remove flavoring extras like star anise and ginger slices before resting so no overpowering notes linger. While grains cook, slowly caramelize shallots in a separate pan with frequent stirring and patience for even browning without burning. Combining canned lentils after cooking preserves their texture and protein punch. Garnish last with warm caramelized shallots, then creamy paprika-spiced yogurt. Seeds and fresh herbs sprinkled last for crunch and freshness. Use this layering of textures and temperatures to elevate a simple grain bowl into something nuanced and approachable."
tips:
- "Use aromatic ingredients right. Fresh garlic and ginger are key. They build base flavor. The star anise adds depth, but don't drown the dish. Balance is important. Adjust spice levels to preference."
- "Canned lentils bring convenience, protein. Rinse them, drain well. Keep textures in mind. Overcooking can lead to mush. Add them gently to the cooked mixture. Fold in carefully, maintain structure."
- "Caramelizing shallots takes time. Low heat is best, frequent stirring prevents burning. Watch for golden color. Sweetness enhances the dish's richness. Itâ€™s a contrast to spiced yogurt, which adds tang."
- "Serving ideas can vary. Spice up the yogurt with extra seasonings, like curry or garlic. Experiment. Mint is fresh, but cilantro also works. Lemon wedges are essential. Squeeze before eating."
- "Storing the leftovers can be tricky. Keep in an airtight container in the fridge. Reheat gently. Microwave or stovetop works. Add a splash of broth if dry. Enjoy warm or cold."
faq:
- "q: How long can I store this dish? a: Store in the fridge for up to four days. Airtight container is a must. Can freeze too, but will change texture. Best fresh."
- "q: What if I don't have star anise? a: Cinnamon is good, or ground ginger can work. Different flavor profiles though. Adjust according to taste, it changes the dish."
- "q: Can I make this dish in advance? a: Yes, the flavors develop. Make a day ahead and refrigerate. Reheat evenly before serving. Fresh herbs added last."
- "q: What can I substitute for coconut yogurt? a: Plain yogurt is fine but not vegan. Cashew cream is another option, adds creaminess. Tailor to dietary needs. Adjust flavor balance."
