- "=== Gremolata ==="
- "25 ml 1 1/2 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsley"
- "1 small shallot finely minced"
- "5 ml 1 tsp orange zest"
- "5 ml 1 tsp lime zest"
- "5 ml 1 tsp lemon zest"
- "1 medium tomato seeded and diced"
- "10 ml 2 tsp lemon juice"
- "30 ml 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil"
- "45 ml 3 tbsp crumbled feta cheese"
- "10 ml 2 tsp finely chopped fresh chives"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "=== PREPARE PASTA ==="
- "Boil a large pot of salted water. Drop fusilli, cook until al dente about 12-13 minutes or a bit firmer. Drain pasta thoroughly."
- "Rinse quickly under cold water to stop cooking, drain well. Drizzle a touch of olive oil, toss lightly to keep separate. Set aside to cool."
- "=== MIX GREMOLATA ==="
- "In a bowl, combine parsley, minced shallot, citrus zests (orange, lime, lemon)."
- "Add diced tomato, lemon juice, olive oil, crumbled feta, and chopped chives."
- "Season generously with salt and freshly cracked black pepper."
- "=== ASSEMBLE SALAD ==="
- "Once the pasta is cooled, add the gremolata mixture directly in the bowl."
- "Toss everything carefully until all coated."
- "Adjust seasoning if needed."
- "Serve immediately or chill briefly for flavors to mingle."
introduction: "Something quick to pack taste without fuss. Pasta salad works. Cold, tangy, bursts from citrus zest. Fresh herbs hold the key. Skip garlic, use shallot instead - softer, sweeter sharpness. Instead of parmesan, crumbled feta changes texture and salt profile. Fusilli curls catch gremolata better than flat shapes. Throw in diced tomato for freshness and color. Salt and pepper bring it all to balance. Mix and chill or eat right away. Bright, clean, easy. Six people served but feel free to scale. Done under half an hour, prep and cook combined, with some extra chill time if you want. No nuts. No lactose free here, but omit or swap feta if needed. Good for summer lunch or light supper. Citrus tang, herb scent fills kitchen."
ingredientsNote: "Fusilli replaces original pasta to give tighter curls for gremolata to cling better. Parsley remains flat-leaf, chopped finely for greener notes. Garlic swapped for a mild shallot minced very small for soft onion flavor without harshness. Three zests stay: orange, lime, lemon but emphasize smaller amounts so no overpowering bites. Tomato diced small, seeds removed to avoid wetness that can drown pasta. Juice fresh lemon for acidity, combined with olive oil to emulsify gremolata bits. Parmesan out, feta crumbled in: saltier, creamier chunks contrast fresh herbs. Chives tossed in finely, adding onion nuances but light. Salt and pepper essential to adjust the brightness and savory tone just before serving. Olive oil is good quality; drizzle cautiously to not over-oil the salad or make it greasy. Whole gremolata mix is loosely saucy but more like a chunky herb paste. Everything fresh. No nut inclusion keeps allergy safe. Not lactose free without swapping feta for vegan alternative or omitting cheese altogether."
instructionsNote: "Boiling pasta al dente takes around 12-13 minutes. Important to time well and salt water generously for flavor depth. Rinsing pasta with cold water stops cooking and cools it rapidly, prevents clumping. Toss in a teaspoon of olive oil just enough to separate strands but not oily feel. Gremolata layered stepwise: herbs, zests, shallot first to build flavor foundation. Then add tomato and lemon juice, olive oil to create dressing consistency. Feta crumbled last preserves texture. Chives stir in gently to not bruise. Salt and pepper come at end: seasoning can change after resting. Mixing salad is delicate: fold not mash to keep tomato pieces. Serve immediately for fresher taste or 5-10 minutes chill to let flavors blend without sogginess. Easy to scale for more servings. Keeps well but best fresh within a few hours. Can be packed ahead for picnic style meals but hold off dressing and toss before serving if possible."
tips:
- "Choosing pasta size and shape is key. Fusilli is fun. Twists catch the gremolata better. Al dente cooking is crucial. 12-13 minutes. Salt enough to flavor."
- "Shallots offer a milder taste than garlic. Mince very finely. Use small amounts of zests. Orange, lemon, lime. Just enough to brighten. Not overpower."
- "Tomato should be diced small. Remove seeds for less moisture. Cold rinse pasta. Stops cooking quickly. Keep texture firm. Drizzle with olive oil to avoid sticking."
- "Olive oil quality matters. Just a touch. Not too greasy. Ratios in gremolata need balance. Feta crumbled, not shredded. Preserves chunks for texture."
- "Mix salad gently. Fold ingredients, donâ€™t mash. Tomato pieces stay intact. Season just before serving. Salt and pepper can enhance flavors after resting."
faq:
- "q: What can I use instead of fusilli? a: Try penne or rotini. Similar shape. Both hold sauce well. Pasta choice impacts texture."
- "q: Is this salad good for meal prep? a: Yes, but dress last minute. Keeps fresh longer. Flavors develop when mixed just before eating."
- "q: Can I use a different cheese? a: Absolutely. Goat cheese works well. Creamy. Or omit cheese entirely for a dairy-free option."
- "q: How long can I store this salad? a: Best eaten fresh within few hours. If needed, a day in fridge works. Check for texture and freshness before serving."
