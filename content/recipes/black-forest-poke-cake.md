slug: "black-forest-poke-cake"
description: "Dark chocolate cake base with rich cherry filling soaked in fudge sauce plus a light whipped cream layer topped with fresh fruit and chocolate chips. Uses sour cream instead of buttermilk for moisture and almond extract swaps vanilla for a nutty depth. Slightly longer bake time to firm edges with visual cues over exact minutes. Fudge topping replaced by homemade ganache for thicker, less sweet consistency. Cherry filling doubled for juicier pockets yet balanced with fresh berries on top. Poking method explained to avoid cake collapse. Chill times emphasized for clean slices and flavor melding."

ingredients:
- "15 ounces dark chocolate cake mix"
- "4 large eggs"
- "1/2 cup vegetable oil"
- "1 cup sour cream"
- "1 teaspoon almond extract"
- "12 ounces cherry pie filling"
- "8 ounces whipped cream topping"
- "1/4 cup mini chocolate chips"
- "6 ounces bittersweet chocolate chips"
- "1/2 cup heavy cream"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 355°F. Grease a 9x13 pan generously with vegetable shortening or butter for even crust formation. Set aside."
- "In large bowl, mix cake mix, eggs, oil, sour cream, and almond extract with paddle attachment or hand mixer on medium speed. Batter will be thick yet spreadable. Avoid overmixing to keep crumb tender."
- "Scrape batter into pan. Use offset spatula to level top and tap pan firmly on counter to release air bubbles. Look for batter settling evenly."
- "Bake 28–30 minutes or until edges pull slightly from pan and center springs back lightly when pressed. Toothpick should come out with just a few moist crumbs, no wet batter."
- "Pull from oven. Cool 10 minutes before poking to avoid too fragile top layer breaking apart."
- "Using wooden skewer or end of wooden spoon, poke holes evenly all over cake about 2 inches apart. Holes should go deep but not break bottom crust. This maximizes seepage of fudge."
- "For ganache, heat heavy cream in microwave until just simmering (bubbles appear at edge, not boiling), pour over bittersweet chips, let sit 2 minutes. Stir until glossy, thick, and pourable but not runny."
- "Pour ganache over warm cake, spreading gently with spatula or back of spoon, pushing slightly to fill holes. Resist overworking surface or ganache may pool unevenly."
- "Cover pan with foil tightly, refrigerate 2 hours minimum to let ganache set and flavors meld. Cake will firm and ganache sinks into holes for moist pockets."
- "Once chilled, spread whipped topping evenly to edges with offset spatula. Be gentle to avoid breaking cake surface."
- "Spoon cherry pie filling evenly over whipped layer. Use syrup sparingly to avoid soggy topping. Scatter mini chocolate chips and add fresh halved cherries or raspberries if available for contrast and freshness."
- "Refrigerate covered at least 1 hour before slicing with a serrated knife. Clean knife between cuts for neat squares. Keep chilled until serving."
- "If lacking sour cream, plain Greek yogurt works but expect slightly denser crumb. No almond extract? Use extra vanilla but reduces nutty aroma. If ganache seems too thick on cooling, microwave 10 seconds and stir to loosen."
- "Use wooden tools for poking. Metal skewers risk shredding crumb. Tap pan after pouring batter to reduce air pockets but not vigorously or batter may splash."
- "Chilling for flavor sync important here. Ganache penetrates holes and creamed layer stays stable, preventing whipped topping meltdown."
introduction: "Deep, dark chocolate, but not sickly sweet. The crumb holds moisture without sogging—good structure thanks to sour cream swapping in for buttermilk; keeps it tender but stable. Cherry pie filling layering with whipped cream—and that quick ganache—not your standard fudge topping but thicker and less sugary. Poke holes method critical, helps sauce seep but keeps cake intact. Watch the baking cues—edges pulling away, slight spring back under finger means done; toothpick stays mostly clean with moist crumbs. Chill time isn't optional; sets the ganache in pockets, firms whipped layer. Skip the vanilla, hit almond extract for a subtle nutty note balancing richness. Chocolate chips scattered on top aren’t just decoration—add texture contrast. This thing holds shape, slices clean, and tastes fully layered. No soggy mess here."
ingredientsNote: "Dark chocolate cake mix as base but swapping sour cream for buttermilk—sour cream adds fat and tang, helps keep crumb tender yet sturdy. Almond extract instead of vanilla—adds deeper, nutty undertone that pairs well with cherry and chocolate. Cherry pie filling doubled but poured gently over whipped cream to keep topping from sinking or making it mushy. Ganache replaces fudge topping—two ingredients, easy and yields richer finish without cloying sweetness or runny puddles. Mini chocolate chips on top not mandatory but add bite contrast and melt slowly in mouth. If you can't find whipped topping, chilled heavy cream whipped stiff works, but spread right before serving for best volume retention."
instructionsNote: "Start by preheating properly and greasing pan well to avoid sticking—shortening preferred over spray for even crust. Mixing—don't overbeat or cake turns tough; thick and a bit lumpy batter is normal for devil’s food. Baking times vary—watch for edges and spring-back touch test rather than timer fixation. Poking—use wooden tools, steady hand, holes close enough to soak but spaced to avoid cake collapse. Ganache swirling over warm cake gives seepage in holes but don’t over-mix or ganache pools unevenly. Cooling times matter: warm cake and ganache combo needs fridge to set—buffer between warm and cold prevents whipped topping meltdown. Spread whipped cream gently; torn cake makes presentation messy. Topping with fruit and chips last step—keeps fresh texture intact. Clean serrated knife for slices, wipe blade between cuts to avoid ragged edges. Good knives and patience make all the difference."
tips:
- "Preheat, very important. Cream shortening in pan. Use butter. Uniform crust. Work gentle. No rush."
- "Watch the batter, thick but mix carefully. No overbeating. It will be slightly lumpy. Perfect for moist crumb."
- "Poking holes crucial, use wooden sticks. Even spacing 2 inches apart. Don’t break crust but deep enough."
- "Chill time significant. Refrigerate well. Ganache needs that time to seep, meld flavors. Texture changes."
- "Fruit layering at the end. Add fresh cherries or berries last. Keeps them vibrant. Presentation counts."
faq:
- "q: Can I use different fruits? a: Yes, options like blueberries or strawberries work. Adjust syrup amount though. Fruit must balance sweetness."
- "q: Will cake hold if I skip chilling? a: Not recommended. Whipped topping may sag. Stability compromised without cooling."
- "q: What if ganache is too thick? a: Just microwave for short burst. Stir until manageable. Easier to spread."
- "q: Storage method? a: Keep chilled, airtight. Lasts few days but freshness fades. For longer, freeze before adding toppings."
