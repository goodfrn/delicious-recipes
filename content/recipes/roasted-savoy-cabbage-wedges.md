ingredients:
- "1 medium savoy cabbage head"
- "3 tablespoons rendered duck fat (substitute grapeseed oil or vegetable oil)"
- "1 teaspoon smoked paprika (substitute regular paprika or cumin)"
- "Salt to taste"
- "Freshly ground black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 485°F. Line two large rimmed baking trays with parchment paper or foil for easy cleanup."
- "Trim cathedral-style cabbage by slicing off root end flush with base. Cut cabbage into 10 thick wedges leaving core intact—core stops wedges falling apart while roasting."
- "Warm duck fat until fluid if solid. If unavailable, grapeseed oil or neutral vegetable oil works but renders milder flavor."
- "Drizzle fat evenly over wedges laid cut side up and down on trays. Sprinkle smoked paprika evenly over wedges, then salt and pepper generously on both sides."
- "Space wedges evenly, not crowded to promote crisp edges. Roast on middle rack for roughly 35 to 40 minutes. Flip wedges halfway at 20 minutes for even caramelization."
- "Look for deep golden brown edges, almost mahogany, bubbling fat at surfaces. Stab with fork to test tenderness—should pierce with slight resistance but no crunch."
- "Remove and let rest briefly on racks to finish crisping. Serve warm with optional squeeze of lemon or drizzle of sharp vinegar for brightness."
introduction: "High heat. Sizzle. The sharp sound of cabbage edges crisping, fat bubbling and caramelizing. Savoy's texture holds up under intense roasting, unlike soggy green heads that wilt too fast. Core intact keeps wedges stable. No limp mush here. Duck fat renders flavor into every fiber—not mandatory but worth the smoky depth. Grapeseed oil steps in if needed, neutral but with a higher smoke point for reliable browning. Smoked paprika sneaks in some earthy warmth, a quiet twist that takes ordinary cabbage beyond plain. Roasting is forgiving but demands attention to color and texture cues. Don't just watch the clock—watch those edges, smell the toasty aromas, poke to know when tender yet firm. This isn't delicate veg. It's robust, rustic and unapologetically straightforward."
ingredientsNote: "Savoy cabbage preferred for its crinkled leaves and sturdier texture but green cabbage works if Savoy unavailable. The key is thick wedges with core intact—keeps structure during roasting. Rendered duck fat adds depth and a faint gamey richness, but any neutral oil with a high smoke point like grapeseed, avocado, or refined sunflower oil will work. Olive oil can burn at these temps—use light versions or lower temp an option. Smoked paprika is optional but elevates flavor beyond simple salt and pepper, adding complexity. Season salt moderately—cabbage absorbs fat and salt well, but too much overwhelms. Black pepper freshly cracked always better. Can add a squeeze of citrus or drizzle of vinegar post-roast to cut richness and bring brightness. Avoid soaking cabbage beforehand; it will steam instead of roast crisp edges."
instructionsNote: "Start with a blazing hot oven—crucial for immediate sear on cabbage surfaces. Slice wedges carefully, core keeping wedges together preventing collapse during cooking. Fat aids browning and mouthfeel—if duck fat solid, warm gently until pourable but not hot. Even coating critical for consistent roasting. Smoking paprika adds a secondary layer of flavor but adding it too early risks burning; dust just before roasting. Space wedges apart on trays; overcrowding traps steam, yielding soggy edges. Flip halfway for even caramelization, listen for that satisfying crackle of fat meeting hot metal. Visual indicators key: avoid pale or soggy slices. When edges darken to amber or mahogany brown with bubbling fat glazed surfaces, tenderness tested by fork—need resistance, not crunch. Over-roasting scorches bitterness; under-roasting is limp and flavorless. Remove from oven, let rest briefly for texture to set. Serve these rustic wedges alongside heavier dishes or alone with acidic counters for balance. Watch for common mistake: trimming core too aggressively, wedges fall apart. Also avoid oiling after cutting; oil traps moisture causing steam. Pre-roast oiling seals in flavor and aids crust."
tips:
- "High heat is key for those crispy, caramelized edges. Preheat oven to 485°F. Don't skip this crucial step. Watch for deep browning—Amber is flavor."
- "Use techniques carefully. Cut cabbage into thick wedges, core kept intact. Core provides structure during roasting. Avoid flimsy, mushy pieces."
- "Duck fat is rich, adds depth, but if unavailable, grapeseed oil works. Focus on oils with high smoke points. Avoid oils that burn easily."
- "Smoked paprika is optional yet beneficial. Adds warmth and complexity. Sprinkle just before roasting to avoid burning. Watch closely."
- "Space wedges on the tray; overcrowding is a no-go. Leads to steaming rather than roasting. Crisp edges matter—watch for that visual cue."
faq:
- "q: How to tell if cabbage is done? a: Look for golden brown edges. Poke with a fork—should be tender but have slight resistance. No mush."
- "q: Why use duck fat instead of oil? a: Duck fat enhances flavor. Rich, gamey note. Oil works in a pinch. Choose neutral, high smoke for best results."
- "q: What if my cabbage burns? a: Reduce oven temp. Double check placement in oven—could be too close to the heating element. Try flipping cabbage sooner."
- "q: Can I store leftovers? a: Yes, cool completely, store in airtight container. Refrigerate for up to four days. Reheat in oven for crispy texture."
