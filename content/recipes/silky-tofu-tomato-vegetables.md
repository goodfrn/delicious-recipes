ingredients:
- "3 cloves garlic, finely chopped"
- "80 ml olive oil (about 1/3 cup)"
- "1 small yellow onion, thinly sliced"
- "1 red bell pepper, deseeded, cut into half strips"
- "1 can 700 ml crushed Italian tomatoes, roughly hand-crushed"
- "1 can 500 ml cannellini beans, rinsed, drained"
- "200 g trimmed French green beans, halved"
- "25 g pitted green olives, halved"
- "2 teaspoons ground coriander"
- "1 teaspoon crushed chili flakes"
- "2 blocks soft silken tofu 300 g each, cut into six cubes"
- "25 ml finely chopped fresh dill"
- "100 ml crème fraîche"
- "Lemon wedges optional"
instructions:
- "Heat large skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add garlic to oil. Hear immediately freestyling in pan, a steady sizzle means right temp. Stir. Garlic should barely color — about 1 minute."
- "Toss in sliced onion and red pepper strips. Stir, coat with oil. They should soften but keep body, about 5 minutes. Onions translucent edges crackle sometimes—ready to move on."
- "Pour crushed tomatoes, then beans, green beans, and olives. Sprinkle coriander and chili flakes evenly. Give a rough stir: aim for mingling but not breaking delicate bits."
- "Lower heat to medium-low. Partially cover skillet letting steam escape slowly—bubbling softly, tomato liquid thickens, smells intensify. Cook for 25 to 35 minutes. Stir occasionally; vegetables soften fully but keep shape. Avoid over-stirring or mashing."
- "Season with salt and fresh cracked black pepper to taste. Remove from heat. Let rest 10 minutes uncovered to settle flavors and thicken sauce further."
- "Place vegetable mixture on plates. Center cubes of tofu on top. Sprinkle with freshly chopped dill. Add dollop of crème fraîche on each serving. Offer lemon wedges for acidity; brightens girth of rich sauce when squeezed."
- "Serve warm but not steaming hot. Temperature contrast between cool tofu and warm vegetables refreshes palate."
introduction: "Soft tofu with deeply cooked vegetables in bright tomato sauce. Garlic and onions sweat slowly releasing sweetness. Fresh green beans hold bite after long gentle simmer. Kalamata olives and chili flakes give a savory shimmer with unexpected heat. Creamy dollops from crème fraîche add cool contrast. The trick? Treat these ingredients gently but take your time. Tofu doesn’t need frying; it shines soft. Look for gentle bubbling not furious boil; building flavor takes patience. A dish flexible enough for various bean choices and olive types. If silken tofu unavailable, soft fresh farmer’s cheese substitutes well but changes texture slightly. No rushing this hearty dish; the payoff lies in slow melding of tastes."
ingredientsNote: "Adjust bean variety based on pantry: chickpeas turn creamy under heat, while cannellini beans soften more dramatically, releasing starch which thickens sauce naturally. If green beans not seasonal, substitute with trimmed asparagus cut into similar lengths or blanched thin green beans to maintain snap. Swap yellow onion with sweet Vidalia for more mellow flavor. Use green olives for a brighter brine note instead of Kalamata—each shifts complexity. For a dairy-free version, replace crème fraîche with coconut yogurt or omit topping entirely. Silken tofu best for texture, firmer tofu won't melt as harmoniously and may dry during plating."
instructionsNote: "Heat control is key. Garlic’s hit in hot oil wakes flavors but burns fast—spotting tiny gold flecks on edges is your cue to add onions promptly. Softening onions until barely translucent mellows sharpness; overcooking yields bitterness. Tomatoes need gentle simmer to release sugars and reduce acidity—bubbling suggests evaporation, stirring just enough prevents burning and breaking beans apart avoids mushiness. Resting off heat thickens sauce and develops aroma. Arrange tofu cubes carefully; handle gently to avoid breaking blocks. Finish plating immediately after resting to preserve freshness of dill and cream. If sauce looks too runny, tip skillet uncovered for extra reduction, watching closely to prevent scorching. Patience here avoids dull, flat flavor."
tips:
- "Start with fresh garlic; sizzle means flavor awakens. Overcook quickly, burns fast. Look for golden edges. Onions should soften softly — translucent but firm."
- "Season gradually; add salt at different stages. Helps balance flavors. Beans can thicken sauce, stir gently; no mush. Rest off heat builds layers. Flavor develops."
- "Crushed tomatoes benefit from gentle simmer. Strong heat could burn, watch closely. Bubbling, smells should deepen. For more acidity, squeeze lemon before serving."
- "Substituting can change texture. Use chickpeas for creamy deal; cannellini softens more, releases starch. Asparagus works too, but trim right length."
- "Handle tofu carefully, fragile. Fresh dill enhances aroma; sprinkle last minute. If crème fraîche not available, coconut yogurt is fitting alternative or skip completely."
faq:
- "q: How to get the right texture for the beans? a: Start with rinsing well. Too much liquid ruins thickness. Gentle heat controls mushiness. Stir minimally."
- "q: What can I do if the sauce is too runny? a: Consider tipping the skillet uncovered. Steam escapes, reduces sauce. Just watching closely to avoid burning; adjust heat."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Store in airtight container. Refrigerate for up to three days. Can also freeze, but watch for texture changes; thaw slowly."
- "q: What if I don't have silken tofu? a: Substitute with soft fresh farmer’s cheese; different texture but works. Or just omit for lighter dish."
