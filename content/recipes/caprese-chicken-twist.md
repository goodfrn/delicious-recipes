description: "Marinate trimmed chicken breasts in zesty Italian dressing and kosher salt, 2-20 hours. Grill or oven roast, cooking to firm 165°F internal temp, backing by sight and touch. Substitute fresh mozzarella with burrata for creaminess or use heirloom tomatoes instead of roasted for brighter pop. Melt cheese on top before serving, finish with basil, drizzle aged balsamic glaze. Add shredded pecorino or smoked salt in place of parmesan or Maldon. Timing’s a guide; trust sizzle, juices to judge doneness. Always oil grill grates to prevent sticking; discard marinade after chicken’s out to avoid contamination. Enjoy texture contrasts – melted cheese, tender chicken, vibrant basil and sharp, sweet balsamic tang."

ingredients:
- "6 boneless skinless chicken breasts trimmed of excess fat"
- "1 cup zesty Italian dressing or use a mix of olive oil, vinegar, garlic, oregano"
- "1 tsp kosher salt"
- "12 roasted tomato slices or substitute with fresh heirloom tomatoes"
- "12 slices fresh or burrata mozzarella cheese"
- "Fresh basil leaves for topping"
- "1/3 cup aged balsamic glaze or reduction"
- "Optional: shredded pecorino cheese or grated smoked gouda"
- "Optional: flaky sea salt such as Maldon or smoked salt"
- "Freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "=== Marinate ==="
- "Trim chicken breasts removing visible fat and tendons. Place in airtight bag with Italian dressing and kosher salt; toss lightly to coat. Chill between 2 and 20 hours — longer marinate deepens flavor but beware mushiness from acid if over 20 hours."
- "=== Grill Method ==="
- "Preheat grill to medium-high ~375°F. Oil grates liberally — prevents sticking, helps sear. Pull chicken from marinade, shake off excess liquid, toss marinade to waste. Place chicken over indirect heat, not directly on coals to avoid flare-ups."
- "Grill 6-12 minutes per side depending on thickness. Watch for juices running clear and firm but springy feel. Use instant-read thermometer aiming for 165°F internal temp; stop checking at 160°F to avoid drying. Remove heat but keep on grill."
- "Top each breast with 2-3 tomato slices and mozzarella or burrata. Close grill lid, allow cheese to soften and slightly melt, about 3-5 minutes. Avoid overmelting; want soft pillows, not liquid."
- "Lift chicken carefully, plate it, scatter fresh basil leaves on top. Drizzle with balsamic glaze. Optionally sprinkle flaky salt and cracked pepper or pecorino shavings."
- "=== Oven Method ==="
- "Preheat oven to 405°F. Lightly spray baking dish or sheet with oil. Shake excess marinade off chicken, discard marinade, arrange breasts spaced to prevent steaming."
- "Bake 22-28 minutes. Check doneness by feel — meat should be firm, not rubbery. Use thermometer aiming 165°F internal."
- "Remove oven rack briefly, top with tomato and cheese slices, return to oven just long enough for cheese to melt — 3-5 minutes tops."
- "Plate immediately, garnish with basil and balsamic. Sprinkle cheese or smoked salt if desired, finish with fresh black pepper."
- "=== Tips and Troubleshooting ==="
- "If no instant-read thermometer, cut thickest chicken piece to check inside for doneness — clear juices, no pink. Rest chicken 5 mins before cutting helps redistribute juices; juicy, not dry."
- "Substitute Italian dressing with homemade mix: 1/4 cup olive oil, 2 tbsp white vinegar, minced garlic, pinch oregano and crushed red pepper flakes. Marinate at least 2 hours."
- "Roasting tomatoes brings sweetness but fresh ones add brightness. If using fresh, slice thin and layer atop after cooking, then broil cheese only."
- "If grill flare-ups occur, move chicken away immediately and watch carefully for burning."
- "Avoid overcrowding baking dish to promote even cooking and slight browning, not soggy steamed chicken."
- "Use sharp knife to slice cheese thinly for faster melting; burrata breaks down quicker than mozzarella."
- "Balsamic glaze can be replaced with aged sherry vinegar reduction or a good quality store-bought syrup drizzled sparingly."
- "Finished chicken should look glossy from olive oil, cheese bubbling gently. Aromas of roasted tomato, garlic, and basil should be evident right at the grill or straight out of oven."
introduction: "Marinate chicken in Italian dressing plus kosher salt for hours up to almost a day. Don't rush this step; flavor seeps in better this way. Grill or oven-roast, but always aim for that clear juice test and squishy yet firm meat. Cheese on top should soften, not flood the plate with melt. Basil fresh from fridge never fails to brighten the whole dish when added last minute. Use balsamic reduction sparingly — it’s concentrated and punchy, not a heavy syrup for drowning. Toss optional cheese or high-quality salt as final accents. Timing varies; always watch and feel. Cooking isn’t timing alone, it’s about reading the meat’s signals and responding. Sizzle doesn’t lie. Smell changes. Touch changes. Trust those to avoid a chewy, flavorless chicken."
ingredientsNote: "Use boneless, trimmed chicken breasts for even cooking and quick marinating. Italian dressing is a shortcut for acid, oil, and herbs in one, but homemade vinaigrette works just as well and lets you control salt and heat. Kosher salt brings out juices, don't skip it. Roasted tomatoes add sweetness and concentrated acidity; swap fresh heirlooms if you want brighter notes but expect less softness. Burrata is creamier and melts faster than mozzarella, try that for a richer texture. Basil is always best fresh; swap for mint or oregano for interesting twists. Balsamic glaze—homemade reduction or store-bought—adds balanced sweetness and acidity, a thin drizzle is enough. Pecorino or smoked cheese adds depth and salt bite. Maldon flaky salt or smoked salt are easy finishes to boost texture and flavor, sprinkle at end."
instructionsNote: "Always discard marinade after chicken is removed to avoid food safety risks. Shaking excess marinade off ensures grilling without flare-ups or steaming. Oil grill grates well to prevent chicken sticking; use paper towel dipped in oil and tongs to rub grates before heating. Indirect heat prevents overcharring before interior cooks. Several thickness-dependent checks during grilling prevent drying: use thermometer or visual cues like firm texture and clear juices. Rest chicken post-cooking for even juice distribution and easier slicing. Melting cheese on residual heat or with closed grill/oven is the gentlest approach to avoid burning cheese before chicken is done. Balsamic glaze should be drizzled cold on plated chicken to avoid too much evaporated acidity. Adjust oven time slightly based on chicken size and pan material. Crowding pan traps moisture and causes steaming rather than roasting, resulting in rubbery textures. Final seasoning with fresh pepper and salty cheese rounds out flavors just before serving."
tips:
- "Marinate chicken well. Flexibility in time, 2 to 20 hours. Over-marination? Soft chicken, under-seasoned too. Flavors seep in deeper, but balance is key."
- "For an even grill, remember, indirect heat matters. Avoid flare-ups. Oil grates, don’t overcrowd. Searing leads to great crust. Smell the aroma; it's crucial."
- "Tomatoes can be fresh or roasted. Fresh adds brightness, roasted deepens flavor. Late additions to cheese? Thinly slice for faster melt; watch carefully."
- "Check doneness before overcooking. Clear juices, firm texture. Use thermometer if you have one. It's not just timing; feel the meat change. Juicy chicken."
- "For a sharper finish, try pecorino or smoked salt. Adds depth to the experience. Flaky sea salt gives a texture pop. But sprinkle last minute."
faq:
- "q: What if I don’t have Italian dressing? a: Mix olive oil, vinegar, garlic, oregano. Give it time to marinate for best results. Season well."
- "q: Got leftovers? a: Store in an airtight container, fridge for a few days. Reheat gently to avoid dryness. Or slice for salads, wraps."
- "q: What if my chicken is rubbery? a: Likely overcooked; timing can be misleading. Clear juices and firm texture are best signs. Adjust grill time."
- "q: Can I use other herbs? a: Yes, basil’s great but try mint or oregano too. Ground herbs or fresh, mix into the marinade as you wish."
