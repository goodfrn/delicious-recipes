ingredients:
- "1 1/4 pounds beef sirloin sliced thin"
- "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour divided"
- "2 tablespoons vegetable oil divided"
- "1/3 cup dry white wine"
- "8 ounces cremini mushrooms sliced"
- "1 medium white onion diced"
- "1/2 teaspoon black pepper"
- "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "3/4 teaspoon smoked paprika"
- "1 1/4 cups beef stock divided"
- "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard"
- "1 cup green beans trimmed and halved"
- "1 cup frozen peas thawed"
- "1/2 cup sour cream"
- "2 tablespoons unsalted butter"
- "3 scallions sliced"
- "12 ounces egg noodles cooked"
- "2 tablespoons fresh parsley chopped"
instructions:
- "Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large skillet over medium-high. Toss beef with 2 tablespoons flour and season lightly. Brown half beef in skillet until edges just start to crisp, about 4 minutes. Remove. Add remaining oil, repeat with rest. Remove beef, keep warm."
- "Pour white wine into skillet. Scrape pan bottom vigorously to lift fond, sizzle and smell rich. Cook off alcohol bubbles until faint aroma, 1-2 minutes."
- "Add mushrooms, onion, pepper, salt, paprika. Stir often until mushrooms release moisture and reduce by half; edges turn golden. Around 4-5 minutes. If mushrooms steam not brown, too crowded; give space or high heat."
- "Whisk 1/3 cup beef stock with remaining 1 tablespoon flour and Dijon mustard till smooth. Pour slurry and remaining stock into pan. Lower heat to medium-low. Stir constantly scraping any stuck bits. Sauce will thicken gradually; when thick enough to coat back of spoon with slight resistance, ready."
- "Add green beans and peas. Stir through. Cook 2-3 minutes till beans tender-crisp, peas warmed. Fold in sour cream and butter chunks off heat to avoid curdling. Stir in scallions."
- "Return beef, toss gently in sauce until coated. Heat 2 minutes more but do not boil; you want tender beef, no toughness."
- "Serve beef mushroom mixture over hot egg noodles. Sprinkle parsley atop for brightness and herbal notes."
introduction: "Beef searing is not just about color, it's about flavor. That crust holds juices hostage. Tossing slices in flour adds grip, thickens sauce later. Work in batches or you steam beef - no caramel, only soggy meat. Deglazing with white wine drops acidity, brightens but watch the hiss, no burnt remnants. Mushrooms need space; they release water then shrink, that transformation unlocks deep umami scent, edges dry and crisping tell you they’ve done their work. Sauce thickening is a slow stir game — whisk slurry smoothly, add cold stock to avoid lumps, keep heat medium-low to prevent floury grit. Green beans add snap, peas sweetness, sour cream cools the pan and butter rounds edges. Tucking beef back at the end prevents overcooking. Toss noodles with beef to catch every bit of sauce."
ingredientsNote: "Switched sherry for dry white wine: easier swap, similar acidity, more approachable in most kitchens. Sour cream instead of Greek yogurt to keep that classic tang without risk of curdling too fast under heat. Flour quantity bumped slightly for thicker coating; stirring slurry smooth before adding crucial or you'll end with lumps. Added green beans for crunch and fresh contrast against creamy sauce; can sub with asparagus or snap peas. Use fresh herbs like parsley and scallions to cut richness. Butter finish adds silkiness. When out of beef broth, chicken broth or diluted bouillon works, but flavor less assertive. Vegetable oil neutral, but olive oil or clarified butter good alternatives if careful with smoke points."
instructionsNote: "Heat management is king. Medium-high for sear, but no flare-ups. If pan smoking prematurely, lower heat or use a thicker skillet. Remove beef in batches to avoid steaming—crowding is enemy number one. Deglazing requires immediate liquid add after beef removal, so keep wine ready. Watch mushrooms shrink instead of just soften; moisture release signals cooking progress. If sauce lumpy, whisk slurry again separately, add in smaller increments and stir relentlessly. Avoid boiling sauce after cream addition—sharp heat breaks dairy proteins. Always toss beef in sauce off direct high heat, just enough to warm through. Egg noodles best freshly cooked and drained, add a splash of oil to avoid clumping. Garnish late for fresh herb aroma and visual pop."
tips:
- "Searing beef is about color yes, but flavor too. Flour on beef holds juices. Toss in batches; avoid steaming. Key mistakes—liquid in hot pan need to be careful!"
- "Deglazing with white wine brightens sauce, big aromas waft up. Watch heat; alcohol bubbles need to clear! If pan too hot, risk charred remnants. Keep an eye."
- "When mushrooms hit the skillet, space is crucial. They release moisture; edges will brown. Visual signals tell all; golden edges mean progress. If limp, too crowded."
- "For thickening sauce, whisk slurry with cold stock first. No lumps. Heat medium-low or risk grit. Stir constantly; watch for just the right coat on a spoon."
- "Adding cream or yogurt off heat is major—prevents curdling. Toss beef back in gently. Keep temp lower to avoid toughness. Creaminess should coat without separation."
faq:
- "q: How to make it gluten-free? a: Swap flour for cornstarch in slurry. Use gluten-free noodles or cauli rice. Sauce thickens just fine, similar method."
- "q: What if my sauce is too thin? a: Add more slurry, mix slowly till it thickens. If lumps form, re-whisk. Heat gently; don’t rush the process."
- "q: Can I store leftovers? a: Cool completely, keep in airtight. Fridge up to three days. For longer, freeze in portions, thaw overnight. Reheat low and slow."
- "q: Alternatives for green beans? a: Snap peas or asparagus work great; both add crunch. Adjust cook times. Fresh herbs always bring bright notes; keep handy."
