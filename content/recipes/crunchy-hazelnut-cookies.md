slug: "crunchy-hazelnut-cookies"
description: "Nutty, crumbly cookies with a semi-sweet spread swirl. Uses browned butter for depth, ground almonds for texture. Replaced tartinade with walnut butter. Lower oven temp, longer bake for better caramelization. Freeze dough balls to preserve shape. Crackles on edges tell when ready. Works with vegan butter and flax egg. Toast nuts till golden, not burned. Mix carefully to keep swirls distinct. A rustic take on nut cookies with a twist of spice and crunch."

ingredients:
- "115 ml butter unsalted browned and slightly cooled"
- "140 ml packed dark brown sugar"
- "1 ml fine sea salt"
- "1 flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed + 3 tbsp water, rested 5 min)"
- "190 ml unbleached all-purpose flour"
- "125 ml toasted hazelnuts coarsely chopped"
- "60 ml walnut butter spread"
- "1 ml ground cinnamon"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 180 C (350 F). Arrange racks to middle. Line two baking sheets with parchment or silicone mats. Browning butter adds nuttiness and slightly nuttier aroma. Watch carefully, remove at golden brown foamy stage."
- "Lightly toast hazelnuts on dry pan till edges just turn golden and smell fragrant. Coarsely chop; don’t pulverize or lose crunch."
- "In large bowl, combine browned butter and dark brown sugar. Use electric mixer on medium speed to cream until sugar dissolves well and mixture looks glossy, about 3 minutes. Scrape sides to incorporate."
- "Add flax egg and cinnamon. Mix till consistent but don’t overbeat; want some body to dough, not batter. Stir in flour and hazelnuts gently with wooden spoon, just enough to blend. Preserve texture and nut pieces; overmixing creates tough cookies."
- "Spoon walnut butter in random thin lines on dough surface; avoid folding in. Creates the marbled, rustic look once baked."
- "Use 25 ml (1 1/2 tablespoons) scoop or two spoons to form uniform dough balls. Space 5 cm apart for spreading. Optional: Freeze balls on trays 30 minutes to firm, stops excess spreading and preserves swirl effect. Store frozen up to 3 months sealed in freezer bags."
- "Bake sheets one at a time for 10 to 12 minutes. Edges will ripple and sound crackling under tap; centers remain soft but not wet. Smell rich toasted nuts and caramel. Let cool on tray 10 min to set structures before transfer. Cookies firm further while cooling."
- "If bottoms brown unevenly, swap racks or cut bake time slightly next batch. Too soft centers means more time or slightly lower heat."
- "Store fully cooled cookies in airtight container at room temp up to 5 days. Can freeze after baked too if sealed well."
introduction: "Brown butter changes everything. Forget bland, waxy dough. This gets nutty depth you want in hazelnut cookies. Crunch from toasted nuts. Swirls of walnut butter instead of commonplace chocolate spread; richer, earthier. You don’t stir in, you drizzle to keep those pockets. Fold it in and lose all contrast. Temperature matters — dropped it 20 degrees Celsius, baking a bit slower, letting sugars caramelize gently, not burn. Texture mistakes? Overmix flour messes the crumb. Undermix and nuts sink or no structure. Flax egg keeps it moist but vegan-friendly if you want. Quick toast in a dry pan releases aromas, but watch for burnt bits. These smell like success halfway through. Freeze dough balls, saves time on busy days, bakes consistently every time. Cookie edges should crackle on touch and smell toasted but soft centers stay chewy. Real cookies, no shortcuts."
ingredientsNote: "Butter browned, not just softened, boosts nuttiness and aroma, helps develop flavor over regular softened butter. Use dark brown sugar for deeper molasses notes; white sugar yields flat-tasting cookies. Flax egg replaces real egg without sacrificing texture; great allergy option. Ground cinnamon adds subtle warm spice, elevates nuts rather than overpowering. Toast your hazelnuts just lightly until they pop with fragrance — avoid scorched or bitter. Walnut butter brings complexity and earthiness versus sweet hazelnut spreads; swap if unavailable with almond butter, but adjust sweetness accordingly. Use reliable unbleached flour for predictable gluten structure. Keep nuts chopped roughly for satisfying bite variation. Accurate measuring of ingredients is key — flour scooped too densely makes dry crumb. Cooling dough before baking controls spread but freezing is better for holding shape indefinitely. Parchment or silicone mats protect pans and ensure even bottom crisping."
instructionsNote: "Browning butter demands vigilance. On medium heat, swirl pan to avoid brown spots; remove when foam subsides and butter turns amber gold, smells nutty. Don’t wait or you get burnt flavor. Toast nuts in dry skillet over medium heat, shake frequently, stop at first golden smell, no more than 5 minutes. Cream butter and sugar until sugar is nearly dissolved, mixture shiny and lighter, ensures even sugar distribution and tenderness. Add flax egg and cinnamon, fold just until homogeneous, then add flour and nuts gently to keep texture. Drizzle walnut butter over dough surface instead of mixing in preserves marbled effect. Scoop dough quickly for uniform size to ensure consistent baking — uneven sizes bake unevenly. Freeze dough balls spaced apart on sheet to quick chill, then transfer to sealed bags. Bake on middle rack one tray at a time; rotating trays avoids uneven baking. Look for edges firm and crackling to touch but centers slightly soft and glossy; residual heat finishes cooking. Cooling cookies on tray is not optional; they’re fragile hot and need time for fats to firm. Adjust bake time slightly next batches depending on your oven quirks and rack placement."
tips:
- "Brown the butter really watched, swirl pan. Remove when amber gold. Nuttiness isn't just aroma; it’s flavors depth. Careful; burnt flavor ruins."
- "Toast hazelnuts briefly in dry pan. Watch for first golden edges. Smell means ready. Don’t burn. Don’t pulverize — need crunch. Keep chunks."
- "Cream butter and sugar until glossy. Sugar needs to dissolve well. 3 minutes electric mixer; even texture matters; create tender cookies. No grit."
- "Add flax egg after sugar mixture; don’t overblend. Mix just enough to keep dough body. Stir gently in flour and hazelnuts; avoid tough cookies."
- "Scoop dough evenly for uniform baking. Dough balls 5 cm apart; they spread. Freeze if time allows; helps maintain shape, good for busy days."
faq:
- "q: What's the best way to store these cookies? a: Airtight container at room temp max 5 days. Can freeze after baked too, good for a month."
- "q: What if my cookies spread too much? a: Try chilling dough longer; freeze! Or adjust oven temp down slightly. Too warm dough causes issues."
- "q: I need substitutions for hazelnuts? a: Almonds work fine; chop roughly. Same texture, different flavor. Adjust sweetness if using sweet spread."
- "q: What if they’re too soft in center? a: More bake time; every oven varies. Check edges crackling; allows soft centers finish cooking."
