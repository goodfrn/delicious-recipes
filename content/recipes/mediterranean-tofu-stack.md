ingredients:
- "1 block firm tofu about 300 g (10 oz)"
- "100 ml olive oil"
- "3 cloves garlic minced fine"
- "2 green onions chopped small"
- "2 tbsp fresh thyme chopped"
- "2 tbsp tamari sauce (gluten-free soy sauce)"
- "3 tbsp sherry vinegar"
- "1 medium zucchini"
- "1 red bell pepper cut into 4 strips"
- "1 yellow bell pepper cut into 4 strips"
- "Salt and black pepper"
- "50 ml fresh mint chopped"
instructions:
- "1. Slice tofu vertically into 5 slabs around 1 cm thick. Avoid crumbling by pressing firm tofu well to expel excess water a few hours ahead or overnight wrapped in paper towels with weights on top."
- "2. Combine olive oil, garlic, green onions, thyme, tamari, and sherry vinegar in a bowl, whisk briefly to emulsify. Pour marinade over tofu slabs in a flat container. Cover and refrigerate minimum 20 hours but no more than 30 to prevent tofu becoming mushy."
- "3. Preheat grill or barbecue to medium-high heat until hot enough to hear that sizzle when food hits the grates. Oil grates lightly to prevent sticking but avoid fat flare-ups."
- "4. Cut zucchini into diagonal slices about 1 cm thick, aim for even size so grilling is uniform. Add zucchini and bell pepper strips into the marinade bowl. Toss gently to coat all surfaces. Salt and pepper the vegetables now to draw out moisture and elevate flavor."
- "5. Remove tofu and veggies from marinade letting most excess drip off (reserve marinade to serve). Place tofu and vegetables on grill. Grill tofu for 2 to 4 minutes each side or until grill marks appear, edges curling slightly. Vegetables take about 4 to 6 minutes depending on grill heat and thickness, flip once halfway. Look for softened flesh yet firmness retained, peppers with cracked skin, zucchini turning translucent at edges."
- "6. To assemble layer pieces in this order tofu slice, zucchini, pepper. Stack high but stable. Spoon reserved marinade over stacks sparingly to avoid sogginess."
- "7. Garnish with chopped fresh mint. Serve warm or at room temperature as vibrant starter or light main dish."
introduction: "Firm tofu. Marinating overnight lets it soak up that punchy blend of oil, garlic, bright tamari, and vinegar—a little tang cuts the richness. Zucchini sliced on the bias—keeps them juicy yet firm after grill. Bell peppers add sweetness plus charred smoky notes. Tofu and veggies grilled carefully on hot grate for crisp grill marks without falling apart, turning vibrant colors and that irresistible aroma. Layering creates a neat stack, colors layered—nice contrast and bite every mouthful. Fresh mint brightens up the dish, lifts it from heavy to fresh. No dairy nuts or eggs here so allergy-friendly. Makes a fresh starter or light dinner with a crusty bread, drink a bold white. Forget tofu disasters—pressed, marinated right, and grilled hot it’s a whole new game."
ingredientsNote: "Firm tofu the only reliable kind here, pressing essential to prevent mushy results and keep slices intact without crumbling on grill. Use olive oil for richness and smooth mouthfeel but adjust quantity if low fat needed. Switched oregano to thyme and balsamic vinegar to sherry vinegar for a sharper tang. Tamari preferred over regular soy for gluten-free and deeper umami punch. Zucchini sliced thick so it grills without falling apart or going too soft. Bell peppers quartered instead of sixths for easier stuffing and neat stacking. Mint replaces basil providing fresh cool contrast. If short on fresh herbs dried versions can substitute but reduce quantity by half as flavors concentrate. If no sherry vinegar, white wine vinegar or lemon juice works though acidity shifts flavor profile. Marination time minimum 20 hours to get good flavor depth; shorter times yield less infused tofu. High heat grill ensures caramelization instead of steaming. Reserve marinade to drizzle rather than to soak or the stack becomes soggy. If no grill use grill pan over stove but watch for sticking and uneven marks."
instructionsNote: "Slice tofu carefully after pressing to get firm thick slabs; thin slices tear. Marinate long to let juices soak in but limit to a day to prevent texture loss. Mixing marinade by whisking incorporates garlic and herbs suspended evenly rather than settling. Toss vegetables directly in marinade to coat quickly before grilling; adds flavor inside and out. Preheat grill fully—temperature control critical. Oil grates slightly to prevent sticking but not oily pools that cause flare-ups and charring. Turn tofu gently with spatula, don’t prod or flip too soon or tofu sticks or breaks. Watch veggies for softened but not mushy texture signaled by slight translucence and char patches. Keep stacking ordered to maintain structure and balanced flavor distribution. Use reserved marinade at service not cooking; avoids wet soggy food and intensifies flavors fresh. Garnish last minute to retain herb brightness and aroma. Pairing with crisp bread soaks up marinade drips and complements smoky, acidic profile. Double batch if hungry, stacks hold shape well on plate or platter. Good to eat warm, room temp is acceptable but avoid cold. If no BBQ indoors, heat grill pan until near smoking and use moderate oil so no smoking out kitchen."
tips:
- "Press firm tofu for hours before slicing—releases water, helps keep texture. This helps prevent mushiness when grilling. 1 cm slabs, keep intact."
- "Marination time is key. Minimum 20 hours. Keep an eye on texture, beyond 30 hours risks over-soaking. Flavors deepen but watch the tofu."
- "Grill preheating matters. Medium-high heat should sizzle food and create that perfect char. Oil grates lightly before placing food, prevents sticking."
- "Cut veggies uniformly. Zucchini and peppers should grill evenly. Diagonal cuts on zucchini help retain firmness, chopped sizes retain flavors, textures."
- "Reserved marinade only after grilling. Drizzle it on stacks right before serving. Avoid soggy stacks. Keeps flavors bright without excess moisture."
faq:
- "q: How do I store leftover veggie stacks? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. Lasts 3-5 days. Reheat gently or eat cold. Grilled veggies hold better than tofu."
- "q: Can I use other vegetables? a: Yes, bell peppers, eggplant, mushrooms work well. Adjust grilling time based on vegetable texture. Just ensure even cuts."
- "q: What if my tofu crumbles? a: Pressing enough is crucial. Too much handling can break, avoid flipping too soon. Use a spatula, not fingers."
- "q: What if I don’t have sherry vinegar? a: White wine vinegar works in a pinch. Lemon juice is another substitute. Different tang but adjusts flavors a bit, not drastic."
