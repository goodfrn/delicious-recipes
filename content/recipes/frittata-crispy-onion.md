description: "Oven-finished egg dish loaded with caramelized onions and crushed chips. Uses Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, swaps chives for fresh parsley. Onions cooked until deeply golden and sweet, eggs soak up the crunch and moisture, baked just till set. Caramelization brings a rich aroma, chips add unexpected texture. A satisfying vegetarian main, gluten-free, nut-free, with a bright herb finish. Timing hinges on visual cues—golden edges and a slightly puffed center signal doneness. Simple ingredients; technique-focused, relying on tactile doneness rather than the clock alone."

ingredients:
- "2 large yellow onions thinly sliced"
- "40 ml unsalted butter (about 3 tbsp)"
- "7 large eggs"
- "90 g lightly crushed plain potato chips (about 2 1/2 cups)"
- "80 ml plain Greek yogurt (slightly less than 1/3 cup)"
- "30 ml chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley"
- "Salt"
- "Freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 175° C (350° F). Position oven rack mid-level to ensure even baking."
- "Heat a 23 cm (9 in) nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add butter, melt until foaming then toss in onions."
- "Cook onions stirring almost constantly to prevent scorching. After about 12 minutes the onions should darken to a deep amber, smelling sweet and nutty. Salt and pepper lightly to draw out moisture."
- "Remove skillet from heat. Distribute onions evenly over the pan bottom. The visual of glossy, richly colored strands signals readiness."
- "Meanwhile, break eggs into a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Whisk until combined but not frothy."
- "Fold in crushed chips and let mixture rest 4 minutes so chips absorb some moisture but retain crunch pockets."
- "Pour egg-chip blend gently over onions, tilting pan to level. Let sit on stove 2–3 minutes over very low heat — no stirring — to start setting edges, audible gentle sizzling and subtle bubbling."
- "Transfer skillet to oven promptly. Bake 12–15 minutes or until frittata is puffed, edges golden and center set — test by gently shaking pan; no liquid should jiggle."
- "Remove from oven. Let cool 3 minutes, then cut into wedges."
- "Top each serving with dollops of Greek yogurt and sprinkle fresh parsley. The yogurt adds tang and creamy contrast, parsley brings fresh herbal brightness."
- "Serve with crisp green salad dressed simply. If ovenproof pan unavailable, transfer onions to baking dish and use a separate skillet for eggs, adjust cooking time accordingly."
introduction: "Onions caramelized slowly in butter, darkening to a rich amber—this is the backbone. Layers of flavor built through patient heat and steady stirring. Throw in crushed potato chips not for salt or fat, but crunch that pokes through the soft egg custard. Greek yogurt swaps sour cream to cut richness with tang and trim calories. Parsley swaps chives for a sharper, greener note. Egg mixture rests, chips soak slightly but retain texture—not mush. Baking achieves a gently puffed structure that holds without drying. No rushing. Knowing when the center is just set, edges kissed golden—that's the cue. No timer slavishness. A practical, textured frittata designed to surprise with humble ingredients. Eat warm or room temp. Turns simple pantry staples into a memorable, layered dish with contrast—the sweet bite of onion, the crisp mouthfeel surprise, creamy tart counterpoint."
ingredientsNote: "Onions are key; yellow or sweet varieties work best for deep caramelization. Slice uniformly for even cooking. Butter is essential for flavor, but olive oil works if you prefer, just expect a different aroma. Eggs: use large, fresh for better texture. Potato chips: unflavored plain types best—seasoned chips risk overpowering or weird flavor notes. Crush them lightly; too fine and you lose crunch. Greek yogurt replaces sour cream for tang with less fat and a milder flavor, but sour cream can be used if preferred. Parsley substitutes chives—parsley adds freshness and a slight bitterness that counterbalances sweetness. Salt and freshly cracked pepper are essential—season onions and eggs well or dish falls flat. If gluten is not a concern, use kettle-cooked chips for extra crunch. For dairy-free, swap butter with oil and yogurt with coconut or cashew-based alternatives, but no guarantee on texture."
instructionsNote: "Caramelizing onions requires patience. The changing color and smell are your indicators—don't rush. Stir nearly constantly to avoid burning; scrape bits stuck to pan to develop fond, adding to flavor. When onions reach a translucent gold turning to deep amber, they're done. Egg mixture: whisk well but not overly; you want a uniform texture but not foamy. Chips need soak time but not long—around 4 minutes to soften edges so they integrate but keep crunchy interiors. Pour eggs gently over onions, tilt pan to distribute evenly; this avoids layering and dry spots. Initial two minutes on stove over low heat start setting base—look for edges firming but center still wobbly. Oven baking finishes cooking without overcooking edges—visual cues here matter more than strict time. Gently shake skillet to test doneness. Let frittata rest briefly out of oven; residual heat finishes cooking, making cutting cleaner. Use an offset spatula or sharp knife for clean wedges. Garnishing with yogurt or sour cream brings cool contrast to warm eggs. Fresh herbs added last preserve aroma and bright flavor. If you don't have an ovenproof skillet, transfer onions to baking dish and gently pour eggs on top, adjust baking time slightly longer."
tips:
- "Use yellow onions; they caramelize well. Go slow on heat. Watch for deep amber color; smell changes too. Key indicators for doneness. Keep stirring."
- "Eggs should be large and fresh; crucial for fluffiness. Whisk lightly, blend but don’t foam.  Too much air alters texture, won’t set right."
- "Crushed chips need rest time; about 4 minutes works. Absorb moisture yet stay crunchy inside. Avoid fine crumbs; lose all texture. Focus on light crushing."
- "Oven time varies; consider visual cues. Edges golden while center is set. Gentle shake—no jiggle means done. Watch closely; stay by the oven."
- "Garnish matters; yogurt adds tang and creaminess. Don’t skip fresh parsley; brightens flavors. Consider alternatives if needed, but keep balance in mind."
faq:
- "q: What's the trick for caramelizing? a: Patience is key. Low heat. Stir often; watch closely. Color shifts from translucent to amber. Smell changes too. Keep an eye."
- "q: How do I store leftover frittata? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. It’ll last a few days. Reheat gently to avoid drying out. Can also be eaten cold."
- "q: Can't find Greek yogurt? a: Substitute with sour cream if needed. Lower fat but slightly different flavor. Non-dairy options are available too. Try coconut yogurt."
- "q: Chips lost crunch after baking? a: Didn’t wait long enough or crushed too fine. Focus on size; should absorb some moisture but retain bite. Check chip type too."
