ingredients:
- "1 tablespoon chipotle powder"
- "1 teaspoon ground cumin"
- "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1 teaspoon granulated garlic"
- "1 teaspoon onion powder"
- "1/2 teaspoon dried oregano"
- "1 teaspoon smoked paprika"
- "1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper"
- "1/4 teaspoon ground coriander"
- "1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper"
instructions:
- "Mix chipotle powder, cumin, kosher salt, granulated garlic, onion powder, oregano, smoked paprika, black pepper, ground coriander and cayenne together in a small bowl."
- "Taste and tweak salt or cayenne if needed. Remember, seasoning is personal."
- "Store mix dry in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. Keeps up to 6 months if sealed tight."
- "Use as a rub on meats or sprinkle on vegetables before roasting or grilling. Adjust amounts to taste, start small."
- "If substituting, smoked paprika can be swapped with regular paprika for less smokiness, and cayenne can be omitted or doubled depending on heat tolerance."
introduction: "Scratch-made seasoning saves time in the kitchen. Buying pre-packaged mixes means mystery ingredients and salt overload. Grinding your own spice blend? Control every pinch. Chipotle powder swaps in for chili powder — less generic heat, more smokiness, complexity. Ground coriander adds a faint citrus lift that cuts through the heavier cumin and smoked paprika layers. Don't skip the kosher salt — it’s the bridge that pulls everything together, seasoning everything evenly. No need for fancy equipment, just dry ingredients and a handful of minutes. Store sealed airtight. No humidity or light allowed, or the spices lose pungency fast. Ready to shake, sprinkle, rub — instant flavor bomb that doesn't rely on sauce. Got leftover chicken or taco meat? This mix revives blandness with minimal effort."
ingredientsNote: "For cumin, freshly ground whole seeds work best but pre-ground is fine if you're careful with freshness. Granulated garlic has a punchier flavor and better shelf life than garlic powder — worth seeking out. Smoked paprika is key here; if you don’t have it, regular paprika will turn this into a sweeter, less smoky profile. Dried oregano should be crushed between your fingers before mixing to release oils — don’t just dump it in whole. Ground coriander is an optional but valuable addition that brings brightness, so don’t skip unless you hate the flavor. Cayenne pepper is variable — start small if you’re heat sensitive, add more after mixing if desired. Kosher salt is easier to measure accurately than table salt, but adjust accordingly if substituting."
instructionsNote: "Combining powders dry is straightforward but be precise with measuring — too much salt or cayenne can overpower. Use a shallow bowl and whisk or fork to fully blend, no clumps. Tasting raw seasoning should give you a decent sense of the final impact, but remember it's concentrated and will mellow on meat. Store immediately in a small jar with a tight-fitting lid; don’t leave exposed to air or light or the blend will degrade quickly. Use a dry spoon or measuring spoon to avoid introducing moisture, which causes caking. When applying, pat on with fingers or rub in, avoid dumping; even coverage is key to balanced flavor distribution. Ideal for spicing up tacos, burritos, roasted vegetables, grilled proteins, anything missing that depth with minimal fuss."
tips:
- "Adjust cayenne based on tolerance. Not all like heat. Start small, add more later. Easier to control heat with less than too much. Go easy."
- "Fresh spices have more punch; store carefully. Light and air make them lose strength. Use airtight jars. Keeps flavor; enjoy every pinch. Check dates."
- "Granulated garlic over garlic powder — stronger flavor. Good shelf life, worth getting. Flavor profile changes with dried herbs; crush before adding."
- "If out of smoked paprika, use regular. Sweeter, less smoky flavor. Chipotle spice is different — crucial for that depth. Try adjusting quantities."
- "Ideal for tacos, but consider other uses; burritos, grilled veggies, or meats. Shake, sprinkle, rub it in. Adjust according to your taste. Even coverage helps."
faq:
- "q: How to tweak spice levels? a: Start with smaller amounts. Drastic changes can overpower. Taste at the end. Adjust as needed. Go slow..."
- "q: Any alternatives for key ingredients? a: Replace coriander with cumin. Skip cayenne or use a different pepper. Smoked paprika can swap with regular."
- "q: How to store the mix properly? a: Store in cool dark. Airtight container works best. Avoid moisture and light. Spice life is precious; treat them right."
- "q: What if it clumps? a: Use a dry spoon; helps avoid moisture. Break clumps with fingers or a whisk. Clumps mean loss of flavor. Fix it fast."
