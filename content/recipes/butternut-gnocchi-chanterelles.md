ingredients:
- "=== Gnocchi ==="
- "1 medium butternut squash"
- "30 g (1/4 cup) pecorino romano, finely grated"
- "1 egg yolk"
- "Pinch of ground nutmeg"
- "210 g (1 2/3 cups) all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) avocado oil"
- "=== Topping ==="
- "75 g (1/3 cup) guanciale diced small"
- "25 g (1 1/2 tbsp) unsalted butter"
- "85 g (3/4 cup) chanterelle mushrooms"
- "2 small shallots, finely minced"
- "1 clove garlic, minced"
- "120 ml (1/2 cup) Prosecco or dry white wine"
- "1 small yellow zucchini, thinly sliced into ribbons"
- "20 g (1/2 cup) Italian flat-leaf parsley, chopped"
- "20 g (1/2 cup) fresh basil, chopped"
- "60 g (1/3 cup) smoked almonds, roughly chopped"
- "4 egg yolks, room temperature"
- "Parmesan shavings"
instructions:
- "=== Gnocchi ==="
- "1. Oven rack center. Preheat to 185°C (365°F). Line tray with parchment paper."
- "2. Halve the butternut squash lengthwise; scrape seeds out. Season flesh with salt and pepper. Place cut side down on the tray. Roast about 50 minutes, or til the flesh is easily pierced by a knife and sounds slightly hollow when tapped. Let cool, no hurry."
- "3. Scoop flesh. Measure roughly 280 ml (1 1/8 cups). Drain on a fine mesh sieve for 45 minutes to pull out excess water; moisture kills gnocchi texture. Chill the squash pulp."
- "4. Fork mash the squash. Stir in pecorino, egg yolk, nutmeg, salt. Gradually fold in flour, avoiding overwork to prevent toughness. Dough should come together but stay slightly sticky."
- "5. Lightly flour surface. Knead briefly until smooth and elastic. If sticky, dust more flour sparingly. Wrap in plastic, refrigerate 25 minutes to relax gluten."
- "6. Divide dough into 4 parts. Roll each into logs about 1.5 cm (just over 1/2 inch) diameter. Slice into 2 cm pieces. Dust with flour to prevent sticking."
- "7. Bring large pot salted water to a full boil. Drop gnocchi in batches (don’t crowd). They’ll sink, then float in 2–3 minutes. Scoop with spider, drain well. Toss lightly with avocado oil to prevent clumping. Keep warm on lightly floured tray."
- "=== Topping ==="
- "8. In wide skillet over medium-high heat, render guanciale in butter till crisp and the fat renders out. Sizzle, smell the pork fat caramelizing."
- "9. Add chanterelles, shallots, garlic. Stir and cook till moisture evaporates and mushrooms just start to brown, about 3 minutes. If pan goes dry, add a tablespoon of butter to keep moving."
- "10. Splash Prosecco to deglaze, scraping browned bits from bottom. Let liquor reduce by half."
- "11. Fold in zucchini ribbons, parsley, basil, smoked almonds. Toss in gnocchi. Warm through, coat evenly. Check seasoning; add salt, pepper carefully—guanciale salty."
- "12. Plate gnocchi mixture. Place a warm egg yolk center on each serving. Garnish generously with Parmesan shavings."
- "=== Notes and Tips ==="
- "Drain the squash well or gnocchi fall apart. Don’t over-flour gnocchi logs or final texture gets dense. Using guanciale adds pork depth over pancetta, but bacon is acceptable in pinch, reduce salt elsewhere."
- "Prosecco swap for dry vermouth or light sherry. Smoked almonds add crunch and subtle smokiness; toasted walnuts or pecans can substitute but lose that aroma."
- "If gnocchi feel gluey after cooking, too much moisture. Toss with oil immediately and serve without delay. Egg yolks at room temp meld better and enrich final mouthfeel. Parmesan shards cut through the buttery richness."
- "Gnocchi dough benefit from chilling to rest starch and gluten, keeps them tender. Work quickly once dough’s cold; warm hands melt butter and moisture in dough, making it sticky."
- "Pan must stay hot when cooking topping. Mushrooms release water; key to cook it out completely or topping sogs. Also keep veggies slightly crunchy for contrast."
introduction: "Roasting squash floors you with sweet, nutty flesh that’s naturally hydrated but dangerous if left wet. Gnocchi needs that balance — moisture wrangled out, starch and fat married so each pillowy piece holds shape, not glue. Then crisp pork fat infuses, chanterelles add their forest musk, and whispered Prosecco wakes the pan. A dash of fresh herbs, slick ribbons of zucchini, toasted smoked almonds snap and bark. Egg yolk coins hold richness at the core, Parmesan shards on top peel off salty shards. It’s not complex but demands respect—timing, texture, temperature. Break the rules on flour, hydration, or cooking liquid, it all falls apart. Chops, folds, quick tosses, serve fast. Gnocchi waits for no one."
ingredientsNote: "Substitutions: Pecorino works here instead of Parmesan—sharper, saltier but less sweet. Guanciale imparts smoky pork fat without overwhelming; pancetta’s fine but scale salt. Avocado oil swaps standard olive for higher smoke temp and cleaner finish. Prosecco is nuanced but dry vermouth or even a light cider vinegar splash dilute funk well. Smoked almonds bring concentrated woodsmoke crunch; walnuts or pecans toasted add texture but drop the smoky note. Keep flour measured; too much leads to chew, too little, collapse. Egg yolk crucial—a binder and richness agent, so don’t omit or risk gnocchi crumbling during cooking. Zucchini ribbons add vegetal freshness and lighten dish weight. Chill dough to relax gluten, avoid tough gnocchi."
instructionsNote: "Roast butternut cut-side down to trap steam inside, speeds cooking, caramelizes flesh unevenly, gives depth. Let cool properly before scooping—too hot and you lose moisture control on dough. Drain flesh on sieve at least 45 minutes; longer if squash watery. Use fork mashing, not pureeing; a smooth dough isn’t your goal, slight texture helps final gnocchi mouthfeel. Gradually add flour; add less if you can, extra makes gnocchi chewy. Rest dough in fridge for 25 minutes—chilled dough rolls easier, cuts cleaner. Boiling water should be aggressively rolling, salted like seawater, to season gnocchi inside out. Cooking gnocchi in batches prevents clumping and sticks. Pan for topping must be hot but controlled; guanciale fat must render slowly for crispness, butter prevents burning. Mushrooms and shallots should brown, not steam—adjust pan temp and stir frequency. Deglaze with Prosecco, let alcohol burn off before adding greens and nuts. Toss gnocchi gently but thoroughly to coat. Serve immediately with fresh egg yolks and sharp Parmesan shavings for final hit. Timing here is crucial; yolks sink in if plates wait, gnocchi gum up if cooled too long."
tips:
- "Drain squash well. Water ruins texture. Use fine sieve, set flesh atop. Cooling squash helps prevent moisture."
- "When making gnocchi, avoid over-flouring. Too much flour leads to dense bites. Keep flour on the surface. Work fast; keep dough cool. Warm hands melt fat."
- "Use guanciale for authentic taste. If unavailable, pancetta or bacon can work. Adjust seasoning since guanciale is saltier. Just a pinch more salt."
- "For mushrooms, make sure to cook until browned. If pan starts feeling dry, add butter. Don't steam them. Sauté for flavor. Aim for crunchy zucchini ribbons."
- "Egg yolks are crucial. Room temperature makes them blend with the dish better. Avoid chilling them; they won’t cover gnocchi properly."
faq:
- "q: How to keep gnocchi from falling apart? a: Key step is draining squash well, excess moisture kills texture. Chill dough and work fast."
- "q: What probiotics can I use instead of Prosecco? a: Try dry vermouth or light sherry. Each adds unique flavor depth. Flavor shift but worth it."
- "q: How to store leftover gnocchi? a: Cool completely, then place in airtight container. Refrigerate 2-3 days. Can freeze in batches. Just cook from frozen."
- "q: What if my gnocchi are too sticky? a: Toss in a bit more flour but not too much. If dough too wet, they won’t hold. Work quickly, don’t overthink."
