ingredients:
- "=== Vinaigrette ==="
- "2 small shallots, finely chopped"
- "80 ml olive oil (about 5 tbsp)"
- "25 ml apple cider vinegar (just under 2 tbsp)"
- "3 ml honey (or maple syrup, 3/4 tsp)"
- "Pinch salt and cracked black pepper"
- "=== Salad ==="
- "200 ml plain yogurt (can substitute Greek style or non-dairy unsweetened coconut yogurt)"
- "12 ml dried tarragon (about 2 1/2 tsp)"
- "400 g asparagus, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces"
- "300 g thin haricots verts, trimmed"
- "1 head radicchio, thinly sliced (substitute Belgian endive if needed)"
- "30 g fresh watercress or baby arugula (about 1 cup)"
- "30 g toasted sliced pistachios (can swap almonds, walnuts, or pecans)"
instructions:
- "=== Vinaigrette ==="
- "1. Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in small skillet. Add shallots and cook, stirring frequently, until deep golden brown and crisp at edges, 7-9 minutes. Listen for light sizzling sounds; watch for browning but avoid burning. If it burns, discard and start fresh—you need clean caramelization."
- "2. Remove skillet from heat. Carefully stir in cider vinegar and honey. Return to stove briefly, bring to gentle boil for 10 seconds to marry flavors. Set aside to cool. Season with salt and pepper to taste."
- "=== Salad ==="
- "3. Stir dried tarragon into plain yogurt. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Let rest at room temperature to allow herbs to seep through. If yogurt is thick, loosen with splash of water or milk; it should spread easily."
- "4. Bring large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Prepare ice bath alongside."
- "5. Blanch asparagus until just tender but still firm to bite, about 2-3 minutes depending on thickness. You want a snap when bitten, vibrant green color—overcooking will dull color and turn mushy."
- "6. Immediately transfer asparagus to ice bath with slotted spoon or tongs. This shocks veggies, halts cooking, preserves color and crunch. Drain well and pat dry with kitchen towel."
- "7. Repeat blanching for haricots verts only slightly longer, 3-4 minutes. Same ice plunge, dry off."
- "8. Toss asparagus and haricots verts in medium bowl with half the vinaigrette. Add salt and cracked pepper. Stir gently to coat but not bruise."
- "9. Arrange yogurt spread thin and even on serving plates or shallow bowls."
- "10. Pile blanched greens on top. Scatter sliced radicchio and watercress alongside for bitter brightness and peppery bite."
- "11. Drizzle remaining vinaigrette over everything. Finish liberally with toasted pistachios for crunch and nuttiness."
- "Serve immediately. If making ahead, keep components separate and assemble just before serving to avoid sogginess."
introduction: "Roasting shallots until caramelized and crisp—key flavor foundation here. Watch closely, can turn bitter fast. That sizzle under your spatula, aroma turns nutty, luscious. Vinaigrette needs that punch of acid but balanced with something sweet to tame sharp edges. Tarragon folded into creamy yogurt makes a herby cushion for fresh green veggies. Asparagus and fine haricots verts—blast them briefly in boiling salted water until vibrant green with bite, then shock in ice water—stop those cooking fingers! Texture matters. Throw in some peppery watercress, a sweet bitterness from radicchio instead of the usual endive. Toasted pistachios swap almonds for an earthier, buttery crunch. Timing shifts a bit; trust eyes and bite, not just clock. Keep it bright, keep it clean. Proudly vegetarian, naturally gluten-free, no fuss."
ingredientsNote: "Shallots roasted slowly in olive oil develop deep caramelization but watch carefully—too long, they burn and ruin the vinaigrette. If out of cider vinegar, white wine or rice vinegar can stand in, but reduce quantity slightly to avoid overpowering acidity. Honey or maple syrup softens the sharpness naturally; skip sugar in favor of these more nuanced sweeteners. Yogurt choice changes texture and tang; a thick Greek style saturates but may need thinning. Non-dairy alternative works but flavor weakens. Radicchio adds bitter notes missing from traditional endive—try both to see which punch suits you. Toast nuts just before serving for fresh aroma. Dry roast on skillet, no oil needed, watching constantly to avoid burning. Keep your greens crisp by shocking immediately after blanching; skip ice bath, you’ll lose color and snap. Pistachios swap for almonds or toasted walnuts for a different crunch dimension."
instructionsNote: "First step—get shallots golden, watch color and smell. Stop cooking before dark brown; residual heat finishes the job when vinegar hits. Quick boil after adding vinegar and honey seals flavors fast with minimal cooking time. Layer yogurt and tarragon early to let herb release, but keep cold so it doesn’t separate. Blanch asparagus and haricots verts in same water but sequentially—different cook times. Use tongs, hold for bite test—the snap, color, firmness tell all. Ice bath must be ice cold—don't just use cold tap water. Drain well; water leftover will dilute yolk. Toss veggies gently with half vinaigrette to coat evenly without bruising. Build salad on plates by layering yogurt spread first—helps with serving, keeps salad moist but prevents sogginess. Drizzle remaining vinaigrette last; adds freshness and shine. Sprinkle nuts just before serving to avoid softening. Make components ahead only if needed, assemble fresh—salad softness kills texture. Master these stages, and the salad sings."
tips:
- "Watch shallots closely. Golden color, nutty aroma. Cook too long, they burn. Cool immediately after vinegar. This preserves balance."
- "Use chilled water for ice bath. Stop cooking asparagus, haricots verts instantly. Quick transfer with slotted spoon. Vital for color."
- "Yogurt thickness matters. Greek yogurt? Thin with water or milk. Non-dairy options available but flavor weakens. Stay alert on texture."
- "Toast nuts just before serving. No oil needed. Watch them constantly. Burn quickly! Adds aroma, crunch; freshness is key in dishes."
- "Split blanching times. Asparagus first, haricots verts second. Keep pot boiling. Test snap for doneness. Don’t rush; check color often."
faq:
- "q: Why are shallots important? a: They bring depth and sweetness. Roast until golden. If burnt, flavors turn bitter; better to start over."
- "q: Can I substitute the tarragon? a: Yes, dill or oregano might work. Adjust amounts, taste as you go. Fresh herbs are key."
- "q: What happens if veggies become mushy? a: Shock them! Ice bath halts cooking, preserves crunch. Time is critical, don’t skip."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep components separate. Assemble fresh right before serving. Otherwise, sogginess kills the texture."
