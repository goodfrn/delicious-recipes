- "12 ml (2.5 tsp) toasted sesame oil"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) light soy sauce"
- "6 ml (1.25 tsp) rice vinegar"
- "1 scallion, chopped"
instructions:
- "Bring a pot of water to a boil. Drop in bean sprouts, blanch 45 seconds, not longer."
- "Drain sprouts immediately, cool under cold water to stop cooking."
- "Whisk together toasted sesame seeds, honey, toasted sesame oil, soy sauce, and rice vinegar in a bowl."
- "Add drained sprouts to bowl. Toss well to coat all."
- "Sprinkle scallions on top before serving."
- "Serve chilled or room temperature. Holds well for a few hours in fridge."
introduction: "Bean sprouts barely cooked. Crisp holds. The dressing? Sesame oil with honey instead of sugar, a pinch of soy sour, rice vinegar tang. Quick whip. Toss. Eat soon. Faintly sweet, mildly salty, nuttiness. Green onions burst on top, fresh pop. Subtle salt, not too much, just enough. Not drowned–lifted. Balanced. Ready quick. Clean taste. Feels light. Works cold or just off the fridge. Easy side with rice or grilled tofu. No gluten worries. Vegan. Simple pantry staples mostly. "
ingredientsNote: "Bean sprouts fresh, crisp. Don’t overcook or they get soggy. Toasted sesame seeds add crunch and smoky depth; use pre-toasted or toast lightly until fragrant. Honey replaces brown sugar, blends smoothly, a little sweeter but mellow. Toasted sesame oil is stronger in aroma—used modestly. Soy sauce adds umami, saltiness; pick a light soy for subtle color. Rice vinegar’s sharpness balances sweetness, essential here. Scallions fresh, no wilting, minimum zest and bite. Quantities adjusted slightly bigger portions for better servings, minor tweaking to intensify flavor. Measurements in metric and teaspoon for kitchen ease. "
instructionsNote: "Boil water, quick blanch sprouts 45 seconds, watch carefully or lose crunch. Drain fast, cool immediately, stops cooking, keeps bite. Mixing bowl with pre-made sesame seed blend—whisk honey and vinegar gently with oils, then mix soy in last. Add sprouts, toss thoroughly coating every strand without crushing. Toss gently but wholly. Sprinkle finely chopped scallions right before serving—they wilt quickly. Serve chilled or at room temp, best eaten within few hours, fresh. Hands-on, minimal utensils, no complicated steps, no deep marinating wait. Quick prep but flavors layered. Perfect for last-minute side."
tips:
- "Blanch quickly. Just 45 seconds in boiling water. This keeps the bean sprouts crunchy. Watch closely. Letting them cook longer ruins the texture. Drain them fast. Cool under cold water. Stops cooking immediately."
- "Mix dressing properly. Toasted sesame oil is powerful. Use a small amount only. Whisk honey to blend smoothly. Rice vinegar adds sharpness, balancing sweetness. Try to mix till it’s uniform. Add soy last for flavor depth."
- "Garnish just before serving. Scallions add fresh crispness. Chop finely, sprinkle right on top. They wilt quickly otherwise. A fresh pop for the dish. Balance flavors beautifully. Keep them vibrant."
- "Make ahead but serve fresh. Holds in the fridge for a few hours. Best textures are when eaten soon after making. Flavor develops but the sprouts stay crisp. Eat chilled or at room temp."
- "Experiment with adding spices. A hint of chili flakes can enhance flavor. Tweak to your taste. Garlic or ginger adds depth. Don’t overpower the sesame. Adjust seasoning as needed."
faq:
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Can store in the fridge. Keep in airtight container. Good for up to 2 days. Flavor stays but texture changes. Still edible but crisper when fresh."
- "q: What's a substitute for honey? a: Agave syrup works well. Slightly different flavor. Maple syrup can replace too. Adjust sweetness. Experiment till right taste fits."
- "q: Can I use other vegetables? a: Yes, try carrots or zucchini. Quick blanch all. Same timing as bean sprouts. Makes it colorful. Add variety to your dish."
- "q: What if I don't have sesame oil? a: Can use olive oil but loses that distinct flavor. Peanut oil is another option. Same amount. Not quite the same but tasty."
