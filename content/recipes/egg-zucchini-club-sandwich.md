ingredients:
- "5 large eggs lightly beaten"
- "50 ml (3 1/2 tbsp) chickpea flour"
- "4 medium zucchini slices about 1 cm thick"
- "50 ml (3 1/2 tbsp) avocado oil"
- "12 slices whole grain sandwich bread"
- "125 ml (1/2 cup) tahini paste"
- "Whole grain mustard to taste"
- "8 slices ripe plum tomato"
- "4 leaves romaine lettuce"
- "Salt and cracked black pepper"
- "16 toothpicks"
instructions:
- "Set oven rack mid-level preheat to 190 C (375 F). Lightly grease 20 cm square glass baking dish with oil to prevent sticking."
- "Pour beaten eggs into dish, season with salt and plenty of cracked pepper. Bake for roughly 12 minutes until edges firm up and center no longer jiggles. The surface should look fully set but avoiding dryness. Let cool slightly and cut into four even squares. Flip a spatula under each piece to loosen cleanly without breaking."
- "While eggs bake, dust zucchini slices thinly and evenly with chickpea flour — this adds crisp crust when fried. Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat. Fry zucchini for 3-4 minutes each side until rich golden brown and tender but still retaining bite. Avoid overcrowding; fry in batches if needed. Drain on paper towel briefly."
- "Toast bread slices until golden with slightly crisp edges but still soft center. On one slice per sandwich spread tahini liberally, place one egg square then a zucchini slice. Top with another toasted slice slathered with whole grain mustard, layer with tomato and lettuce. Finish with a final tahini-coated bread slice on top."
- "Secure each sandwich with 4 toothpicks pushed in corners and center to maintain layers. Cut diagonally into triangles. Serve immediately for best textural contrast and fresh flavors."
introduction: "Eggs baked in a glass dish build a firm but tender base - no scrambling fuss, no fragile mess. Clean edges, easy portioning. Zucchini replaces aubergine here because it crisps up beautifully coated in chickpea flour and pan-fried with avocado oil for a mild buttery note. Toast bread slightly thick for better structure. The thickeners play double duty—binding and texture, no soggy spots. Tahini for spread adds deep nutty creaminess; swap hummus for tahini if you want denser richness. Mustard cuts through the fattiness and adds tang; whole grain mustard is my pick, seeds give textural lift and bursts of vinegar tang. Tomato adds fresh juiciness, lettuce snaps under the bite. Keep sandwich layered and firm with toothpicks unless you want it collapsing mid-bite. Quick, fresh, plant-strong, wholesome. Filling, light, crunchy. And that satisfying click of toasted bread."
ingredientsNote: "Chickpea flour used here instead of plain wheat flour for crispiness, slight nutty flavor and gluten-free option. If unavailable, normal all-purpose flour works but absorb oil a bit more making frying heavier. Avocado oil preferred for high smoke point and neutral flavor—can substitute light olive oil or grapeseed oil. Tahini provides creaminess and richness instead of hummus used previously; both plant-based but tahini is silkier, denser. Whole grain mustard is textured and less sharp than Dijon; if you must, Dijon works too but consider adding a sprinkle of mustard seeds for crunch. Zucchini instead of aubergine—faster cooking, less moisture release, better golden crust. Bread should be sturdy but not too dry or the sandwich falls apart; fresh sandwich bread or sourdough lightly toasted is ideal. Lettuce romaine chosen for crunch and resistance to wilting unlike iceberg; both work fine. Tomatoes ripe but firm—too soft will make sandwich soggy fast."
instructionsNote: "Oven-baked eggs firm up without drying when watched closely—the moment they stop jiggling much, poke with fingertip to confirm set but moist. Overbaked eggs get rubbery. Dust zucchini lightly; too thick a coating leads to gummy crust or burns easily. Medium heat frying to develop even color without browning aggressively. Fry in one layer, avoid crowding pans so slices stay crisp, not steaming. Drain on paper towel to remove excess oil but serve quickly before cooling loses surface crunch. Toast bread evenly, keeping interiors soft but edges snaggy. Warm bread absorbs spreads better, prevents sogginess if eaten soon after assembly. Spreading tahini evenly but not dripping take care or sandwich falls apart. Mustard applied on middle slice creates a spicy barrier between fresh layers and moist elements. Multiple layers balanced—don't overstuff or sandwich collapses; toothpicks essential. Cut into triangles, tidy bites. Serve at once for crunch and fresh taste; leftovers can be wrapped but lose crispness fast."
tips:
- "For frying zucchini, make sure slices are not too thick; thin even dusting of chickpea flour leads to that ideal crisp. Aim for golden brown - if too pale, not cooked enough. Too dark? Overdone."
- "Eggs baking: Keep a close eye. When edges firm and center just set, it's time. Test with a gentle poke. Watch closely—too long and they'll become rubbery. Measure oven properly; your timer is not enough. Oven temperatures vary."
- "Bread choice is key. Good texture adds to sandwich structure. Look for fresh stuff; dry bread falls apart. After toasting, spread tahini first on one slice, then mustard on another for flavor contrast."
- "Assemble layers wisely. Too much filling and things will tumble out when bitten. Keep it firm but not overstuffed. Use the toothpicks well—otherwise it’ll turn into a messy plate of sandwiches."
- "Serving immediately is essential. It'll help keep that crunch intact. If saving some later, wrap them carefully but expect sogginess eventually. Storage tips: maybe separate filling from bread."
faq:
- "q: How to make eggs firm but tender? a: Bake until edges are set. Careful not to dry out. Touch check for right texture while cooking."
- "q: What if zucchini isn't crisp? a: Adjust frying heat; too high burns, too low steams. One layer frying prevents mushiness."
- "q: How to avoid soggy sandwich? a: Use fresh bread and let layers dry a bit before assembly. Stack wisely - too much moisture from tomatoes can lead to failure."
- "q: Can I store leftovers? a: Yes, can refrigerate but expect loss in crunch. Cover tightly if possible. But better fresh. Reheat only if necessary, not recommended."
