ingredients:
- "1 small onion, finely chopped"
- "60 ml (1/4 cup) extra virgin olive oil"
- "3 cloves garlic, minced"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) tomato paste"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) garam masala"
- "1.5 ml (1/3 tsp) smoked paprika"
- "200 ml (3/4 cup plus 2 tbsp) vegetable broth"
- "1 medium yellow bell pepper, deseeded and sliced thin"
- "500 g (1.1 lb) cod or halibut, cut into large chunks"
- "Salt and black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Heat 40 ml of olive oil over medium heat in a saucepan. Add the chopped onion, season lightly with salt, and cook until they soften and turn translucent, about 7 to 8 minutes."
- "Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, garam masala, and smoked paprika. Cook while stirring for 3 minutes to toast the spices."
- "Pour in vegetable broth, scraping the bottom of the pan to loosen any bits. Bring to a simmer and keep it gentle for 4 minutes. Remove from heat and set sauce aside."
- "In a separate large non-stick skillet, warm remaining olive oil on high heat. Toss in the sliced bell pepper and sauté for 4 to 5 minutes until slightly tender with a little char. Add peppers to the sauce and mix."
- "Add a touch more oil if needed, then place fish chunks in the hot skillet without crowding. Season with salt and pepper. Sear each side until golden, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Fish should be firm and opaque."
- "Return fish to the saucepan with sauce and peppers. Stir carefully to coat fish with the spiced sauce. Heat gently for a minute or two to meld flavors. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if necessary."
- "Serve immediately over freshly steamed basmati rice or warmed flatbread."
introduction: "Fish chunks tossed in a punchy, warmly spiced sauce. No cream, no fuss. Onion and garlic soften first, building simple base flavors. Tomato paste thickens and brightens. Garam masala spices with deep aromatic notes; smoked paprika swaps usual cayenne for smoky depth. Sautéed bell pepper adds sweetness, color, texture contrast. Broth lightens the sauce, prevents sticking and adds subtle savoriness. Quick pan sear locks in moisture on fish. Final mingle in sauce for combined taste. Get rice ready before you start. No gluten, no dairy, no nuts, avoiding common allergens. Simple yet layered; a home kitchen curry twist."
ingredientsNote: "Onions add mild sweetness, cut fine for quick softening. Olive oil chosen for neutral flavor and suitable cooking point. Increase garlic for more pungency or reduce if desired. Tomato paste concentrates tomato flavor without making red sauce soupy. Garam masala lends essential Indian flavor, but blend brands vary – taste and adjust quantity accordingly. Smoked paprika replaces usual cayenne to reduce heat, add smoke – can swap with regular paprika or chili powder if preferred. Vegetable broth keeps things plant-based and lighter compared to chicken stock. Bell pepper julienned to ensure quick cooking and better texture contrast to fish. Firm white fish like cod or halibut holds shape better than flaky varieties. Salt and pepper essential; season early and adjust later."
instructionsNote: "Cooking onions low and slow first pulls out sweetness, softening texture. Garlic and spices added later prevent burning, unlocking aromas, should be stirred constantly. Deglazing with broth not just for moisture but to scrape up tasty fond bits from pan. Simmer sauce gently to meld flavors without breaking down tomato paste too much. High heat needed to sauté bell peppers quickly, preserving some bite and flavor. Fish should be dry before searing, cooked quickly on each side to prevent tough texture—don’t move too much to get nice sear. Combining fish with sauce off heat or low avoids overcooking delicate flesh. Taste-test seasoning near the end to correct salt, adjust spice as needed. Serve piping hot. Basmati makes perfect base – fragrant, light grains contrast sauce beautifully."
tips:
- "Chop onions small. This helps them soften fast. Sweetness comes out. Cook low heat at first. Allow time to get it right. Garlic later to avoid burning."
- "Use extra virgin olive oil when cooking. Good for flavor and high heat. Always check oil temperature for sautéing vegetables. Hot skillet is key."
- "Fish should be dry before searing. Pat it down with a paper towel. Helps achieve a good sear. Don’t crowd. Cook in batches if needed."
- "Taste as you go. Adjust salt and spices near end. Garam masala varies in strength between brands. Find the balance for your palate."
- "Serve quickly. Over basmati rice or flatbread. Both absorb sauce well. Keep warm while enjoying the dish for best texture and flavor."
