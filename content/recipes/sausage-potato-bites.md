ingredients:
- "2 cups all-purpose flour"
- "1 teaspoon baking soda"
- "½ teaspoon kosher salt"
- "½ cup melted ghee or clarified butter"
- "1 cup shredded sharp white cheddar cheese"
- "1 cup bulk cooked pork sausage, browned and drained"
- "2 cups frozen shredded hash browns, thawed and squeezed dry"
- "4 ounces softened Neufchatel cheese (or full-fat cream cheese)"
- "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard"
- "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary (replace parsley)"
- "maple syrup to serve"
instructions:
- "===Preheat & Prepare==="
- "Set oven to 405 degrees Fahrenheit; racks centered for even heat. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment or silicone mats. Avoid wax paper – it burns and sticks."
- "===Make Dough==="
- "Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in large bowl or mixer. Whisk briefly to aerate; ensures even rise."
- "While mixer runs on low, drizzle in ghee slowly. Stop once the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. The fat coats flour, limiting gluten development for tender bites."
- "Add grated cheddar, cooked sausage, drained hash browns, softened Neufchatel, and Dijon. Scrape sides with spatula mid-beating. Need full incorporation; dry patches will create lumps after baking."
- "===Form Bites==="
- "Use a tablespoon scoop or cookie scoop for consistent size. Scoop mixture, roll lightly in palms if they crumble, but don’t overwork — sticky and dense from cheese."
- "Place 1 inch apart on sheets; allow space for expanding edges to crisp up."
- "===Bake==="
- "Slide trays into oven. At 25 minutes, start auditory clues — listen for faint crackle as edges brown. Visual crackle on top; golden rims. Test doneness by pressing gently on a bite. Should hold shape but give slightly under pressure."
- "If less brown than expected, rotate pans and add 5 minutes. Excess browning means reducing time next batch."
- "===Serving==="
- "Remove from oven. Let sit 3 minutes; internal steam redistributes, firming centers. Drizzle warm maple syrup across. Sprinkle chopped fresh rosemary for piney brightness, replacing parsley."
- "Serve immediately. Cold bites lose crispness; reheat in oven at 350°F for 5 minutes if needed."
introduction: "Baked potato nuggets with sausage stuffing. Golden outside, tender inside. Crispy brown edges tell you they’re ready. The blend of creamy cheese and savory pork makes these addictive. Not a mess inside from raw dough. Instead, a crumbly base with binding cheese. Mix the fat with flour just right or risk tough bites. Don't skimp on the sausage – browned and drained to avoid sogginess. The hash browns have to be dry; squeezing frozen potatoes is crucial or they steam instead of bake. Maple syrup adds the sweet counterpoint — yes, give it a try. Rosemary in place of parsley declutters the herb scene with a sharp, aromatic note. Using Neufchatel softens the tang and keeps the mix moist but not runny. These come together quick but demand attention to texture at every step."
ingredientsNote: "Flour type matters for structure; all-purpose or pastry flour works best here. Baking soda replaces baking powder for milder rise but sharper browning. Swap ghee with melted coconut oil for subtle aroma, or use clarified butter if ghee isn't on hand. Neufchatel is a lower fat cream cheese; can replace with full-fat cream cheese or mascarpone, but take care to soften properly so it blends smoothly. If sausage raw, brown completely and drain off excess fat before mixing to prevent soggy bottoms. Frozen hash browns need full thaw and squeezing; any retained water produces steam, ruining crispness. Rosemary’s strong fragrance works well with pork but adjust amount to taste. Dijon mustard cuts cream's richness - not optional. Maple syrup adds balance, but honey or a splash of sweet chili sauce offers alternative sweetness or heat."
instructionsNote: "Start with dry mix to avoid clumping of raising agent. Adding melted fat gradually ensures fat coats flour instead of pooling - makes crumbly texture better. Overbeating after adding cheese and potatoes risks lumpiness and gummy bites - scrape the bowl thoroughly mid-mix to avoid patches of dry flour. Using a cookie scoop standardizes size and baking time; uneven bites cook unevenly. Rolling too much introduces heat and stickiness; handle minimally but enough to consolidate. Baking sheets lined with parchment or silicone prevent sticking; skip greasing which can fry bottoms and ruin crispness. Bake until tops crackle lightly and edges turn golden brown - these are key visual cues. Rely on touch; firm but not dense means perfect chew. Let cool a moment — bites finish setting with residual heat. Maple syrup shouldn't be too cold; warm slightly so it lightly melts into crevices without drowning crisp texture."
tips:
- "Key to crispness is dryness. Frozen hash browns need squeezing. Watch for steaming. Spread magic all over the bites. Little water means crispy edges."
- "Watch oven temp. 405°F is critical. Higher risks burning; lower may steam. Listen for that crackling sound as edges brown. Watch for golden color."
- "Don’t skip on sausage, browned and drained. Fat leads to sogginess. Skin it back to avoid a mess. Ensure crispness in every bite."
- "Neufchatel adds creaminess. Can swap it. Full-fat cream cheese or mascarpone works. Just ensure it’s soft. Blend easily and even. No lumps."
- "Roll lightly; don’t overwork dough. Sticky might crumble. Handles gentle but firm. Aim for cohesive bites. Cookie scoop ensures even sizes, crucial."
faq:
- "q: How to keep bites crispy? a: Store in cool place but not fridge. Reheat without steam - oven. Crisp tops should remain."
- "q: Substitutions for sausage? a: Use turkey or chicken sausage. Keep lean. Adds different flavor; adjust seasoning. Ensure fully cooked."
- "q: What if they fall apart? a: Mix too much? Careful with potatoes. Dryness is key. Less moisture means better structure. Try less mixing."
- "q: Can I freeze them? a: Yes, freeze pre-baked bites. Thaw first; bake again until golden. Quick and use them when ready. Versatile storage."
