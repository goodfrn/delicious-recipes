Crunchy gratinéed bread with Gruyère replaces cheddar for nuttier bite. Fresh herbs finish with a bright note. Adjust roasting time by visually checking for golden edges and softened flesh.

ingredients:
- "600 g parsnips peeled cut in cubes"
- "2 large onions cut in chunks"
- "4 cloves garlic unpeeled"
- "1 leek white part sliced 1.5 cm thickness"
- "1 tart Granny Smith apple cored cubed unpeeled"
- "50 ml good olive oil plus extra for finish"
- "1.2 liter hot vegetable broth"
- "2 slices country-style bread"
- "75 g Gruyère cheese grated"
- "25 ml fresh chives chopped"
instructions:
- "Set oven rack mid-level. Heat oven to 225 C. Use parchment-lined tray or well-oiled pan to prevent sticking."
- "Toss parsnips onions garlic leek and apple with olive oil. Season lightly with salt and cracked pepper. Spread evenly. Roast 40-50 minutes. Roast longer if vegetables not soft with browned edges. Garlic skins will shrivel and darken—remove skins and squeeze pulp by hand. Discard skins—avoid leaving whole cloves in soup to prevent bitter raw garlic notes."
- "Transfer veggies and garlic pulp to blender. Pour in hot broth. Blend until fully smooth and no fibrous bits remain. Taste test and adjust salt pepper if needed. Warm gently on stovetop if cold."
- "Place bread slices on same roasting pan. Distribute grated Gruyère cheese atop. Bake 4-6 minutes until cheese bubbles and melts golden brown but not burnt."
- "Cut cheesy bread into rustic cubes. Ladle soup into bowls. Drizzle olive oil on top for richness. Scatter bread cubes over soup. Sprinkle with fresh chives to add sharp freshness. Serve immediately."
introduction: "Roasting parsnips coax out a natural sweetness that you won’t get from boiling. They need to caramelize well—watch those edges, golden but not blackened. Onions join the party to add that deep, fragrant base. Don’t skimp on garlic; roasting softens it into a mellow creaminess, but keep the skins intact till the end or garlic bitterness sneaks in. Leek adds an oniony depth without harshness. Apple slices melt into the mix adding a tart counterpoint. The bonus winner—cheesy toasted bread with gooey Gruyère. Crunch, color, salt, and bite all in one."
ingredientsNote: "Boost your roasting flavor by using parsnips on the larger side—they retain moisture better than thinner ones. Swap Granny Smith for a Pink Lady if you like extra sweetness. Sometimes you want vegetable broth instead of chicken for a lighter background; just make sure it’s hot when blending to avoid cooling the soup down and dulling flavors. Gruyère is a solid replacement for cheddar. It melts beautifully and adds nuttiness without overpowering. Use day-old crusty bread for toasts so they hold up to the liquid and won’t turn mushy immediately. Olive oil quality matters here. Use extra virgin for drizzling to get peppery aromatics that bloom fresh on the finish. Leek should be white and pale green only—green tougher parts can introduce bitterness or stringiness."
instructionsNote: "Forget precise minutes. Roast vegetables patiently, check for golden edges and tender interiors using a fork—if nothing resists, they’re done. Roast garlic with skin to bag mellow flavors. Squeeze pulp with fingers, no knife to keep it soft. Purée with hot broth—cold liquid dulls flavor and makes texture gluey. Cheesy bread must be toasted directly on the pan to crisp the crust, not just melt cheese in a microwave or toaster oven. Cut into chunks only after baking to retain crispiness. Always finish with fresh herbs—ciboulette or chives, they add sharpness and color contrast. Olive oil drizzle is finishing touch—adds sheen and silkiness. Serving immediately keeps bread crunchy—no sogginess from delaying."
tips:
- "Roasting enhances flavors. Check those edges—golden brown is key. Keep an eye on garlic—perfect balance between mellow and bitter—don't let them burn. Bigger parsnips, more moisture. If using broth, heat it first—cold liquid dulls soup."
- "Crusty bread is must for texture. Day-old bread works better— fresher gets mushy fast in soup. Gruyère is versatile—mellows that sharpness in cheddar. Want more kick? Try adding a pinch of chili flakes after blending."
- "Vegetable broth instead of chicken broth gives lighter taste. But needs to be hot—cold dulls flavors, like stale bread—nothing worse. Over-roasting? Check for doneness with a fork—smooth but firm is what you want."
- "Chives are nice but fresh herbs can vary—the bolder, the better. Forget cutting bread before baking—toasting keeps it crunchy. Need more acidity? A squeeze of lemon just before serving is fab. Remember, keep the soup warm while serving."
- "Last thought—cleanup can be messy. Parchment paper aids in easy removal from pan— a big time-saver. Always taste before serving. Adjust seasoning if it falls flat—don't hesitate, flavors need to dance."
faq:
- "q: How long can I store the soup? a: Up to 3 days in fridge. Cool first. Reheat gently—watch texture. If too thick, add broth. Freezing is okay—best within a month. Mix before serving, stir well."
- "q: What if the soup is too thick? a: Just add hot broth until desired thickness. Blend well—keep it even. No lumps. If too watery, simmer to thicken, not overcook or lose flavor. Adjust salt to balance."
- "q: Can I make it vegan? a: Absolutely. Use vegetable broth, skip cheese or try vegan options. For creamy texture, add more apples or lentils. Things like coconut milk can work too—a different twist on flavor."
- "q: What if I don't have parsnips? a: Carrots can substitute. Adds sweetness too. Same cooking time basically, but keep checking for doneness. Rutabaga works as well—different taste, same method. Seasonal vegetable swaps often work."
