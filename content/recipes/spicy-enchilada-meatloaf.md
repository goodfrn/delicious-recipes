description: "Ground beef meets crushed tortilla chips and green chilies, packed with earthy cheddar cheese hidden inside. Sauced with a zesty blend of enchilada sauce and smoky chipotle ketchup. Oven roasted till firm with a browned crust. A cross between Mexican comfort and classic meatloaf, with a gooey cheese core. Use beef or sub with turkey or pork if desired. Crushed chips add crunch and bulk while absorbing moisture. Skip fresh garlic if pressed; garlic powder works but won’t bloom the same. Keep cheese block sealed tightly in the meat to prevent leaks while baking. Rest to let juices settle before slicing."

ingredients:
- "1 1/2 pounds ground beef chuck"
- "3/4 cup crushed tortilla chips, finely chopped"
- "3/4 cup green enchilada sauce, divided"
- "1/3 cup diced white onion"
- "2 cloves garlic, minced"
- "4 ounces canned diced green chilies, drained"
- "1 large egg"
- "1 tablespoon taco seasoning mix"
- "5 ounces block sharp cheddar cheese"
- "1/4 cup smoky chipotle ketchup"
instructions:
- "Set oven to 355F. Spray a 9x13 casserole dish with oil mist. No sticky mess later."
- "Chop tortilla chips down to about half a cup. Use food processor pulse or a rolling pin in a zip top. Toss half the enchilada sauce with the chips till soaked and soupy-ish. Set aside."
- "In the food processor, blitz onion, garlic, and green chilies until fine but not puree. You want texture left."
- "Combine chopped veggies with the enriched chips mixture. Stir till evenly combined. Smell the garlic and onion aroma lifting."
- "In a large bowl, mix ground beef, chip-veggie blend, egg, and taco seasoning. Use hands for best control, don't overwork or dense meatloaf. Split mixture roughly into thirds visually."
- "Press one third of the meat into the baking pan making a flat base, just enough to cover bottom center."
- "Nestle block of cheddar in center. Press slightly to embed but don’t crush cheese. Maintain a cavity."
- "Layer rest of meat mixture over cheese, cover completely and press edges closed firmly. Seal well to trap melting cheese inside; leaks mean lost flavor and mess."
- "Whisk remaining enchilada sauce with chipotle ketchup by hand. Pour evenly over the top to glaze the loaf."
- "Slide into oven. Bake about 65 minutes. Watch for browned edges, firm crust, juices bubbling at edges. Internal temp at 160F means safe beef done."
- "Rest at least 5 minutes before slicing. Cheese inside will be molten but contained, loaf will firm up for clean cuts."
introduction: "Ground beef tossed with crushed tortilla chips soaked in bold enchilada sauce. Not your Grandma’s meatloaf but the slow roast of familiar tex-mex flavors within the classic form. Garlic and onions finely minced with green chilies bring heat layered deep. Inside, a sharp cheddar block waits to melt, sealed tight in a beefy fortress. The surface glistens with a smoky chipotle ketchup blend, roasting to a lively glaze that crackles softly in the oven. Crunch from the chips holds moisture making the crumb tight but tender. Resting is key. Let it sit, juices settle, flavors marry for slicing that shows clean layers and molten cheese ooze in the center. Chatty kitchen tales aside, this one is about texture and boundaries — hold all components tightly. Don’t skimp on seal or sauce."
ingredientsNote: "Use ground chuck for fat content and flavor. Too lean and meatloaf dries out rapidly. If unavailable, ground turkey or pork shoulder are fine, adjust cook time accordingly. Tortilla chips give crunch, absorb sauce, and add corn flavor. If chips aren’t handy, crushed cornflakes or crushed stale tortillas are decent substitutes; avoid bread crumbs here — texture differs. Green chilies add heat but keep it subtle; swap with pickled jalapeños for more punch but reduce quantity. Cheddar block offers gooey melt that slices clean. Shredded cheese won’t work the same for this style. Taco seasoning can be pre-made or from scratch; key spices are cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, and oregano. The chipotle ketchup glaze introduces smoky tang — you can swap ketchup for tomato paste mixed with smoked paprika if ketchup sweetness isn’t wanted."
instructionsNote: "Chopping the onion, garlic, and chilies fine but not pureed lets pockets of flavor emerge while blending evenly into the meat. Mixing ground beef by hand is the best way; overmixing leads to dense, tough meatloaf. The tortilla chips soaked in sauce function as a binder and moisture retainer — doing this separately before adding to beef avoids dry patches. Forming the meatloaf with cheese inside requires sealing edges well: pinch and press for no gaps, else cheese leaks and burns on pan. The sauce glaze on top keeps it moist in oven and caramelizes slightly — uneven glazing means uneven crust. Watch both for internal temperature using a probe at thickest point and visual cues like browned edges and bubbling juices on sides. Rest before slicing minimizes crumbiness and cheese loss. Use a serrated knife or a wet sharp chef’s knife for clean slices."
tips:
- "Chop those tortilla chips finely. Don't just toss 'em in whole. They soak up sauce but too big means soggy spots. Use food processor or rolling pin. Crush till they barely resemble chips. Bind texture without losing crunch."
- "Eggs help bind, sure, but don’t overwork beef. Use hands, feel the mix. Press gently but seal edges tight. Air gaps lead to leaks. Focus on keeping cheese in; melted mess in oven's no good."
- "Want a flavor boost? Toss in fresh herbs or spices. Extras can jazz the dish up. But keep tomatoes or other wet ingredients down; moisture too high means mush. Use dry ingredients wisely to elevate."
- "Glaze matters. Whisk ketchup and enchilada sauce till smooth. Pour evenly, cover without pools for consistent crust. Uneven sauce leads to uneven baking. Look for bubbling edges, firm center for doneness."
- "Resting can’t be skipped. Let loaf set post-bake. Cuts cleaner, less aggressive cheese ooze. Flavors come together from resting. Cut too soon and juices spill; can ruin it. A messy slice means missed opportunity."
faq:
- "q: Can I swap ingredients? a: Absolutely, turkey or pork fits. Adjust bake time. Green chilies can be swapped with jalapeños but reduce to counter heat. Avoid bread crumbs; use crushed cornflakes if chips aren’t around."
- "q: Storing leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. Keeps for 3 to 4 days. Can also freeze after cooling. Wrap tightly or place in freezer bag. Keep sauce aside for extra moisture while reheating."
- "q: How do I reheat? a: Oven is best. Warm at low temp till it’s heated through. Microwaving? Use a damp paper towel, reduces dryness. Avoid high power; can make it tough."
- "q: Why does it lose moisture? a: Cooking too hot; check oven temp. Sealing edges tight minimizes leaks during baking. Chips absorb some moisture but not too much, so keep a balance."
