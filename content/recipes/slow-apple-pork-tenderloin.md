title: "Slow Apple Pork Tenderloin"
slug: "slow-apple-pork-tenderloin"
description: "Pork tenderloin nestled in a bed of sliced apples and onions cooks low and slow. Cumin, cinnamon, garlic powder, and mustard ground together with maple syrup form a spiced sticky paste. Apple wedges tucked into pork slits release sweet, tart steam inside the meat. Cook until tender, fragrant, and juices run clear. Sub two pears for apples, or swap honey with maple syrup for earthier sweetness. Low water content apples absorb, soften evenly, and caramelize lightly against pork’s richness. Onions add savory depth. Serve with rustic sides. No fuss with peeling apples if you mind a bite of texture. This method retools simple ingredients into soulful, saucy comfort, coaxing out every note of fall flavors."

ingredients:
- "3 to 4 medium apples sliced ½ inch thick"
- "2 medium onions cut in ½ inch rings"
- "1 1/2 to 2 pound pork tenderloin"
- "1 teaspoon ground cumin"
- "¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon"
- "½ teaspoon garlic powder"
- "1 teaspoon dry mustard powder"
- "3 tablespoons maple syrup"
- "Salt and pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Peel apples optional. Slice 3 apples and onions into half-inch thick rounds. Save half of one apple sliced for stuffing inside pork."
- "Using a sharp knife, score ¾-inch spaced slits across pork tenderloin top about halfway down - careful, not too deep or you dry out meat."
- "Season pork lightly with salt and pepper. Arrange onions and most apple slices on crockpot base."
- "Nestle pork into apple-onion bed. Tuck reserved apple slices into each slit of the pork. They’ll steam inside, infusing subtle sweetness."
- "Combine cumin, cinnamon, garlic powder, mustard powder, and maple syrup into a thick paste. Spread all over tenderloin top acting as a glaze and spice crust."
- "Cover crockpot. Cook low for 7 hours or until pork registers 145 degrees and juices run clear. High for 3-3½ hours if pressed but risk drier edges."
- "Look for meat pulling away slightly from edges, the glaze caramelized but no black spots. Apples should be soft but hold shape, onions translucent and sweet. Smells deep and warm."
- "Let rest 5 minutes before slicing to lock juices. Spoon cooked apples and onions as topping or side."
introduction: "Not fussing with complicated steps. Slice apples and onions thick enough to stay intact but thin enough for steam to move through. Scoring tenderloin lets sweetness seep deep into pork — no dry boring center here. Spices ground fresh instead of a pre-mixed rub build layers slowly. Honey swapped out for more robust maple — sticky and earthy— adds complexity. Slow cook for hours, but sensory cues matter more: sizzle stops, aroma deepens, glaze changes to a warm mahogany. Apples soften, soak flavors. Onions become pliable and sweet counterpoint. Feed six from one pan, no fancy tools. Keep an eye on juices; they signal perfect doneness better than times. Slow cooker does the heavy lifting; you get the credit. Apple and pork, time-tested partners, with a little twist and a commonsense approach."
ingredientsNote: "Apples: go for tart to balance richness. Granny Smith or Braeburn hold shape, stay firm. Swap pears for milder sweetness, but they cook faster—cut thinner or add later. Onions bring savory counter; white or yellow best. Red will tint juices but less sweet. Pork tenderloin is lean; don’t overcook or dryness sets. Maple syrup backs off on the overly floral if honey is off-hand. Dry mustard powder adds sharpness, necessary to cut sweetness. Spice substitutes like ground coriander or nutmeg possible but change profile. Fresh spices ground crush better but pantry staples suffice. Salt helps draw moisture, enhances flavors; don't skip."
instructionsNote: "Good knife skills save time and frustration—slits evenly spaced let apple release juices inside but not collapse meat. Don't slice too deep; risk drying or bouquet loss. Apple and onion base stops pork from sticking and lifts it in flavorful steam. The spice paste seals in juices, builds a crust that glazes nicely against slow heat. Watch the crockpot aroma—when spicy-sweet fills kitchen, you're almost there. Don’t rely solely on time; poke pork to check firmness and juices. If juices run colored or smell off, cook longer. Rest after cooking for tighter juices; slicing too early leaks them out. If glaze sticks excessively, tent with foil to prevent burning in last hour. Leftover pork slices great cold with mustard or warmed gently with pan drippings."
tips:
- "Choose tart apples. Granny Smith or Braeburn hold structure. A firm apple absorbs flavors but doesn’t collapse. If pears used, consider cutting thinner for even cooking."
- "Score pork lightly. ¾-inch slits, not too deep. Go shallow for juicy results. Helps sweetness seep in. Too deep risks drying out meat."
- "Maple syrup adds depth but consider honey too. Different sweetness profiles change flavor dynamics. Explore spice swaps. Ground coriander for variation."
- "Check doneness via juices, not just time. Color matters; clear juices signal readiness. Feel the tenderness. If juices run red, keep cooking. Adjust time as needed."
- "Rest meat after cooking. Five minutes locks juices inside. Slicing too soon loses flavor and moisture. Spoon cooked apples and onions over pork for serving."
faq:
- "q: Can I cook on high? a: Sure but risk drier edges. High cooks 3-3½ hours. Best low for full flavor. Juices run clear indicate doneness."
- "q: What if I don’t have a slow cooker? a: Oven on low works too, but need to check often. Temperature key; keep it low, maintain moisture with foil."
- "q: Storage suggestions? a: Leftover pork keeps well in fridge for 3-4 days. Reheat gently in pan with drippings for moisture. Freeze for longer life."
- "q: What spices can I swap? a: Ground nutmeg or coriander. Each alters profile. Fresh spices work best. Always adjust quantities, stronger flavors vary."
