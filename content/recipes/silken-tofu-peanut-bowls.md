ingredients:
- "=== Vinaigrette ==="
- "35 g roasted unsalted peanuts, finely chopped"
- "1 peeled garlic clove, finely grated"
- "60 ml reduced sodium soy sauce"
- "25 ml vegetable oil"
- "15 ml brown sugar"
- "12 ml rice vinegar"
- "2.5 ml crushed red chili flakes"
- ""
- "=== Salad ==="
- "90 g rice vermicelli noodles"
- "150 g curly leaf lettuce, torn"
- "5 Lebanese cucumbers, halved lengthwise then cut into angled pieces"
- "1 ripe but firm avocado, sliced thin"
- "300 g silken tofu, well drained and torn"
- "2 green onions, thinly sliced"
instructions:
- "=== Vinaigrette ==="
- "Whisk peanuts, garlic, soy sauce, oil, sugar, vinegar, chili flakes in a bowl until sugar dissolves. Taste for balance; add more sugar or vinegar if needed. Set aside; flavors meld better after resting."
- ""
- "=== Salad ==="
- "Bring salted water to a rolling boil. Drop vermicelli in, stir gently. Remove from heat after 2 minutes; noodles should be tender but resilient, not mushy. Drain immediately, rinse under cold water to stop cooking and remove starch. Shake well to drain. Cut noodles into thirds for bite-sized portions."
- ""
- "Place lettuce, cucumber chunks, and avocado slices on plates in loose, overlapping piles. Scatter torn tofu over veggies in generous handfuls; moisture from tofu softens ingredients beneath."
- ""
- "Drizzle vinaigrette evenly over bowls, ensuring dressing wets noodles and tofu first to lock in flavor. Sprinkle sliced green onions on top for sharpness and color contrast."
- ""
- "Serve with chili crisp condiment on the side if more heat or texture desired."

- "Substitutions: Swap peanuts with almonds or replace soy sauce with tamari for gluten-free. Oil can be toasted sesame for richness or sunflower for neutrality. If tofu too soft, press briefly in kitchen towel to remove excess water before tearing; prevents watery dish."
- "Common trap: overcooking vermicelli. Watch carefully, they carry residual heat and soften fast. Rinsing cold stops cooking instantly and keeps noodles springy."
- "Adding avocado last avoids browning and pile presentation looks better fresh."
- "Dressing needs balance; warm oil dissolves sugar better, but don’t overheat or garlic tastes bitter."
introduction: "Crunch cracks from peanuts, pungent garlic slivers in the dressing, bright crunch from cucumber meets silk from tofu. Vermicelli barely cooked, tender but with chew and bounce that pleases the teeth. Green onion sharpens and lifts the dense cream of avocado slices, adding dimension. Timing and texture matter here; overcooked vermicelli turns mushy and dull. Dressing is the jumpstart, sticky sweet meets spice; garlic minced fine enough to seep flavor but not overwhelm. This bowl plays the fine balance of proteins, fat, and acid—a quiet battle in each bite. Needed: a light hand, precise watch on noodles, and a sharp knife for trimming cucumber. The tofu, torn not sliced to increase surface and soak up dressing. No surprise hero in this salad; everything shares the stage equally. Using any leftover peanut oil or swapping in another nut butter base shifts the dish toward your pantry's tone. It's about control, finesse, and knowing when to stop."
ingredientsNote: "Peanuts here bring crunch and roast flavor; swapping for almonds okay but texture changes. The soy sauce reduced sodium to keep the salt in check—too much throws dish off. Garlic is grated, not chopped—fine particles release more aromatic oils. Rice vinegar adds softness; sharp apple cider vinegar can overpower. Oil—standard veggie or toasted sesame—depends on desired flavor weight. Vermicelli rinsed cold stops starch making noodles gluey; critical to proper mouthfeel. Avocado benefits from firm ripeness; mushy will turn sludgy in salad. Tofu silken provides gentle creaminess but drains well to avoid soupy salad. Cucumbers cut on bias for a better mouthfeel, more bite surface area exposed. Green onions sliced thin, aromatic but not invasive."
instructionsNote: "Precision in timing is key; vermicelli waits only 2 to 3 minutes off heat—overdone noodles lose bounce, turn gummy. Rinse immediately to preserve texture and cool in quick shock. Dress noodles and tofu first; liquids cling better and flavor sinks in. Tear tofu gently to increase surface area absorbing dressing without breaking down too much. Toss lettuce and crunchy veggies separately to keep them fresh and crisp, then combine just before serving. Use your nose: garlic should scent the dressing softly, not sharp and burned—if heated too much, reduce heat next time. Let vinaigrette rest for 5 minutes; helps balance sweet and spice. Slice green onions just before plating; they wilt quickly. Chili crisp is optional fire; adds crunch and heat but watch how much—the dressing already carries subtle spice."
tips:
- "Noodles are key; watch the boiling. Just 2 minutes off heat, rinse in cold. Stops cooking immediately. Keeps noodles chewy. Essential."
- "Garlic needs to be grated not chopped fine particles release oils better. No burning; avoid bitter taste. Mix into vinaigrette quick."
- "Balance your dressing; sugar and vinegar need harmony. Taste as you go. Adjust; it’s all about the flavor levels here. Warm oil helps dissolve."
- "Freshness counts. Toss lettuce and cucumbers separately; they wilt fast. Combine just before serving. Keeps crunch intact. Visual appeal matters."
- "Peanuts bring crunch. If using almonds, texture changes. Sunflower seeds valid for nut allergies. Adjust for personal preferences. It’s flexible."
faq:
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Keep refrigerated for up to two days. Noodles could get mushy. Store items separately if possible. Adds longevity."
- "q: What if the tofu is too soft? a: Briefly press with a kitchen towel; removes excess water. Helps maintain structure when tearing. Better texture."
- "q: I don’t have rice vinegar, alternatives? a: Apple cider vinegar works but sharper taste. Keep in mind; flavors shift. Adjust other ingredients accordingly."
- "q: How to stop noodles from getting gluey? a: Cold rinse immediately after cooking. Gelatinization happens fast; crucial to stop cooking. Keep them bouncy."
