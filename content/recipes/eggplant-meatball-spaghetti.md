ingredients:
- "=== Eggplant Meatballs ==="
- "1 medium eggplant about 450 g (around 1 lb), peeled, cut into cubes"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) olive oil"
- "20 g (3 tbsp) panko breadcrumbs or crushed crackers"
- "20 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) ground flaxseeds or milled chia seeds"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste"
- "=== Tomato Sauce ==="
- "4 garlic cloves, minced"
- "1 dried bay leaf"
- "1/2 ml (1/8 tsp) crushed red pepper flakes"
- "1 can 700 ml (24 oz) crushed San Marzano tomatoes or homemade canned plum tomatoes"
- "300 g (2/3 lb) spaghetti"
- "Fresh basil leaves, optional for garnish"
- "Nutritional yeast or vegan parmesan substitute to taste, optional"
instructions:
- "=== Eggplant Meatballs ==="
- "Preheat oven to 215°C (420°F). Line baking sheet with parchment or silicone mat."
- "Toss eggplant cubes in oil, salt, pepper directly on sheet. Spread in single layer, no crowding. Roast until skin edges brown and flesh soft, 18 to 22 minutes. Flip halfway. Look for shriveled edges and slightly caramelized bits."
- "Cool enough to handle. Mash roughly with potato masher or fork. Leave some chunks for texture."
- "Mix in breadcrumbs and ground flaxseeds for binder. Season again if needed. If mixture very wet, add a few more crumbs; dry, splash few drops water."
- "With well-oiled hands, shape into 12 small balls using about 1 tbsp scoop each. Set back on sheet spaced apart. Roast 8 to 12 minutes turning once halfway. Should firm but not dry; fragile means less cooking needed next time."
- "=== Tomato Sauce ==="
- "Meanwhile, in heavy skillet over medium-high heat, warm 15 ml olive oil. Add garlic, bay leaf, and red pepper flakes. Stir until garlic just golden, releasing punchy aroma but not burnt. About 2 to 3 minutes. Watch closely."
- "Pour in crushed tomatoes. Reduce heat to low. Let simmer uncovered. Stir occasionally. Sauce thickens and bubbles gently, darkening in color. 18 to 22 minutes."
- "Season with salt and pepper. Remove bay leaf. Taste. If too acidic, pinch sugar or a splash balsamic vinegar helps balance."
- "=== Pasta and Assembly ==="
- "In large pot, bring heavily salted water to rolling boil. Add spaghetti, stir occasionally to avoid sticking."
- "Cook until just shy of al dente (strain a strand, bite, slight resistance). Usually 8 to 10 minutes depending on pasta brand and altitude."
- "Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water before draining."
- "Drain pasta well. Optionally toss with a drizzle olive oil to prevent clumping."
- "Gently fold the eggplant balls into hot sauce. Simmer together another 4 to 6 minutes on low. Avoid stirring too hard to keep shape intact."
- "If sauce feels thick, add reserved pasta water teaspoon by teaspoon to loosen."
- "Serve pasta in deep bowls, spoon over meatballs and tomato sauce. Sprinkle with fresh basil and vegan parmesan if using."
- "Eat immediately. Sauce sticky and vibrant. Meatballs tender yet cohesive."
introduction: "Forget boring pasta nights. You want hearty, vegan, real textures, right? Eggplant roasted until it's collapsing but holds some bite. Mixed with ground flax or chia for that gel-like binding without eggs. Breadcrumbs for crunch and structure. No tofu or processed fillers. Sauce simmering low so garlic breathes out flavor, heat from red flakes just whispers. Bay leaf for depth. Cooking pasta just before serving, always salty water, always tasting pasta along the way. That brief moment when the strands still snap but yield pleasurably. Toss, reheating meatballs gently, keeping them snug in sauce so they never dry out. Basil was that last garden hit, vegan parm optional but recommended if you like that cheesy umami kick."
ingredientsNote: "Eggplant size matters. Smaller means denser, larger can be watery—adjust crumbs accordingly. If no breadcrumbs, crushed rice crackers or oats work but watch texture. Flaxseed is a handy swap for chia; both gel but flax is earthier. Roasting temperature is key; too low and eggplant stews, too high and it chars—watch carefully for puffing and browning skin. Tomatoes canned aren’t all equal—pull the best quality you can. Add sugar or vinegar sparingly to tame acidity, taste often. The garlic should smell nutty golden, never bitter burnt. Bay leaf can be omitted but contributes subtle depth baked to soup, don’t overboil it. Pasta brands vary; adjust salt and cook times accordingly."
instructionsNote: "Roasting eggplant is the cornerstone; you want it tender, a little wrinkled, not soggy. Stirring too often in sauce breaks down solids, loses texture. Let sauce bubble gently—sound changes when it reduces, getting quieter, breaks forming on surface. Use oil to keep meatball shaping easy; sticky hands frustrate. When adding meatballs back into sauce, low heat is your friend—stirring roughly breaks them. Salt pasta water heavily—that's your baseline seasoning. Don't rinse cooked pasta; you’ll wash away that necessary surface starch. Reserve pasta water to adjust sauce consistency; helps coat pasta. Let resting sauce and pasta mingle briefly before plating. Basil leaves torn for aroma, vegan parm sprinkled last for texture contrast."
tips:
- "Watch eggplant roast. Tender, slightly wrinkled skin signals readiness. No soggy. Perfect balance is key. Adjust crumbs if too wet. Consider rising steam. Flavor comes alive."
- "Tomato sauce needs slow simmer. Golden garlic aroma is your cue. Stir occasionally, don’t break meatballs. Taste for acidity; a pinch of sugar works wonders. More depth?"
- "Cook pasta less than usual. Al dente means no mush. Reserve pasta water; its starch helps sauce. If too thick, add back bit by bit. Control texture, don’t rush."
- "Breadcrumb substitutes matter. Crushed rice crackers work but watch for dryness. Oats can bind too. Adjust based on eggplant texture. Size impacts moisture levels."
- "Keep cooking oil handy. Meaty eggplant balls need shaping. Oil on hands prevents sticking. Avoid fragile meatballs; check internal firmness. Flip carefully while roasting."
faq:
- "q: How long to roast eggplant? a: Check after 18 minutes; skin should brown, flesh soft. No need to rush. Flip at halfway point to even it out, watch carefully."
- "q: Alternatives for breadcrumbs? a: Crushed oats or rice crackers can substitute. Adjust moisture content. Not too dry or wet. Think texture when mixing."
- "q: What if sauce is too thin? a: Add more simmering time; let it bubble. If still thin, keep cooking gently. Reserve pasta water for extra help in thickening."
- "q: Storage advice? a: Keep cooked meatballs, sauce separately. Refrigerate in airtight containers. Lasts few days. Reheat gently to keep texture intact. Avoid microwave if possible."
