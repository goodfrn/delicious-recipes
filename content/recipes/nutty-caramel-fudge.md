ingredients:
- "1 can 280 ml sweetened condensed milk (brand Eagle recommended)"
- "400 g bittersweet chocolate, chopped roughly"
- "150 ml walnuts, toasted and chopped"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "½ tsp flaky sea salt"
instructions:
- "Line a 20 cm square pan with parchment paper, edges hanging for easy removal."
- "Heat the condensed milk in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally until warm, about 6 minutes; don’t boil."
- "Remove from heat and stir in chopped bittersweet chocolate until fully melted."
- "Add vanilla extract and mix briefly."
- "Pour mixture into a mixing bowl; cool for 7 minutes to reach tepid temperature."
- "Using an electric mixer, beat the fudge base for about 4 minutes until noticeably thickened and glossy."
- "Fold in toasted walnut pieces and the flaky sea salt with a spatula; mix gently but thoroughly."
- "Transfer fudge to lined pan; smooth surface with spatula."
- "Let stand at room temperature for 10 minutes to firm slightly."
- "Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or until firm to the touch."
- "Lift fudge out using parchment edges; cut into 15 squares with a sharp knife."
- "Store fudge in an airtight container at room temperature away from direct sun or heat."
introduction: "Sweet, rich, buttery bites with a twist of salt and vanilla. Nuts add crunch, chocolate melts smooth. Quick melt, some whipping, set cold. No fuss, no eggs, no gluten. The type of item that vanishes quickly — kid-friendly too. Handful of pantry items, quick to pull together. Fudge not too hard, not too soft. Clean lines cut. Good for nibbling or tucking in lunchboxes or gift boxes. Chill necessary, but not forever. Makes about 15 small squares, easy to scale up if needed."
ingredientsNote: "Adjustment: reduced condensed milk slightly to tighten texture; swapped semi-sweet chocolate for bittersweet to cut sugar. Added vanilla extract and flaky sea salt for balancing flavor and complexity. Walnuts provide crunch and nuttiness, roasted for deeper flavor profile. Measured in metric and imperial for convenience. No eggs or gluten ingredients; safe for many dietary needs. Condensed milk is key — brand can affect creaminess. Toast walnuts before chopping to enhance aroma and crunch. Keep salt minimal — just a scatter on top or mixed in for contrast."
instructionsNote: "Heating condensed milk gently, not boiling, is crucial to prevent scorching. Mixing in chocolate off heat avoids graininess. Cooling mixture a bit before whipping lets fudge thicken properly; whipping aerates and gives texture. Fold nuts carefully — avoid breaking them down too much. Lining the pan with parchment eases removal, sharp knife cuts firm but soft fudge cleanly. Let fudge sit at room temp first to prevent condensation formation when putting in fridge. Chill time can be adjusted slightly but avoid rushing so fudge sets evenly. Storing at room temp fine if consumed within a few days; refrigerate longer. Makes easy, no-stress batch."
tips:
- "Use quality bittersweet chocolate. Brands matter here. Different ones can change the taste. Melt properly, avoid boiling. This keeps the smoothness."
- "Parchment lining is crucial for clean removal. Overhang helps. Cut the fudge when chilled. Prevents sticking. A sharp knife is needed for clean cuts."
- "Chill properly. Don't rush. Let it sit out first. Helps prevent condensation in the fridge. Firmness is important. Not too hard, not too soft."
- "Whipping air into the fudge is key. Beats for thickness. Don't overmix the walnuts. Want some texture. Fold gently to keep the crunch."
- "Storage matters. Keep in an airtight container. Room temp is fine for a few days. Refrigerate for longer life. Avoid heat exposure. Direct sun bad."
faq:
- "q: How can I fix a too soft fudge? a: Refrigerate longer. Slow cool can help too. If too soft after that, maybe more chocolate next round."
- "q: What are alternatives for walnuts? a: Almonds work fine. Pecans too. Try different nuts really. Different flavors can come out this way."
- "q: Can I double the recipe? a: Yes, easily done. Adjust time for melting and chilling though. Make sure space is there, a bigger pan helpful."
- "q: How long does it last? a: At room temp, a few days safe. If cold stored, can last up to two weeks. Watch for spoilage cues though."
