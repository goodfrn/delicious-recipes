slug: "hearty-braised-beef-stew"
description: "Chunks of beef dusted with seasoned flour then seared until a deep crust forms, locking in flavor. Vegetables sautéed until they start to caramelize, adding layers without boiling out sweetness. Braised slowly in beef broth infused with tomato paste, fresh rosemary, and bay leaf for herbaceous depth. Potatoes added midway to soften into tender bites. Peas stirred in last, keeping their snap and bright green edge. Thickened with cornstarch slurry to just cling, not glue. Rich, savory, with bold aromatics. A stew built on texture contrasts, robust beef flavor, and kitchen-tested steps that avoid mushy veggies or bland broth. Perfect for long, slow cooking and hungry gatherings."

ingredients:
- "3 pounds beef chuck cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes"
- "1/3 cup all-purpose flour"
- "1 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"
- "1 teaspoon smoked paprika"
- "3 tablespoons unsalted butter"
- "2 tablespoons grapeseed oil (substitute for olive oil)"
- "1 large yellow onion chopped"
- "3 garlic cloves minced"
- "2 large carrots cut into 1/2 inch rounds"
- "2 celery stalks sliced"
- "1 1/2 cups beef stock (replace 1/2 cup with red wine for depth)"
- "2 tablespoons tomato paste"
- "3 medium Yukon gold potatoes peeled and diced"
- "1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce"
- "1 bay leaf"
- "1 1/2 teaspoons dried rosemary or 1 tablespoon fresh chopped"
- "1 cup frozen green beans (instead of peas)"
- "1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons cold water"
- "Salt and pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Coat surface with flour seasoned by salt, pepper, and paprika. Toss beef cubes until lightly coated. Shake off excess to avoid clumps that burn."
- "Heat butter and grapeseed oil in large heavy-bottom pot over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add beef in batches so crowds avoid steaming. Brown cubes on all sides, about 4 minutes per batch. Listen for steady sizzle without smoke. Transfer browned beef to plate, don’t crowd pan or wet meat."
- "If pan looks dry, add a bit more butter or oil. Reduce heat to medium. Toss in garlic, onion, carrots, and celery. Stir occasionally. Watch veg soften and edges start to turn light amber, roughly 6 to 8 minutes. You want sweetness, not raw."
- "Stir in tomato paste, cook 2 minutes until it darkens slightly and tastes less sharp. Pour in beef stock and red wine. Scrape browned bits off pan bottom—they carry all the flavor. Add potatoes, Worcestershire sauce, bay leaf, and rosemary. Nestle beef pieces back in."
- "Bring pot to a lively boil; bubbles should break surface consistently. Cover, then reduce heat to low so it barely simmers. No vigorous bubbles or stew will toughen. Cook until beef feels tender when pierced with fork, roughly 1 hour 30 minutes though texture here trumps clock."
- "Mix cornstarch and water, then slowly drizzle into stew while stirring. This thickens juices, turning thin broth to clingy sauce. Leave lid off now, continue stirring occasionally to prevent lumps. After 10 to 15 minutes, the stew should coat a spoon thickly."
- "Remove bay leaf. Toss in the frozen green beans last 5 to 8 minutes to keep their snap. Overcooking beans turns them mushy and dulls color. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper now."
- "Rest a few minutes before serving to meld flavors further and let sauce settle."
introduction: "Brown meat pieces until crust forms; that crust matter. That’s what builds stew’s backbone, not some late addition glue. Flour seasoned firm up that crust, paprika adds subtle smoky warmth, black pepper sharpens. And watch the oil—they fry, not steam meat. Too crowded and steam wins, you end with boiled beef chunks. Veggies first sautéed till edges turn amber, releasing sugars—the aroma shifts, smells like kitchen fire and sweetness marrying. Tomato paste needs a patina before adding liquid, darkens, flavors deepen. Broth and wine hit the pot, scrape up every last stuck bit, don’t let that flavor die in the pan. Low steady simmer crushes time over heat here, tenderizing beef without shredding it into forgettable mush. Rushing this phase ruins texture. Cornstarch slurry or arrowroot makes sauce cling without starch glue mistakes. Frozen green beans swapped for peas to keep crunch and color, added late not too early—rules of greens in thick sauces. A stew for those who want more than just meat and mush."
ingredientsNote: "Flour seasoned with paprika and pepper forms a simple but effective coating; don’t skip this step or risk bland meat. Grapeseed oil withstands heat better than olive, keep butter for flavor. Beef chuck with ample marbling breaks down into tender bites but avoid cheap cuts that turn stringy. Tomato paste here isn’t just tang, it lifts umami. Red wine swapped in for part broth adds complexity but not a showstopper if skipped. Yukon gold potatoes hold shape better than russet and absorb flavors instead of falling apart. Green beans swapped with peas to offer a fresher bite, frozen handy but fresh works. Herb choice flexible; rosemary for pine notes but thyme works too. Cornstarch slurry ensures a velvety finish; mix cold water to avoid lumps. Adjust seasoning last—not earlier; salt concentrates during long cook."
instructionsNote: "Patience with browning pays dividends—surface dryness on meat required before frying or you’re steaming. Work in batches. After meat’s out, listen for a sizzle on veg, don’t rush caramelization—soft and gently colored, not burnt. Tomato paste needs a pre-cook to raw off flavors, don’t dump it in and pour broth immediately. When liquids hit, scrape pan thoroughly; that fond is magic. Simmer steady—bubble count low. Stir only occasionally to avoid breaking meat chunks. Thickness reliable by cornstarch slurry; stir slowly to dodge clumps. Lid off while thickening to let sauce concentrate. Add green beans frozen last minutes then just till bright green and tender yet crisp. Remove bay leaf before serving, bitter if left in too long. Taste often, adjust seasonings in final stage. Rest before serving; sauce thickens and flavors marry further."
tips:
- "Use a heavy pot; heat's key. Get oil hot, shimmering. Avoid steaming by leaving space. Cook meat in batches. Brown well. Don't skip this. Better texture from crust."
- "Want sweet veggies? Look for amber edges. Sauté gently. Don't rush or burn. Aromas evolve when caramelizing. Key to depth in flavor."
- "Tomato paste can’t just sit. Cook briefly before adding broth. Enhances depth. Scrape up fond bits for more flavor when you’re adding liquid."
- "Cornstarch for thickening? Mix with cold water. Avoid clumps; slow drizzle in while stirring. Leave lid off to concentrate sauce. Aim for stickiness."
- "Don’t overcook green beans; those last minutes. Drop in frozen. Keep that bright green crunch. Avoid mushy. Watch color; that's freshness."
faq:
- "q: Why is browning crucial? a: Crust adds depth. Locks flavor. Makes stew richer. Rushing leads to bland meat. Listen for sizzle. Watch steam."
- "q: Can I use different veggies? a: Yes; carrots, potatoes are solid choices. Don't overstuff with greens; balance needed. Texture matters; think crunch vs mush."
- "q: What if meat's tough? a: Cook longer on low. Should break apart, fork tender. Don't rush. Vigorous boil ruins it. Adjust seasoning at end."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Leave in pot; cool down first. Use airtight containers. Freeze for longer storage. But eat within a few days for best results."
