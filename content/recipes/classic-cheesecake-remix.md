slug: "classic-cheesecake-remix"
description: "A rich cheesecake with a crispy oat crust and a zesty cream cheese-lime filling. Adjusted sugar and flour amounts for balance. Uses Greek yogurt instead of sour cream for tang and creaminess. Browned butter swapped for melted coconut oil in the crust for subtle caramel notes. Baked in a water bath to avoid cracks, wrapped securely in foil to trap moisture. Bake time varied slightly to react to oven hotspots. Cooling and chilling steps emphasized to perfect texture."

ingredients:
- "===Crust==="
- "250 ml (1 cup) oat flour or finely ground oats"
- "20 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) light brown sugar"
- "50 ml (3 tbsp plus 1 tsp) melted coconut oil"
- "46 cm (18 in) heavy-duty aluminum foil sheet"
- "===Filling==="
- "225 ml (1 cup) granulated sugar"
- "20 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) cornstarch"
- "4 packages 250 g (8 oz each) cream cheese, softened"
- "180 ml (3/4 cup) full-fat Greek yogurt"
- "4 large eggs"
- "2 large egg yolks"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) lime zest plus juice"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) vanilla extract"
instructions:
- "===Preparation and crust==="
- "Center your oven rack. Preheat oven to 175 C (350 F). Line a 20 cm (8 in) springform pan bottom with parchment paper. Keep sides ungreased for better crust sticking."
- "Mix oat flour, brown sugar, and melted coconut oil in a bowl till crumbly but sticks when pressed. Tap into pan bottom firmly and evenly. Not too hard or crust gets tough. Bake 10-12 minutes till golden edges appear, smell toasted oats. Cool completely on rack. After cooling, grease sides with softened butter for easy cake release."
- "Wrap pan base and sides in 2 layers heavy aluminum foil. Foil must cover to at least 4 cm (1.5 in) above pan rim to seal water bath moisture. Prevent leaks, avoid soggy crust."
- "Lower oven heat to 165 C (325 F)."
- "===Filling==="
- "In food processor, pulse sugar with cornstarch to distribute starch evenly. Add cream cheese chunks; blend slowly until creamy with no lumps. Don't overblend – airiness causes cracks."
- "Add Greek yogurt, eggs, yolks, lime zest and juice, vanilla. Mix just until combined and smooth. Scrape sides. Avoid incorporating air. Batter should glide, slightly thick but pourable."
- "Pour filling gently over cooled crust. Even out surface with offset spatula, tapping pan lightly to release bubbles."
- "===Bain-marie and baking==="
- "Place springform pan inside a larger roasting pan. Carefully pour boiling water into roasting pan till water reaches halfway up springform sides. Water must be hot – helps bake cheesecake evenly, prevents cracking."
- "Bake 1 hour 50 minutes to 2 hours. Internal temp should reach 64-66 C (147-150 F). Edges firm and puffed, center slightly wobbly but set. The subtle jiggle means creamy custard inside."
- "Remove pan from water bath carefully. Peel off foil immediately to prevent condensation dripping and soggy crust."
- "Let cheesecake cool 1 hour on wire rack at room temp. Then refrigerate, covered loosely with foil/plastic for minimum 6 hours, ideally overnight. Texture firms and flavors meld."
- "Before serving, run thin blade around pan edges to loosen. Remove sides; crust should release cleanly. Use warm knife dipped in hot water for clean slices without cracking."
- "Enjoy creamy, tangy slices with fresh berries or a drizzle of honey. Store leftovers tightly wrapped in fridge for up to 4 days. Freeze in portions with parchment for longer storage."
- "===Tips==="
- "If Greek yogurt unavailable, sour cream is fine but balances sweetness differently. Use full-fat dairy for creamy texture; reduced fat yields rubbery results."
- "If no oat flour, pulse rolled oats a few seconds to fine crumbs, but avoid powdery flour."
- "Coconut oil adds subtle flavor and better texture than butter here. Butter can be substituted, but watch crust color; butter browns faster, reduce bake time slightly."
- "Don’t skip foil wrap under pan; water baths leak. Double wrapping saves mess and keeps moisture consistent."
- "Letting the cake cool fully then chill prevents surface cracks and maintains velvety mouthfeel."
- "Avoid pulling cake from fridge too soon – slicing firm cake avoids crumbling."
- "Food thermometer is the best doneness check, not timer alone – ovens vary wildly."
- "If cracks form despite precautions, cover them with fruit topping or chocolate ganache to mask flaws without wasting effort."
introduction: "Cheesecake's about texture below surface, that dense cream trap you'd kill for. Not just mixing ingredients, but controlling heat, butter/oil choice, water bath technique. Oat crust adds a nutty chew, coconut oil browned butter twist – unexpected. Greek yogurt good stand-in for sour cream – less watery, deeper tang. Sugar reduced to avoid sickly sweetness that masks cream cheese bright notes. Wrapped tightly in foil during bath; keep steam locked in. Oven temps lowered for gradual bake prevents cracked tops, more even heat penetration. Cooling steps vital – don't rush. Knife test, moisture test; those jiggly centers mean all is good. Slice right, not too soon, or you’ll lose precious creamy layer. Cheesecake isn't forgiving but nail these steps, and the payoff fills the room before the first bite."
ingredientsNote: "Oat flour in crust brings deeper flavor and better texture than graham crumbs, less likely to sog with coconut oil’s moisture balance. Brown sugar adds slight molasses note for balance; regular white sugar steers flat flavor. Coconut oil substitution advisable for richer aroma and easier melting, but unsalted butter works with precise timing to avoid crust overbaking due to milk solids. Greek yogurt replaces sour cream for less water content and tang with less risk of curdling during baking. Cornstarch instead of regular flour for filling thickens without pasty texture. Lime zest/juice adds subtle citrus brightness—swap lemon juice or vanilla for variation. Avoid overbeating cream cheese to keep cheesecake dense and moist, air causes cracks."
instructionsNote: "Line pan bottom with parchment for easy release but don’t grease sides to help crust grip walls. Pack crust with firm but gentle pressure to avoid tough bite. Wrap springform thoroughly in heavy-duty foil; double layering prevents leaks during water bath. Pour boiling water carefully to avoid splashing inside pan. Watch internal temp, pull cake when edges look dry and center slightly wobbly. Remove quickly from water bath and foil immediately to prevent condensation from softening crust. Cooling slow and patient—don’t rush chill or slice immediately. Use a thin, hot knife blade for clean cuts. If cracks appear, they’re cosmetic: fix with glaze or fresh fruit. Using a water bath reduces oven temperature fluctuations, yielding silky, crack-free cheesecake texture."
tips:
- "Chill cheesecake overnight; flavors meld beautifully. Rush cooling, texture suffers. Don't slice too soon. Wait until it's firm enough to hold shape but not hard."
- "Temp check is key. Internal must read 64-66 C. Wobbly center means creamy texture inside. Look for firm, puffed edges. Don't rely only on time."
- "Greek yogurt swaps well for sour cream. Less water means less chance of cracks. Full-fat dairy is best, ensures richness. Low-fat leads to rubbery texture."
- "Boiling water bath crucial; helps bake cheesecake evenly. Avoid splashes when pouring. Water helps control heat; watch for leaks. Wrap layers of foil tightly."
- "When making crust, pack it gently. Too hard, crust gets tough. Coconut oil adds a light caramel flavor; keep eye on crust color to avoid burning."
