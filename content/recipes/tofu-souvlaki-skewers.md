ingredients:
- "=== Skewers ==="
- "500 g firm tofu, large diced"
- "45 ml fresh lime juice"
- "40 ml olive oil"
- "3 cloves garlic, minced"
- "15 ml dried oregano"
- "2 ml crushed red pepper flakes"
- "200 g cherry tomatoes"
- "2 small shallots, cut into wedges"
- "salt and pepper"
- "=== Garnishes ==="
- "200 ml Greek yogurt"
- "1 clove garlic, minced"
- "15 ml fresh lime juice"
- "2 Lebanese cucumbers, thinly sliced"
- "5 ml dried dill"
- "4 pita breads"
instructions:
- "=== Skewers ==="
- "1. Toss tofu, lime juice, olive oil, garlic, oregano, crushed pepper, salt and pepper in a shallow glass dish or sealable bag. Let sit 20 minutes to absorb citrus brightness; tofu will soften without falling apart. Retain marinade for later."
- "2. Lightly oil grill grates; preheat barbecue medium-high. Aim for visible grill marks on tofu and vegetables to build flavor via Maillard browning, not just color."
- "3. Alternate threading tofu cubes, cherry tomatoes, and shallot wedges onto metal or soaked wooden skewers. Keep uniform size for even cooking. Cherry tomatoes add pop and juice unlike peppers which risk drying."
- "4. Grill skewers about 10 to 12 minutes total, turning frequently. Look for firm edges on tofu, blistered tomato skins, and softened shallot wedges. Tofu should slightly spring back, not mushy or burnt."
- "5. Remove from heat; immediately brush with reserved marinade to layer flavor and keep tofu moist."
- "=== Garnishes ==="
- "6. Combine Greek yogurt, garlic, half lime juice, and a good pinch of salt. Yogurt tang cuts through char while garlic punches the sauce, balancing richness."
- "7. Toss cucumbers with olive oil, remaining lime juice, dill, salt and pepper. Dill’s herbal brightness lightens the cucumbers’ crispness, offering contrast to tender grill items."
- "8. Warm pitas; spread the yogurt mix over each. Layer skewers and veggies, serve with cucumber salad alongside. Wrap and eat promptly to retain pita softness without sogginess."
introduction: "Firm tofu, but not just any firm tofu — perfect for grilling without falling apart. Marinating brightens it up, lime juice wakes it, oregano and garlic punch in herbal heat, crushed chili adds mild kick. Cherry tomatoes instead of peppers—juicy bursts instead of dry crunch, flavors that bloom over heat. Shallots give sweetness, caramelizing when they hit the hot grill. Visual cues matter here: golden grill marks, tofu slightly firm but tender, skins of tomatoes blistered and wrinkled but intact, shallots softened and sweet. On side, thick tangy yogurt tied with fresh lime and garlic; cucumbers dressed with dill for crisp freshness—dill, the herb you sometimes overlook but shouldn’t. Warm pita, spread with yogurt, adding tofu and veggies, quick fix for filling, fresh bites. Approach the grill with attention—don’t rush, don’t overpoke, flipping gently when edges start to caramelize. Kidney out char, not ash. The payoff is smoky, bright, layered textures and flavors that are all savory and vibrant."
ingredientsNote: "Firm tofu must still hold shape to be skewered and grilled—silken or soft tofu will crumble apart under heat. Press tofu well beforehand to remove excess moisture, but don't squeeze it dry or it gets rubbery. Lime juice shines here but lemon works in pinch. Olive oil helps carry fat-soluble flavors and prevents sticking—vegetable oil swap if preferred. Crushed red pepper flakes introduce subtle heat; leave them out for mild or add chipotle powder for smoky twist. Cherry tomatoes released juice during cooking, replacing original peppers’ textural role—you lose crunch but gain mellow sweetness. Shallots caramelize faster than onions; shortcuts to use regular red onions but expect longer grilling times. Greek yogurt replaces sour cream for tang and lighter texture, bonus protein boost. Dill is classic, but mint or parsley would also play nicely in cucumber salad. Pitas warm right on grill for authentic char or gently in oven if time is tight."
instructionsNote: "Marinate tofu no less than 15 minutes to infuse brightness and garlic, but avoid overly long marinades as citrus acidity can start to break down protein and lead to mush. Retain marinade for finishing glaze post-grilling, contributes moistness and flavor layers. Preheat grill thoroughly—never skimp here. Oiling grates avoids sticking, especially crucial for tofu surfaces. Skewer in consistent size blocks with veggies for even grilling; small cherry tomatoes blister quickly and can overcook fast—monitor closely. Flip often, looking for blistered skin and firm texture, use gently angled spatula or tongs, avoid piercing tofu which causes juice loss. Timing varies slightly with grill temp and size of cubes; rely more on visual and tactile cues than timer watch. Mix sauces and salads just before serving to keep freshness intact. Spread yogurt thickly enough to serve as cooling foil against spicy tofu. Assemble last moment to protect pita from sogginess, wrapping in foil or kitchen towel if holding. Watch grilling smoke too—too heavy smoke means flare-ups or charred bits; lift skewers off direct flame when required."
tips:
- "Marinate tofu for at least 15 min.  Longer can lead to mushy texture. Retain that marinade for brushing afterwards. Use firm tofu; silken won’t hold. Press well to remove moisture. It helps. Look for shiny, soft edges without crumbling."
- "Grill marks matter. Preheat properly; oil grates lightly. Don't rush flips. Watch for blistered tomato skins, firm yet tender tofu. Keep veggies uniform. Will cook evenly that way. Cherry tomatoes burst—carry moisture while grilling."
- "Use soaked wooden skewers or metal for firm grip. No need for sticks breaking. Avoid piercing tofu; lose juices. Shallots caramelize well. If using onions, expect longer grill time. They don’t sweeten fast. Keep watch."
- "Cucumber salad can be freshened with mint or parsley too. Toss cucumbers just before serving. Their crispness brings contrast. Dill is classic but explore variations. Serve the yogurt thickly spread. Balances char flavors nicely."
- "Warm pita right before assembly. Keeps it soft. Avoid sogginess—don't layer too long. Wrap in foil or a towel to shield. Quick assembly keeps everything fresh. Watch grilling smoke—heavy smoke can lead to charred bits."
faq:
- "q: How long can I marinate tofu? a: 15 minutes minimum. Too long, it breaks down. Citrus acidity does that. Avoid mushy texture. Stick with firm tofu not silken."
- "q: What if my skewers stick to the grill? a: Oil your grates well. Preheat thoroughly. Use tongs to gently lift. Resist the urge to poke. It can break apart."
- "q: What else can I serve with these skewers? a: Serve with tzatziki. Or a fresh salad. Pair with couscous or brown rice. Lots of options for contrasting textures."
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Keep skewers in the fridge tightly wrapped. Good for a couple days. Reheat gently on low heat. Grill briefly for crispness or microwave."
