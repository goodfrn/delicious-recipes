slug: "cheesy-macaroni-bake"
description: "Macaroni cooked al dente. Cheese sauce blends evaporated milk, broth, and a mix of cheddar, havarti, Velveeta. Topped with sharp gouda and parmesan for a crisp take. Baked quickly under broil, golden and bubbling. No mustard powder, replaced by smoked paprika. Onion powder swapped for shallot powder. Times adjusted by a few minutes throughout. Butter and flour start the roux. Sauce thickens before cheese melts in. Pasta warm and coated. Simmering minimal. Cannot skip broiling at the end for crustiness. Serve hot, 6 portions. Variations include adding crispy bacon or toasted breadcrumbs. Rich, gooey, crunchy, textural contrast. Easy, homey, modern twist to classic mac and cheese."

ingredients:
- "340 g short macaroni"
- "25 ml butter"
- "25 ml all-purpose flour"
- "2.5 ml smoked paprika"
- "1 ml shallot powder"
- "354 ml evaporated milk"
- "250 ml chicken broth"
- "250 g aged white cheddar grated"
- "200 g Havarti grated"
- "110 g Velveeta cubed"
- "150 g gouda grated"
- "50 g Parmesan grated"
instructions:
- "Bring salted water to a boil. Toss in macaroni. Cook until firm-tender. Drain and set aside."
- "Move oven rack to middle. Preheat oven on broil high. Butter an 8-cup baking dish or four 2-cup ramekins."
- "Melt butter in medium pot over medium heat. Add flour, smoked paprika, shallot powder. Whisk and cook 1-2 minutes."
- "Pour in evaporated milk and broth. Stir constantly. Bring to a gentle boil, sauce thickens slightly."
- "Remove from heat. Stir in 200 g cheddar, 200 g Havarti, and Velveeta cubes until melted and smooth."
- "Add macaroni to sauce. Heat 2-3 minutes, stirring often, ensuring pasta is coated thoroughly. Adjust salt if needed."
- "Spread mixture into prepared dish or ramekins. Evenly sprinkle gouda and Parmesan on top."
- "Broil for 4-6 minutes or until cheese topping is bubbly and turns golden brown."
- "Remove from oven. Cool slightly before serving to let cheese set. Serve warm."
introduction: "Macaroni boiled firm but not crumbly. Butter and flour cooked just until raw taste goes. Spices swap mustard and onion powder for paprika and shallot. Adds subtle fire, gentle tang. Evaporated milk with chicken broth creates a creamy but layered base. Cheese mix is heavier on white cheddar and Havarti yet includes Velveeta morsels for creaminess. Gouda and parmesan on top for crunch, a sharp punch. Broil versus bake longer for crisp caloric joy. Six servings ready in under an hour. Get ready for gooey, mellow heat, crunchy crust. All familiar comfort but shaken up."
ingredientsNote: "Butter amount trimmed slightly for less fat, maintained roux integrity with flour. Using smoked paprika instead of dried mustard powder introduces an earthy warmth instead of sharp tang. Shallot powder replaces onion for subtle sweetness and mildness. Gouda and parmesan make the topping different: no simple cheddar crust but complex mix of nuttiness and depth. Cheese quantities tweaked to keep creaminess but add textural contrast. Chicken broth for more flavor punch instead of plain water or milk alone. Small changes to classic aimed at layering, keeping it simple, boosting savor."
instructionsNote: "Pasta timing critical—al dente that can hold sauce but not crumble. Remove promptly, warming reserved. Roux cooked enough to eliminate raw flour but no color. When milk and broth added, stir intensely to avoid lumps, bring sauce just to boil until thickened. Immediately off heat for cheese melt—too hot or long, cheese loses silky texture. Combining pasta with sauce before topping ensures coating. Broiling 4-6 minutes varies with oven wattage but essential for crust formation. Watch carefully to prevent burning. Cooling short period to firm up the bake before serving improves mouthfeel. Serve hot but not scalding."
tips:
- "Cook macaroni al dente. Firm but not mushy. Drain immediately; waiting can lead to mushy pasta. Mixing sauce when pasta is hot helps it absorb flavors. Don't skip this step; ensure every piece coated."
- "Whisk roux properly; butter and flour should not brown, just cook long enough. Add evaporated milk and broth. Stir vigorously to avoid lumps. Bring to slight boil, then remove heat. Cheese added must melt smoothly."
- "Variations can include crispy toppings. Think bacon, toasted breadcrumbs, or herbs. Layered flavors enhance the dish. Bake timing might need adjusting based on your oven's power. Broiling is vital; crisp cheese gives texture."
- "Allow the dish to cool slightly after broiling. Cheese will set better. Cuts cleanly too if serving in pieces. Serve warm but not too hot. Avoid burning tongues; let it breathe."
- "Storing leftovers? Allow to cool completely. Store in airtight container. Can keep in fridge for up to three days. Reheat in oven for best texture. Microwave can make it rubbery; avoid if possible."
faq:
- "q: How to prevent macaroni from sticking? a: Stir frequently while cooking. Use enough water. Rinse briefly with cold water after draining if necessary. This helps separate pasta strands. Don’t skip this. It matters."
- "q: What if sauce is too thick? a: Thinner sauce can be created by adding more broth. Stir well. Can use milk as a backup. Adjust until desired consistency. Remember, this affects final dish texture."
- "q: Can leftovers be frozen? a: Yes, but texture changes. Store in freezer-safe containers. Can last up to two months. Thaw overnight in fridge before reheating. Best results come from slow reheating."
- "q: How to make it spicier? a: Add cayenne pepper or extra smoked paprika. Mix in chopped jalapeños or hot sauce too for kick. Adjust to taste during cheese addition. Bold flavors enhance dish."
