Quick, minimal oil method prevents soggy middles. Garlic hits you mid-cook, fragrant but not burnt. Paprika dust brings subtle heat, smokiness.

ingredients:
- "1 pound small Brussels sprouts, halved or quartered if large"
- "1 tablespoon avocado oil or grapeseed oil"
- "2 cloves garlic, minced"
- "1 teaspoon smoked paprika"
- "Salt and pepper, to taste"
- "Optional twist: 1 teaspoon maple syrup or balsamic glaze for finishing"
instructions:
- "Preheat air fryer to 375°F. Medium-high heat; aim for hot but not smoking."
- "Sprouts trimmed, halved to speed crisping; smaller pieces crisp faster, avoid dense soggy centers."
- "In mixing bowl, toss sprouts with oil—just enough to coat, keeps them dry for burnished edges."
- "Add minced garlic and smoked paprika directly to sprouts, blend well so all surfaces are seasoned."
- "Dump sprouts into air fryer basket in a single layer. Crowding steams, no crisp."
- "Cook for 7 minutes, then shake basket vigorously—hear the sprouts clatter, redistribute for even browning."
- "Cook another 8 minutes or until edges deep golden brown, sometimes bubbly, interior tender but with firm bite."
- "Watch closely last few minutes. Garlic smell changes from raw sharp to toasty, bellwether of doneness."
- "Optional: Drizzle maple syrup or balsamic glaze immediately after cooking for a sweet counterbalance to smoky heat."
- "Serve hot. Add flaky salt if you want punchy contrast."
introduction: "Brussels sprouts—many avoid, but once mastered, you're rewarded with crackly, smoky bites. Air fryer fast-tracks the crisp without drowning veggies in oil. Less fuss, more control. Tossing sparingly in high smoke point oil avoids greasy pitfalls. Garlic and paprika bring layers you won't get with plain salt and pepper. Watch and sniff. Garlic turns golden, papery edges curl. That sound? Sprouts bouncing, him crackling quietly as edges char to a rich brown. Not mushy, never soggy. Tactile cues indicate when to pull before bitterness creeps. Simple, not soft; bold, not burnt. Swap ingredients. Get creative but keep those principles. No mystery, just practical science working for you in minutes."
ingredientsNote: "Avocado oil chosen for high smoke point and neutral flavor—prevents bitter burnt taste common with olive oil in high heat. Grapeseed or light coconut oil substitutes keep sprout edges crisp without adding overpowering flavor. Minced fresh garlic heats fast; add early to infuse but watch closely to avoid blackening. Smoked paprika adds warmth and complexity; cumin or chili powder replace easily for different heat profiles. Avoid heavy dressings pre-cook—brussels need dry surface to crisp. Optional maple syrup or balsamic makes a quick glaze after air frying for layered flavor. Salt and pepper basics; always adjust to taste before serving. Trim sprouts to remove tough stems for even cooking and better mouthfeel."
instructionsNote: "Preheating air fryer crucial for immediate sear on sprouts and quick moisture evaporation—key for crunch. Tossing lightly, not drowning in oil, avoids sogginess. Single layer spreading inside basket prevents steaming, promotes direct heat exposure. Shake basket mid-cook; redistributes for even char, exposes all sides. Timing flexible; watch color and texture—edges should be a deep golden brown with slight blistering, interior still firm to bite. Garlic aroma transitions from raw pungent to nutty and toasty; rely on smell to avoid burnt bits. Avoid opening fryer too often; temperature drops slow cooking and diminish crisp. Add any glazes immediately after cooking before residual heat cools sprouts and glaze sets unevenly. Keep salt for last; accentuates texture and flavor contrast."
tips:
- "Humidity levels bother sprouts. Dry them well before tossing with oil. Helps achieve that crispy crunch. Avoid sogginess—big mistake."
- "Oil doesn’t need to drown. Just enough to coat. Coat lightly, keep edges crispy. Avocado oil’s your best friend at high heat. Flavor stays neutral."
- "Watch the garlic closely. It can turn from pungent to bitter fast. Always rely on smell—nutty and toasty is where you want to be."
- "Don’t crowd the basket. Leaving space allows air to circulate around the sprouts. Keep ‘em in one layer. Steaming ruins crispiness, just defeats the purpose."
- "Test different spices. Feel free to swap smoked paprika with cumin or chili powder. Variety keeps things interesting. Experiment enough for enjoyable outcomes."
faq:
- "q: What’s the best way to cut Brussels sprouts? a: Trim tough stems first. Halve for faster crisping. Quarter large ones. Smaller pieces cook quicker."
- "q: What if my sprouts aren’t crispy enough? a: Try shaking the basket more mid-cook. Adjust cooking time based on size. Little more heat, maybe even lower moisture."
- "q: Can I store leftover sprouts? a: Best eaten fresh. But if must? Airtight container. Refrigerate up to two days, reheat crispiness can be tricky."
- "q: What oils can I use instead? a: Grapeseed, light coconut work fine. Avoid strong flavored oils like olive—could burn, change taste. Stick to neutral oils."
