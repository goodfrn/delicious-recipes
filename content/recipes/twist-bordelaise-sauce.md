slug: "twist-bordelaise-sauce"
description: "Rich, reduced red wine and demi-glace sauce with roasted bone marrow and fresh herbs. Uses veal demi-glace instead of traditional beef. Replaces cognac with aged sherry. Brown sugar swaps with maple syrup for earthiness. Roasts marrow to coax fat release before quick sear. Sauce reduced until glossy, clings to meat. Finishes with tarragon and parsley mix. Aromas of caramelized shallots and roasted marrow dominate. Best with grilled ribeye or robust steaks. Practical moves to salvage marrow if stubborn. Emphasis on texture contrasts and layering deep savory notes."

ingredients:
- "3 veal marrow bones, cut 10-12 cm"
- "3 small shallots, finely minced"
- "30 ml butter"
- "20 ml maple syrup"
- "300 ml dry red wine (Cabernet Sauvignon preferred)"
- "1 sprig fresh tarragon"
- "300 ml veal demi-glace"
- "15 ml aged sherry"
- "25 ml chopped fresh herbs (flat-leaf parsley, tarragon)"
- "Salt and freshly cracked black pepper"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 200 C. Roast marrow bones for 12 minutes until fat bubbles and smells nutty. Let cool slightly, scrape marrow into 1 cm rounds. Marrow should be soft but still hold shape. If marrow sticks, use small knife around edges."
- "In skillet on medium-low heat, melt butter. Add shallots and sweat gently until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add maple syrup, stir 1 minute to caramelize without burning."
- "Pour wine into skillet, add tarragon sprig. Raise heat, boil gently until volume reduces by half and sauce thickens enough to coat back of spoon, about 12–15 minutes. Sharp aroma of wine concentrates now."
- "Add demi-glace. Simmer mixture, stirring regularly, until syrupy and rich, approx 10 minutes. Sauce should form thick ribbons when drizzled from spoon."
- "Add sherry, stir. Remove tarragon sprig. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Taste to adjust acidity and sweetness—maple syrup should offer subtle backdrop, not dominate."
- "In another hot skillet, sear marrow rounds quickly over high heat to brown exterior, about 1 minute per side. Look for golden crust, still soft inside."
- "Deglaze pan with reserved sauce. Warm gently, folding marrow into sauce. Add chopped fresh herbs last second to brighten and add fresh, slightly anise notes."
- "Serve hot, spoon marrow-laced sauce over grilled ribeye or steak frites. Sauce clings and melts into meat, marrow adds silky fat richness."
introduction: "Hit marrow bones hard with heat to unleash pure fat and flavor. Roasting first draws out nutty aromas and softens marrow for that creamy pop later. Sweat shallots slow so they soften but don’t burn—bitter ruins the whole thing. Maple syrup instead of sugar adds subtle woodsmoke, deeper than brown sugar, without clashing. Red wine reduction pulls sharp acidity and fruit to balance the fatty marrow. Veal demi-glace here—cleaner and richer than beef demi, lifts sauce thicker and silkier. Tarragon sprigs bring herbal brightness, slightly anise-like—a classic French tweak steering away from just thyme or rosemary. Sherry rounds out the sauce with warm nuttiness instead of fiery cognac, ideal if you’re out of brandy or want a mellow earthiness. Quick sear on marrow locks in texture but avoids grease overload. Final fold of fresh herbs lifts it, adding pop amid all that fat and reduction. Clingy sauce that hugs steak, making sauce and marrow one savory hit. No waste, all texture, all flavor."
ingredientsNote: "Veal bones offer cleaner marrow flavor, usually easier to find now in butcher shops or upscale markets; use beef marrow bones if unavailable, but reduce roasting time by a couple minutes to prevent over-rendering. Maple syrup stands in for brown sugar, adds subtle caramelized bitterness instead of overt sweetness—check quality maple with no additives. Red wine choice matters: pick a dry, fruity Cabernet or Merlot for balanced acidity. If you lack demi-glace, beef or veal demi-glace concentrates or a well-reduced beef stock can replace. Sherry or Madeira adds distinctive nutty body but cognac or brandy works fine as backup (just reduce quantity to avoid overpowering). Fresh tarragon replaced thyme for lively anise notes. Parsley mix with tarragon last minute brightens sauce and perfumes marrow fat with freshness. Butter quality influences shallot sweetness; European butter preferred for better mouthfeel. Salt late to avoid toughened shallots. Don’t skip roasting marrow bones first—it’s the foundation. If marrow too firm to paste, try quick 3-minute blast in hot pan after slicing."
instructionsNote: "Roasting marrow bones heats marrow slowly, rendering fat, and develops deep, nutty aromas—don’t skip, marrow texture suffers. Leave bones apart so heat surrounds marrow evenly. Watch shallots carefully, translucent without brown spots; low temp prevents bitter notes. When adding maple syrup, stir continuously to avoid burning—it’s delicate at this stage. Wine reduction key: slow boil until half volume gone but not dried up; sauce should coat spoon but not stick rock hard. Use medium heat for demi-glace addition to avoid burning sugars but keep sauce moving. Sherry goes in last to preserve aroma—boil off alcohol quickly but don't overheat or flavor dulls. Marrow searing is quick; these delicate rounds brown fast—listen for light hissing sound, look for golden crust but don’t cook marrow through or it’ll lose silky texture. Deglazing pan with sauce lifts crust flavors; fold marrow into sauce off direct heat to keep shape. Herbs chopped fine, folded in last second to preserve brightness; coarse herbs risk masking marrow’s silken balance. Serve immediately, sauce thick but fluid, marrow melting but structured. Sauce leftover? Reheat gently, thin with splash stock. Avoid overheating marrow when reheating: fat can separate."
tips:
- "Roast bones until fat bubbles—nutty aroma key, 12 minutes at 200 C. Softness matters too. Cool, scrape marrow into rounds. Keep shape. Add cooked marrow to sauce last second."
- "Sweat shallots low and slow, around 5 minutes. Avoid browning. Butter quality impacts sweetness. European butter is best. Caramelize maple syrup without burning. Stir constantly."
- "Wine reduction: crucial step. Add wine then concentrate flavors at medium heat. Half volume should be gone in 12-15 minutes. Sauce coats spoon but not rock-hard sticky."
- "For quick sear, high heat about 1 minute per side. Look for golden crust—soft inside. Fold seared marrow gently into sauce, not directly on heat, keep texture."
- "Storage tip: leftover sauce? Thin with stock, warm gently. Reheat marrow carefully—fat separates easily. If stubborn, cool bones after roasting, then pry with knife."
faq:
- "q: Can I substitute veal bones? a: Yes, beef marrow works fine. But reduce roasting time. Watch doneness. Don’t over-render or texture suffers."
- "q: What if wine is too acidic? a: Adjust with more maple syrup. Balance isn’t hard. Sweetness should sit back, not dominate. Experiment incrementally with flavors."
- "q: Why is the sauce too thick? a: Add stock gradually. If over-reduced, may lose balance. Monitor texture. Aim for thick yet pourable, not pasty."
- "q: How long can I store the sauce? a: Refrigerate up to 5 days. Freeze for longer storage. Just remember: thin again with stock when reheating. Avoid overheating marrow."
