ingredients:
- "1 ball pizza dough enough to roll 10-12 inch round"
- "1 teaspoon olive oil"
- "4 cups fresh spinach roughly chopped or 5 oz frozen spinach thawed and drained"
- "1 cup canned artichoke hearts drained and chopped"
- "3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese divided"
- "1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese divided"
- "4 ounces cream cheese softened"
- "3 tablespoons mayonnaise can swap plain Greek yogurt"
- "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder"
- "1/2 teaspoon onion powder"
- "salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste"
- "2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley for garnish"
- "optional drizzle olive oil before baking"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 460 degrees Fahrenheit and line a pizza stone or baking sheet with parchment paper; get hot for crisp edges. Meanwhile, dust your counter lightly and roll dough into a 10-12 inch circle, keep a rim about 1 inch thick. Don’t stretch too thin or it tears; thicker edge holds sauce and toppings better."
- "Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, toss in spinach and cook until wilted and liquid evaporates, about 3 minutes. If frozen, squeeze excess water to avoid soggy dough, cooling slightly before mixing keeps cheese from melting early."
- "In a large bowl, fold together cooled spinach, 3/4 cup chopped artichoke hearts, cream cheese, mayonnaise (or Greek yogurt for lighter), half the mozzarella, half the parmesan, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Mix until fully combined but still chunky. This base packs moistness and punch."
- "Spread the mixture evenly over the prepared dough, leaving that 1 inch edge clear. Too close to edge means burnt cheese or soggy crust. Don’t pile too thick or the pizza won’t bake through properly."
- "Top with remaining mozzarella cheese, reserved artichoke chunks scattered evenly, then sprinkle with last of parmesan. Optional olive oil drizzle around edges for sheen and crunch."
- "Bake on middle rack for 18-22 minutes, listen for crackling cheese and watch crust color. Golden brown crust that yields to gentle press but holds shape means done. Cheese should bubble but not scorch."
- "Let cool 5 minutes before slicing; garnish with parsley for fresh pop. Slicing hot can drag toppings or tear dough. Use a sharp wheel or bench knife."
- "If no pizza stone, use baking sheet but expect less bottom crisp. Double-check for soggy dough by lifting carefully with spatula. If soggy, next time pre-bake crust 3-4 minutes before topping."
- "Store leftovers in fridge wrapped tightly. Reheat in toaster oven or oven on low heat to refresh crust and melt cheese again; microwave makes it rubbery."
introduction: "Crisp crust, creamy cheesy spinach-artichoke blend for topping. Not your typical pizza with just marinara and cheese. Swap mayo with Greek yogurt if watching calories but mayo adds silk and browns nicely. Artichoke hearts double-layered for bite and to keep moisture under control. Spinach sautéed, press moisture out or dough slips into soggy territory. Don’t eyeball the bake time; watch crust and cheese bubbles. That golden edge snaps and cheese should bubble without turning brown like burnt rubber. Perfect for weeknights when you want decent home pizza without delivering local joint takeout. Prep straightforward, mixing flavors, rolling dough, layering thoughtfully. Easy to personalize. Parmesan lends pop and salt; mozzarella stretches and melts. Swap mozzarella with fontina or provolone for sharper taste. Parsley finish freshens the rich topping. Gluten-free dough works but expect texture change. Bake on stone or baking sheet with parchment makes cleanup easier and promotes even cooking. The difference between good and great pizza often in small details: drained spinach, loosened topping, edge rim thickness, and oven temp."
ingredientsNote: "Use fresh or frozen spinach depending on what’s on hand. Frozen must be fully thawed and squeezed dry; extra water ruins crust texture. Artichoke hearts canned in brine preferred for flavor, but marinated can add extra zing—adjust salt accordingly. Cream cheese gives creaminess but swap for ricotta if you like chunkier texture. Mayonnaise adds moisture and browning, can be replaced with plain Greek yogurt to reduce fats; expect slightly less browning from yogurt due to different sugar content. Mozzarella choice important—low moisture whole milk mozzarella melts better and avoids oily pools. Parmesan freshly grated packs more punch versus pre-grated. Parsley garnish is not decorative fluff—adds freshness that cuts richness. Olive oil thinning helps make dough flexible when rolling and adds flavor; oil on crust edge pre-bake contributes crisp shade and slight chew. Salt and pepper quantities should be balanced to avoid overpowering the delicate artichoke. Garlic and onion powders build depth without lumps caused by fresh minced garlic which can burn. Adjust quantities flexibly when scaling servings."
instructionsNote: "Starting hot oven crucial; 460 degrees gives fast crust rise and crisp. Rolling dough too thin risks tearing and chewy crust. Creating thick edge traps toppings and offers a handle when eating. Sauteing spinach briefly removes raw bitterness and excess moisture while releasing aromas—you’ll smell it soften. Cooling spinach before mixing so cheese doesn’t melt prematurely keeps texture intact. Mixing cheeses with mayo and cream cheese creates a stable topping that won’t run off dough during bake. Spreading evenly but not overcrowded ensures crumb structure cooks through. Double cheese layering adds melty texture but keeps topping moist and visually appealing. Baking in center rack avoids overbrowning bottom or top. Visual cues matter more than exact time; golden caramelized crust edges with bubbly cheese underneath means done. Let rest on wire rack before cutting to firm up. Use serrated or bench knife if wheel drags toppings. Storing leftovers wrapped keeps freezing moisture out. Reheat using dry heat oven helps restore crispness versus microwave which softens crust. Troubleshoot soggy crust by pre-baking dough or using less wet toppings next time."
tips:
- "Always preheat oven to 460 F. Hot means fast rise and crispness. Roll dough thick enough, 1 inch edge keeps toppings. Frozen spinach needs squeezing to avoid wet dough."
- "Use low moisture whole milk mozzarella. It melts beautifully, avoids greasy puddles. Parmesan should be fresh grated. Swap cream cheese for ricotta if chunkier is more desired."
- "Watch for visual cues. Cheese should bubble, not scorch. Crust edges need golden brown. Use a spatula to lift crust occasionally, check bottom for doneness, sogginess."
- "Double check moisture levels. Too much will wreck crust texture. If pizza soggy, pre-baking crust a few minutes next time can help. Keep toppings spread out."
- "Fresh parsley at the end brightens the rich topping. Garlic and onion powders deepen flavor without needing fresh. Olive oil drizzle around edges before baking adds crunch."
faq:
- "q: Can I use frozen spinach? a: Yes, but must squeeze out moisture first. Otherwise, the crust gets soggy. Choose thawed but dry."
- "q: What if my pizza crust is soggy? a: Solution is two-fold. Pre-bake crust before adding toppings. Or don’t overdo wet ingredients."
- "q: Can I store leftovers? a: Wrap tightly in the fridge, keeps moisture out. Reheat in the toaster oven. Avoid microwave; it softens crust too much."
- "q: What types of cheese can I substitute? a: Swap mozzarella for fontina for nuttier flavor. Provolone can work too but taste shifts."
