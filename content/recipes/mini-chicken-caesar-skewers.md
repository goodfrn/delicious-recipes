ingredients:
- "3 slices bacon thick cut"
- "3 skinless boneless chicken thighs"
- "2 white sandwich bread slices crusts removed cut into 24 1-1/2 inch squares"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) unsalted butter"
- "4 romaine lettuce leaves cut into 48 1-5/8 inch squares"
- "=== Dressing ==="
- "1 egg yolk"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) lemon juice"
- "1 small garlic clove minced"
- "100 ml (3 1/2 fl oz) canola oil"
- "10 ml (2 tsp) chopped capers"
- "2 ml (1/2 tsp) anchovy paste"
- "20 g (2 tbsp) finely grated Parmesan cheese"
instructions:
- "=== Bacon and Chicken ==="
- "Start with cold pan, medium heat. Lay bacon flat without overlap, listen for initial sizzle that settles. Cook 5-7 minutes flipping once; bacon should be browned but not crisped to fragility. Drain on paper towel to remove excess fat; reserve bacon fat for chicken cooking."
- "Increase heat slightly on same pan. Add chunked chicken thighs, season with salt and cracked pepper. Let sit undisturbed to develop golden crust about 6-7 minutes, turn to cook through until juices run clear and firm to touch. Remove and cool. Cut both bacon and chicken into 24 equal squares around 1 1/2 inches."
- "Wipe pan, melt butter over medium. Toast bread squares carefully, about 4-5 minutes flipping once, golden on both sides but not soggy. Set aside."
- "=== Dressing ==="
- "Whisk egg yolk, lemon juice, and garlic in a bowl vigorously. Drizzle first third of oil dropwise to start emulsification; slow straight stream once texture thickens into thick mayonnaise consistency. Fold in capers, anchovy paste, and half the Parmesan. Season with light salt if needed."
- "=== Assembly ==="
- "Lay bread squares on clean surface. Dollop 2 ml of vinaigrette per square. Stack chicken, bacon, two lettuce squares (for crunch and freshness), secure with cocktail sticks or mini skewers."
- "Top with remaining vinaigrette on lettuce and sprinkle remaining Parmesan."
- "Chill slightly before serving but let come close to room temp to avoid lettuce wilting rapidly under dressing."
- "=== Tips and Substitutions ==="
- "Chicken thighs preferred for juiciness; replace with diced chicken breast if leaner meat desired but reduces flavor depth."
- "Bacon fat adds flavor to chicken; if skipping bacon, use olive oil and a pinch of smoked paprika to mimic complexity."
- "Use mayonnaise store-bought as shortcut but whisking fresh yolk offers better flavor and texture. Caution with raw egg if serving to vulnerable guests."
- "Capers and anchovy paste indispensable here, but minuscule amounts mean subtle saltiness and umami - omit only if allergic or unavailable, add a pinch of soy sauce as fallback."
- "Bread can stale slightly beforehand for better toasting; fresh bread will absorb butter quickly and become soggy."
- "Watch bread toast closely: color cues more reliable than clock. Golden brown means Maillard reactions, crisp outside, eyes on quick flip timing."
- "Lettuce must be dry to avoid soggy bites; rinse then spin or pat with towels thoroughly."
- "Use cocktail sticks that aren’t too thick to avoid tearing bread but sturdy enough to hold layers intact."
introduction: "Small bites layered with meat, bread, and greens, all cloaked in a tangy creamy dressing. The bacon renders rich fat, which seasons the chicken as it browns—no wasted flavor. Toasted bread acts as a sturdy base; its browning marks flavor thresholds worth watching, too pale and it’s limp, too dark and it burns. Lettuce adds necessary freshness and crunch, balancing rich proteins and fat. Dressing whisked from scratch, using a controlled oil addition to transform thin egg and acid into lush emulsion. Salt, acid, umami - all hits in a tiny package. Assembly is simple but precision in layering elevates each bite."
ingredientsNote: "Using thick bacon optimizes render time and flavor; thin slices cook too fast and char unevenly. Always remove crusts from bread to maintain uniform bite size and reduce toughness. Butter chosen for toasting adds nuttiness and encourages browning beyond oil alone. Romaine holds crisp texture under dressing; iceberg or butter lettuce lack structural integrity. Anchovy paste replaces whole fillets for ease but maintains necessary savory depth. Capers cut with sharp briny notes; chop finely to distribute evenly without overpowering. Oil type matters. Canola neutral, light enough for emulsions; olive oil can break dressing if too strongly flavored or added too fast."
instructionsNote: "Start cold with bacon to draw out fat evenly. Listening for subsiding sizzle indicates balanced heat—too hot and edges will burn. Chicken skin off; skin traps steam, unreachable heat inside leads to uneven cooking. Pat chicken dry before seasoning to maximize Maillard browning. Use fork or tongs for turning only when chicken shows released easily, sticking means not ready to flip. Toast bread with careful eyes; flipping early tears crumbs, flipping late burns surface. Cold bread straight from fridge won’t toast evenly; room temperature ideal. Emulsion technique crucial: drip oil gradually while whisking furiously for paste-like vinaigrette. Too fast oil addition leads to broken dressing. Assembly—layer in order bread, dressing, chicken, bacon, lettuce, secured with skewers for stability. Avoid overdressing lettuce to prevent wilting, add parmesan last for texture contrast. Chill before serving to meld flavors but avoid soggy bites due to moisture release."
tips:
- "Use cold pan for bacon. Spread it flat. Listen for sizzle. Medium heat helps cook evenly. Keep it soft, not crispy. That's key."
- "Season chicken thighs generously. Let sit undisturbed. Browning builds flavor. Don't rushFlip them only when they lift easily. Juices should run clear."
- "Focus on the dressing emulsion. Whisk vigorously at first. Drizzle oil slowly. Helps create that creamy texture. Skip over fast pouring or emulsion breaks."
- "Watch bread closely while toasting. Golden brown is right—too pale means soggy. Flip carefully to avoid tearing. Room temp bread to prevent uneven toasting."
- "Capers and anchovy paste are non-negotiable. They add depth. Omit them if allergic. If not on hand, try a splash of soy sauce instead."
faq:
- "q: How can I store leftovers? a: Best kept in an airtight container. But separate components. Keeps bread from getting soggy. Can reassemble when ready."
- "q: What if I can't find bacon? a: Try pancetta instead. Good fat rendering, similar flavor. Or use olive oil, not as rich but better starter."
- "q: Why is my dressing breaking? a: Likely added oil too fast. Go slower next time. Also, make sure yolk was fresh, check for quality."
- "q: Can I use a different bread type? a: Yes but pick wisely. Something sturdy. Avoid light fluffy bread. Sog will ruin the texture."
