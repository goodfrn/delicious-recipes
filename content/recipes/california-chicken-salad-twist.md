ingredients:
- "=== Vinaigrette ==="
- "60 ml (4 tbsp) mayonnaise"
- "100 ml (about 7 tbsp) plain yogurt"
- "The pulp of 2/3 mango, finely chopped"
- "20 ml (4 tsp) Dijon mustard"
- "Juice of 3/4 lemon"
- "Dash of hot sauce (Tabasco or similar), to taste"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
- "=== Salad ==="
- "1 head of Boston lettuce, torn"
- "1 litre (4 cups) baby spinach"
- "500 ml (2 cups) arugula"
- "2 ripe avocados, pitted and sliced into strips"
- "3 skinless chicken half-breasts, grilled or pan-seared, then cooled and sliced"
- "1 mango, peeled, pitted, sliced in thin strips"
- "1/3 cucumber, diced small"
- "1 small shallot, very thinly sliced"
- "150 ml (2/3 cup) walnuts, toasted lightly"
instructions:
- "=== Preparation ==="
- "1. Start with vinaigrette. Use blender or food processor. Combine mayo, yogurt, mango pulp, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, hot sauce, salt, and pepper. Puree until creamy with small mango bits visible. Adjust seasoning. Set aside."
- "2. For chicken, if not pre-cooked, pan-sear half-breasts over moderate heat until juices run clear and surface is golden; rest 10 minutes before slicing. Avoid drying out; look for firm but tender texture."
- "3. Prepare the salad base. Tear Boston lettuce into large bite-sized pieces. Rinse spinach and arugula thoroughly; spin dry until leaves have a slight crisp snap but no limpness. Combine carefully to avoid bruising greens."
- "4. Slice avocado just before plating to prevent browning. Use a sharp knife for thin, neat strips."
- "5. Peel and slice mango thinly to keep brightness in each bite. Dice cucumber finely to spread crunch evenly. Thinly slice shallots paper-thin for subtle sharpness — rinsing briefly in cold water if too pungent."
- "6. Toast walnuts in a dry pan until warm fragrance emerges and surface slightly cracks but not burnt; toss often. Remove immediately to cool and retain crunch."
- "7. Arrange salad on 4 plates with mixed greens as base. Lay avocado, chicken, mango in an alternating star pattern for balance of color and texture; small apples of cucumber and shallot scatter around."
- "8. Drizzle vinaigrette evenly around and over salad; not drowning, just enough to coat leaves and accent flavors."
- "9. Finish with walnut garnish, scatter lightly without clumping."
- "=== Serving tips ==="
- "Serve promptly to preserve freshness and prevent greens from wilting under vinaigrette. If making ahead, keep dressing separate. Consider chilled plates to help maintain cool crisp textures, especially on warm days."
- "This salad holds subtle complexity from balance: creamy dressing cut by lemon and heat, crisp nuts against tender chicken and ripe fruit. Watch timing; avoid limp avocados or overdressed leaves—a flat salad kills the point."
introduction: "Green leaves, vibrant mango, creamy avocado — a salad asking for attention. Use Boston lettuce for delicate crunch; spinach’s mildness softens, arugula sharpens contrast. Chicken adds protein heft, sliced just so: no ragged edges, no dryness. Pairing citrus and Tabasco in the dressing wakes up everything. Mayonnaise and yogurt.Thick coats the greens without drowning. Toasted walnuts replace pacanes — sometimes the more rustic option adds dimension; slightly bitter edge marries with sweetness. A half shallot trades pungency for nuanced bite. Timing is critical: avocados sliced too early turn brown, wilt creeps faster when dressing lingers too long. Cool ingredients make a difference — chicken straight from fridge, no sweat, no soggy leaves. A practical, layered dish, relying on technique not gimmicks. Look, listen, feel greens; you’ll know exactly when it’s ready to serve."
ingredientsNote: "Adjust mango quantity based on ripeness and size; sweeter fruit yields smoother vinaigrette. Substitute walnuts with pecans or almonds if needed — lightly toast to release oils and aroma. Mayonnaise can be swapped for Greek yogurt for lighter dressing, but expect less richness and a thinner pour. Use lemon juice fresh every time; bottled lacks brightness and dims layers. Shallots used here for subtlety, but thinly sliced red onions still work if that's all on hand—rinse and dry to tame sharpness. Baby spinach replaces half original quantity, balanced with arugula to boost flavor bite. Keep avocado handling gentle: use a plastic knife to prevent browning reaction if needed. Cook chicken with skin on if preferred for moisture; strip skin post-cook to keep presentation clean."
instructionsNote: "Vinaigrette blending is key: pulse to retain small mango pieces, adding texture contrast; over-blending turns it too watery. Chicken doneness isn’t about minutes, but firmness — slight bounce indicates juiciness retained. Searing chicken develops Maillard crust; listen for steady sizzle, adjust heat to medium to avoid burning. Dry greens thoroughly to prevent dressing dilution and swift sogginess. Tear lettuce by hand for natural texture edges; knife cuts cause oxidation and browning. Assemble salad just prior to serving to keep colors vivid. Layering avocado between chicken and mango protects against oxidation while enhancing texture from creamy to chewy to juicy. Don’t drown salad under vinaigrette; the point is a light glaze. Toast nuts over medium heat, stir constantly—aroma and color changes signal readiness, not a timer. Keep nuts moving to avoid bitterness. Chill plates if ambient temperature is over 24°C to preserve crispness longer."
tips:
- "For vinaigrette, blend until creamy, but keep small mango bits. Don’t overdo it. Pulse briefly. Retain bite. Adjust lemon juice for tartness. Hot sauce should hit you, but not overwhelm. If bland, squeeze more lemon. Common mistakes: over-blend makes it watery."
- "Chicken texture checks: firm is juicy; no pink juices. Resting prevents drying. Techniques vary—pan-sear or grill; both work. Juicy chicken equals great salad. Skin-on can add moisture; remove after cooking for presents without mess."
- "Greens handling: Wash and spin for crispness. Tear lettuce by hand. Cut edges brown. Baby spinach should feel firm, not limp. Rinse arugula gently; bruising ruins crispiness.Rough chopping increases bruising—take care. Peachy moment, avoid limp greens."
- "Toast walnuts: medium heat, constant stirring. Listen for sizzling sound, smell the nutty aroma. Timing is vital; burnt nuts ruin crunch. Cool quickly to retain crunch factor. Keeping nuts in pan longer? Bad call, bitterness takes over. Flavor obfuscation."
- "For salad assembly, layer colors. Alternate patterns, visual importance matters. Presentation gives emotional urgency. Nuts should be scattered, clumped looks messy. Don’t drown biodegradable greens. Vinaigrette: coat lightly. Too much dressing leads to soggy disaster, salad doesn’t pop."
faq:
- "q: How to prep mango for salad? a: Peel then slice thinly. Keep uniformity in slices. Bright presentation matters. Ripe fruit is key. Too soft? Choice will yield mushy texture."
- "q: What if dressing is too thick? a: Thin with a touch of water. Adjust lemon juice for tart contrast. Mayonnaise swaps yield different consistency; keep notes. Yogurt could thin dressing."
- "q: Avocado browning solutions? a: Slice just before serving. If pre-sliced, brush with lemon juice—immediate fix. Store in airtight bag but won’t last long."
- "q: Can I make this salad ahead? a: Yes, but keep dressing separate. Ingredients will wilt if mixed too early. Layer everything nicely; assembly matters, colors muted ruin visuals."
