- "15 ml cornstarch"
- "125 ml 15 percent cream"
- "tarragon leaves chopped"
instructions:
- "Heat large non-stick skillet over medium-high. Brown chicken in olive oil 8 minutes per side. Remove chicken."
- "Add sweet potatoes and shallots. Sauté 6 minutes stirring often. Season salt pepper."
- "Pour 250 ml broth in. Boil. Cover, reduce heat. Simmer 16 minutes or potatoes get tender."
- "Return chicken to pan. Add frozen veggies. Cover. 7 minutes more or veggies soften."

introduction: "Chicken breast, skinless. Sweet potatoes in big cubes. Shallots replace garlic—milder, sweeter. Olive oil, not butter. Frozen green beans and peas mix swapped in. Cornstarch blended into cream and broth, thickens quicker. Tarragon leaves tossed for aroma. Brown chicken slow, medium heat. Then potatoes and shallots jump in. Pour broth, simmer, cover. Potatoes to tender. Chicken back. Veggies freeze mix in. Another simmer wrapped. Cornstarch cream mixture swirled in last. Thickens sauce till just right. Sprinkle herbs and serve quick. Simple, chopped, layered, chunks, flavors distinct but meet in sauce."
ingredientsNote: "Bone-in chicken breasts hold flavor and moisture better here. Sweet potatoes change texture and add subtle sweetness replacing Yukon Golds. Olive oil instead of butter cuts some richness, keeps sauce lighter. Shallots give sweetness and soften better than garlic. Frozen green beans and peas handy for consistent quality and quick cook—no wash, no peel. Cornstarch in cream plus broth simplifies thickening, no lumps quick done. Tarragon instead of parsley adds a sharper herbal note. Salt and pepper seasoning basic but essential, adjust per taste and broth saltiness. Quantities tweaked to balance flavors with swaps."
instructionsNote: "Start by browning chicken first to seal juices and build base flavor. Removing chicken lets you sauté potatoes and shallots in same pan, embedding flavor. Adding one cup broth, simmer covered, steams potatoes gently through. Bring chicken back in with frozen veggies, cover again to cook veggies without overcooking earlier ingredients. Whisk starch in cream and remaining broth so slurry blends easily without clumps. Stir it in last off heat or low to avoid curdling or lumps. Cook till sauce thickens but still pourable—watch carefully. Tarragon added near end so fragrance stays bright. Serve hot in shallow bowls, hearty chunks visible, sauce coats everything."
tips:
- "Brown chicken first max heat. 8 minutes each side. Locks in moisture. Builds flavor base. Takes time but pays off. Don’t skip this. Important step. Then remove. Keep juices."
- "Use sweet potatoes. Big cubes are the best. They add sweetness. Textures smooth. Yukon Gold swaps change taste too much. Stick with sweet. Easy to handle."
- "Sauté shallots with potatoes. Six minutes. Stir often. Salt and pepper essential. Season while sautéing. Layers of flavor build here. Always taste as you go."
- "Cornstarch in cream saves time. Mix with remaining broth. No lumps. Blend well. Stir in slowly to prevent curdling. Cook till thickens just right. Watch carefully."
- "Finish with tarragon. Adds sharper note. Sprinkle just before serving. Fresh aroma bursts out. Great flavor contrast. Half a handful enough. Play with amounts."
faq:
- "q: Can I use chicken thighs or tenders? a: Yes you can. Thighs bring richer flavor. But tenders are faster to cook. Adjust time if swapping."
- "q: What if I don’t have sweet potatoes? a: Yukon Golds also work. Different texture. More starch. Taste changes too. Experiment according to your preference."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool quickly after meal. Fridge in airtight container. Eat in 3 days. Freezing okay too. But texture may change."
- "q: Can I add other vegetables? a: Absolutely. Carrots are great. Or bell peppers add crunch. Just adjust cooking time if adding harder veggies. Think balance."
