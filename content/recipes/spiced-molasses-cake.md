slug: "spiced-molasses-cake"
description: "Dense gingerbread cake with molasses, cinnamon, and a hint of clove. Butter-sugar creamed then eggs folded in for fluff; milk alternated with spiced flour blend to keep the batter light. Frosted with cream cheese, butter, extra molasses, and cinnamon whipped into thick clouds, thinned with cream to just spreadable. Two layers, trimmed flat, sealed with a generous cream cheese molasses frosting that sticks like a charm. Cool before frosting or it will slide off. Gingersnaps garnish adds crunch and balance. Watch for classic signs: toothpick clean out cues doneness perfectly. Dark pans require drop in temp to avoid burnt edges."

ingredients:
- "2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour"
- "1 3/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon"
- "1 1/4 teaspoons ground ginger"
- "1/4 teaspoon ground cloves"
- "1 teaspoon baking soda"
- "1/2 teaspoon baking powder"
- "1 cup unsalted butter softened"
- "3/4 cup light brown sugar packed"
- "3/4 cup granulated sugar"
- "3 large eggs"
- "1 cup molasses (unsulphured)"
- "1 cup whole milk"
- "=== Frosting ==="
- "8 ounces cream cheese softened"
- "1/2 cup unsalted butter softened"
- "1 tablespoon molasses"
- "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon"
- "4 cups powdered sugar sifted"
- "2 to 3 tablespoons heavy cream"
- "=== Added twist ==="
- "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg for batter"
- "1 teaspoon espresso powder mixed with molasses in frosting"
instructions:
- "=== Cake ==="
- "Preheat oven to 345°F for regular pans or 320°F if using dark/non-stick. Line bottoms of two 9-inch pans with parchment paper; spray sides with neutral oil spray. Rest aside."
- "Whisk together flour, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, baking soda, and baking powder in a medium bowl. Shake lumps free, get even mix."
- "In large bowl, cream softened butter with both sugars until light color and airy texture about 3-4 minutes on medium speed. Scrape sides; do not rush."
- "Add eggs one at a time beating until each is fully incorporated. Don’t overbeat here or batter will break down."
- "Pour in molasses blended with espresso powder (classic bitter notes cut the sweet), beat until fully mixed."
- "Alternate adding 1/3 milk, then 1/3 dry flour mix, repeat until all combined. Start and end with milk for best hydration and structure. Fold gently, avoid overmixing starches."
- "Divide batter evenly into pans, smooth edges with offset spatula. Tap pans on counter to release air bubbles."
- "Bake 22 to 29 minutes. Watch edges pulling slightly from sides, top springy but set. Toothpick inserted near center must come out clean with few moist crumbs but no wet batter."
- "Cool in pans 12 minutes. Run butter knife around edges before gently inverting cakes onto racks, remove parchment. Cool fully to room temperature before frosting."
- "=== Frosting ==="
- "Beat cream cheese and butter on medium speed until combined smooth but not runny; if too warm, chill 10 mins before continuing."
- "Add molasses and cinnamon; beat until fluffy and homogeneous in texture."
- "Gradually add powdered sugar one cup at a time, beating well after each addition. Mixture will become thick and stiff, scratch sides often."
- "Drizzle 2 tablespoons heavy cream while beating to loosen consistency. Stop when frosting spreads without sliding off. Adjust with more powdered sugar or cream to suit climate and butter softness."
- "=== Assembly ==="
- "Using serrated knife trim dome off tops of cake layers, firm flat surfaces prevent sliding."
- "Place first cake layer with trimmed side up on serving plate. Spread about ½ cup frosting evenly over surface to edges."
- "Carefully invert second cake layer trimmed side down onto frosting. Press down lightly to seal evenly without squishing filling out the sides."
- "Use spatula to slather remaining frosting on top and around sides in thick even coat. Thermostat rules: too warm frosting slides, too cold tears cake."
- "Decorate with gingersnaps pressed into sides or sprinkle ground cinnamon atop for rustic look."
- "Refrigerate to set frosting firm or freeze if saving for later. Remove 30 minutes before serving for ideal texture."
introduction: "Molasses and spices thick in the air. Butter creamed golden, sugars dissolve in fluffy clouds. Eggs whipped in until batter sings light but sturdy—keys to keep crumb tight but not dry; a sweet spice melody with a pinch of unexpected nutmeg for depth. Oven temps tweaked depending on pan color—dark wants gentle heat or edges turn bitter burnt, a familiar pitfall. Cream cheese frosting not just sweetness but tang, where molasses gives bite deep in smooth rich cream. Espresso powder added, silent partner balancing sugar from frosting's overload. Always trim the dome, flat layers mate better, keep frosting from a messy slide. Gingersnaps decorate crispness, contrast to soft crumb. Once cooled completely before frosting—warm cake makes frosting bleed off sides—aroma draws you in early. Recognizing done by toothpick as queen signals, crumb moist but not raw—no one wants gummy cake. Patience pays here."
ingredientsNote: "Flour should be all-purpose to keep structure uniform but cake flour swap possible if lighter crumb desired, adjust liquids accordingly. Cloves often overpower; use sparingly or replace with allspice for smoother warmth. The nutmeg twist pulls out richer spice profile, try fresh grated for aroma. Molasses must be unsulphured for cleaner taste; blackstrap will dominate bitterness. Butter softened at room temp but not melted—too soft turns batter oily and dense; still firm allows proper aeration when creamed. Brown sugar adds moisture and depth; if unavailable, increase granulated sugar by 1/4 cup and add 2 tablespoons honey for molasses echo. Milk is whole for fat content balancing crumb tenderness but can substitute buttermilk for delicate tang and rise, expect slightly more browning. Espresso powder optional but real game changer in frosting, adding bitter undertone to cut sweetness. Powdered sugar fresh and sifted prevents gritty lumps in frosting; heavy cream thins but go slow or frosting runs off. Balance right or frosting will gutter down cake’s side. Ideally cream cheese at room temp to avoid tough unmixed gel patches."
instructionsNote: "Cream butter-sugars properly—it's the backbone for air into cake. Under creamed means dense, over creamed can collapse structure. Beat eggs one at a time, timing matters—folding slowly preserves moisture but overmix flour risks gluten toughness. Use the classic alternating milk and flour method to avoid lumps, helps batter finish fluffy yet not dense. Pans must be prepared well—parchment on bottom stops sticking; oil on sides ensures release. Testing doneness by toothpick, don’t trust timer alone, ovens differ wildly. Cool cake partially in pan but remove while still warm to avoid soggy crust. Crumb dries if rushed cooling in fridge, so room temp is key. Frosting needs proper consistency—too stiff scrapes cake, too loose runs off like winter thaw. Adjust with cream or sugar slowly to get spreadable creamy frost that holds shape. Trim dome to vaulted flat; rough tops mean uneven layers, disastrous when stacking. Press layers with gentle hand; pressing too hard pushes filling out creating mess. Chill frosted cake if humidity is high to prevent melt. Gingersnaps or crushed nuts add textural punch; optional but worthwhile tweak for bite contrast. Refrigerate leftovers tightly covered to preserve moisture. Freeze layers individually wrapped for longer storage; thaw slowly to prevent condensation."
tips:
- "Check butter texture. Soft but not melting. Creaming incorporates air. Overdoing it leads to collapse. Do not rush."
- "Eggs should be at room temperature. Helps batter mix well. One at a time. Keeps moisture even. Avoid lumpy mixes."
- "Molasses selection matters. Unsulphured only. Blackstrap too bitter. Adds complexity but can turn off those not fond of strong flavors."
- "Baking time important. Check edges and spring back. Toothpick in center—target clean crumbs, not streaks. Remove from pan. Cool fully."
- "Frost only when cake is room temp. Warm cake melts frosting, makes it slide. Chill layers if needed. Layer flat, trim domes."
faq:
- "q: How can I ensure my cake rises correctly? a: Room temp ingredients help mix evenly. Avoid overmixing after flour added. Adjust oven temp if necessary."
- "q: My frosting is too runny. What to do? a: Gradually add powdered sugar until thick. If too stiff, drizzle in cream slowly. Adjust as needed."
- "q: What’s the best way to store leftovers? a: Wrap tightly at room temp for short term. Refrigerate longer. Freezing layers works too. Just thaw slow."
- "q: Can I use different spices? a: Sure, but be careful. Cloves can overpower. Nutmeg is a great balance. Use fresh for best aroma. Experiment small."
