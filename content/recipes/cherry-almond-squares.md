- ""
- "=== Almond cream ==="
- "100 g (3/4 cup packed) almond meal"
- "20 g (2 1/2 tbsp) cornstarch"
- "12 ml (3 tsp) all-purpose flour"
- "100 g (7 tbsp) unsalted butter, softened"
- "140 g (2/3 cup) granulated sugar"
- "2 eggs"
- "50 ml (3 tbsp plus 1 tsp) whole milk"
- "12 ml (2 1/2 tsp) kirsch cherry brandy"

- "25 g (3 tbsp plus 1 tsp) sliced almonds"
- "15 g (2 tbsp) unsweetened shredded coconut, toasted"
instructions:
- "=== Oven and pan prep ==="
- "Set rack in middle position. Heat oven to 175 C (350 F). Grease 20 cm (8 inch) square pan. Line base with parchment strip leaving a few centimeters over two sides—makes lift out easier."
- ""
- "=== Form shortcrust base ==="
- "In bowl, blend sorghum flour and powdered sugar well. Cut softened butter in by finger-tipping, pinch and rub until mixture looks moist crumbs. No lumps of butter. Press firmly into pan bottom. Uniform thickness, no thin spots—avoid burned edges."
- "Bake for roughly 12 minutes. Look for pale golden edges, still soft center but dry to touch. Should smell nutty with faint toffee notes. Let the base cool slightly but keep oven hot."
- ""
- "=== Prepare almond cream ==="
- "Whisk almond meal, cornstarch, and flour in a small bowl. Sets texture, stops cream from weeping or sagging—key for a firm set without rubberiness."
- "In separate large bowl, use electric mixer to cream butter and sugar for 2-3 minutes till pale, fluffy, slight shine, no granules."
- "Add eggs one at a time, fully blending after each. Pause mixing once eggs are in to avoid overbeating—cream won't deflate or separate."
- "On low speed, add dry ingredients alternating with milk and kirsch. Start and finish with dry. Mix just to combine—you want smooth but not airy or frothy."
- ""
- "=== Assemble and bake ==="
- "Pour almond cream evenly over hot pastry base. Smooth with offset spatula quickly before it starts to set."
- "Scatter drained Morello cherries evenly on top, gently pushing them into the cream."
- "Sprinkle sliced almonds followed by the toasted coconut flakes. Coconut offers nutty chew and a contrast in texture plus a hint of tropical aroma."
- ""
- "Slip into oven. Bake around 1 hour 5 minutes. Watch for edges and surface turning golden brown with slight crackles—listen for soft crackling sounds indicating crust set."
- "Test center gently with fingertip: springy but firm, no wobble or jiggly spots. An inserted toothpick comes out mainly clean with a few moist crumbs."
- ""
- "=== Cooling and serving ==="
- "Remove from oven. Leave in pan until room temperature. The cream firms as it cools. For clean cut edges, refrigerate at least 1 hour before slicing."
- "Use a sharp knife warmed under hot water and wiped dry for smooth cuts, wipe knife between slices to avoid crumbs."
- ""
- "Store squares in airtight container at room temperature for up to one week. Avoid refrigeration for long storage or cream yellows and texture toughens. Troubled by fruit wetness? Line bottom with a thin layer of ground almonds before cream to catch excess moisture."
introduction: "Shortcrust base, almond cream, Morello cherries. Nutty aromas fill kitchen. Butter and sugar creamed just right, eggs folded gently. Watch golden edges, listen to crackle, learn oven language. Sorghum flour swap for gluten-free flair. Kirsch cherry brandy instead of amaretto adds tart brightness—no syrupy sweetness. Coconut flakes toast on dry pan, add crunch and scent. Cherries scattered like jewels over fluffy almond cream, slipping into warm oven. Fingers test firmness. One hour plus remember, not advertised times. Rest, cool, slice clean — sharp knife's your friend. Refrigerate before cutting or risk mastication nightmare. Week-long shelf life with airtight container, but keep out heat. Real deal technique, no fluff. Patience, eye, touch essential."
ingredientsNote: "Sorghum flour replaces white flour for a tender crumb edge when gluten-free is needed. Powdered sugar integrated in the dough prevents graininess while providing subtle sweetness. Butter must be softened not melted—warm, pliable, easy to press but not greasy. Almond meal should be fresh; stale nuts ruin flavor. Cornstarch and a touch of flour give structure without toughness. Kirsch sharply cuts sweetness, accenting cherry flavor over amaretto’s mellow nuttiness. Drain fruit very well or cream will weep. Toasted coconut flake adds crunch, aroma, an unexpected twist. Feel free to swap coconut for crushed macadamia for texture if allergic. Don't substitute margarine—loses flavor and texture. Eggs room temp for better emulsion, no scrambled curds. Milk adds fluidity; whole milk preferred but plant milk like oat works as alternative."
instructionsNote: "Precise oven rack placement counts. Middle rack ensures even cooking - too low burns base. Parchment strip edges must be long enough to grip and lift out baked square intact. Press dough evenly, thin edge or thick patches create uneven baking - watch color closely. For almond cream, folding dry into wet gently maintains lightness—overmixing sinks batter. Butter and sugar properly creamed gives aeration for softness without collapse. Watch for aroma cues: nutty crust scent and faint caramel signals base ready. When baking almond cream layer, listen for soft crackling surface, fragile browning. Toothpick isn’t foolproof—combine with gentle jiggling. Cool completely before cutting or cream spills. Warm knife tips reduce crumble, wipe blade between cuts avoids clogs. Store airtight; moisture deteriorates texture. If cherries too juicy, sprinkle almond meal on pastry before cream to absorb excess liquid. Always test one square to gauge baking progress. This method demands patience and sensory attentiveness, no shortcuts."
tips:
- "Use softened butter, not melted. Mix till crumbly, no lumps. Press firmly into the pan. Look for no thin spots. Edges burn fast, keep uniform thickness."
- "Watch for pale golden edges while baking. Scents change. Nutty aromas should fill the kitchen. Smell toffee hints, cream's texture matters."
- "Checking for doneness can be tricky. Springy, firm touch indicates it’s ready. Look for crackly golden top, a gentle jiggle means it needs more time."
- "Prepare properly. Slice straight through, warm knife under hot water. Wipe it clean between cuts for perfect edges. Cool completely to stop spilling cream."
- "Avoid soggy bases. If cherries are too juicy, layer ground almonds underneath the cream. They absorb extra moisture. Prevents weeping during storage."
