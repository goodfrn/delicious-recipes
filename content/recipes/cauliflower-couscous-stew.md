ingredients:
- "1.4 medium cauliflowers, trimmed and broken into medium florets"
- "4 fresh roma tomatoes"
- "550 ml chicken broth or vegetable broth alternate"
- "12 ml spiced couscous mix"
- "3 ml ground coriander"
- "100 ml diced peeled carrots"
- "90 ml diced peeled turnips"
- "100 ml diced zucchini"
- "60 ml golden raisins"
- "270 ml canned chickpeas, rinsed and drained"
- "25 ml chopped fresh cilantro"
- "Harissa sauce to taste"
- "Salt and pepper as preferred"
instructions:
- "Trim cauliflower stems for separate use. Cut florets roughly then finely chop top of the florets with a knife until small couscous-sized grains form. Set aside chopped cauliflower in bowl."
- "Score an X on bottom of each tomato. Drop into boiling water for 90 seconds, remove and chill under cold water. Peel skins, dice tomatoes, mix with chopped cauliflower."
- "Heat broth with couscous spices and coriander till boiling. Add carrots and turnips. Simmer till tender about 8 minutes. Then stir in zucchini, diced tomatoes, cauliflower grains, raisins, and chickpeas. Return to boil then reduce heat. Cook for 7 minutes stirring occasionally. Season with salt, pepper."
- "Sprinkle chopped cilantro before serving. Offer harissa on side for added spice."
- "Serve warm with grilled chicken or as vegetarian main."
introduction: "Cauliflower chopped tiny instead of grains. Tomatoes peeled, diced, tossed in. Spices hit broth boiling. Veggies drop in, cook soft. Chickpeas add bite, raisins sweet surprise. Harissa for those who want heat. Parsley green bits scattered on top. Goes with grilled meats or salads. No wheat, no dairy, no fuss. Easy adjustments. You can keep stems for puree or cream sauce later. Messy prep but worth every bit. Veggies simmer slowly, smell fills kitchen. Bright colors, simple technique. Serve warm bowls of this veggie mix. Season to your whim. Simple Middle Eastern vibe, not traditional couscous but close enough."
ingredientsNote: "Cauliflower's the star here. Trim stems for soup or puree to reduce waste. Roma tomatoes firm and less watery work better for dicing. You can swap chicken broth with veggie broth to keep it vegan. Couscous spice blends vary in salt and heat, adjust accordingly. Raisins plump, sweet contrast but can swap for chopped apricots if preferred. Chickpeas canned saves time but rinse well to reduce sodium. Parsley fresh chopped at end gives brightness. Harissa adds smoky heat but optional. Zucchini adds mild moistness, can be swapped with eggplant cubes for texture shift."
instructionsNote: "Start by prepping cauliflower carefully until grains appear, using knife for texture not processor. Blanch tomatoes for easier peeling, cooling quickly in cold water. Simmer veggies separately beginning with harder ones like carrots and turnips to ensure tenderness matches others. Add delicate zucchini last to avoid mushiness. Stir gently to mix but keep veggies intact. Raisins should swell in broth for about 5-7 minutes to soften enough without breaking. Taste test broth near end for seasoning and add salt/pepper gradually. Serve with chopped herbs last to keep freshness lively. Harissa served on side lets eaters control spice level. Leftover stems saved for cream soup reduce food waste and adds flavor consistency across dishes."
tips:
- "Use fresh roma tomatoes. They are less watery than others. Helps keep texture. Blanch first for easy peeling. Flavor enhances when dicing. Try not to skip this step."
- "Cut florets down carefully. You want small grains, not mush. Aim for couscous size. A good knife is key. Take your time on this part. It makes all the difference."
- "Simmer harder veggies longer. Carrots, turnips need time. Zucchini goes in last. It cooks faster, avoid mush. Keep veggies intact. Stir gently."
- "Adjust broth for salt content. Taste as you go during cooking. Couscous spice blends vary widely. You might need less or more. Be attentive while seasoning."
- "Leftover cauliflower stems? Use for soups or sauces. No waste, adds flavor. Great way to stretch meals. Saves dollars in cooking too. Be resourceful with every part."
faq:
- "q: Can I use frozen cauliflower? a: Yes, but texture changes. Fresh is crisper. Frozen may become mushy. Keep that in mind when making. Not all brands are equal too."
- "q: What if I don't have harissa? a: You can replace with chili paste. Adds heat too. Or use paprika for milder spice. Experiment based on your preference. Don't skip completely."
- "q: How long does it last in the fridge? a: About three days in airtight container. Reheat gently. Microwaving changes texture. Best enjoyed fresh if possible."
- "q: Can I make this dish vegan? a: Yes, substitute chicken broth for vegetable broth. Simple swap makes it vegan-friendly. Still flavorful with right adjustments. Stay mindful of spices too."
