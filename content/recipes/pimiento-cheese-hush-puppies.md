slug: "pimiento-cheese-hush-puppies"
description: "Deep-fried bites blending coarse yellow cornmeal and gluten-free flour for crunch. Garlic powder swapped in place of garlic salt for subtler heat. Buttermilk swapped with kefir—adds a tangy hit and tender crumb. Cream cheese echoing cheddar's creaminess replaces one of the cheeses. Uses a bit less egg for just enough binding without heaviness. Sweetness pulled from a touch of honey stirred into the batter. A pinch of smoked paprika for subtle warmth. Cooked in avocado oil for its high smoke point and neutral flavor. Fry until crust is deeply golden, crackling audible, and centers soft but cooked through."

ingredients:
- "3 ½ cups avocado oil or peanut oil for frying"
- "1 cup yellow cornmeal coarse grind"
- "½ cup gluten-free all-purpose flour"
- "1 teaspoon garlic powder not garlic salt"
- "½ teaspoon smoked paprika optional but recommended"
- "1 cup kefir or buttermilk substitute"
- "1 large egg beaten lightly"
- "1 cup pimiento cheese with sharp cheddar and cream cheese"
- "1 teaspoon honey or maple syrup"
- "Salt as needed to taste"
instructions:
- "===Heating your oil==="
- "Fill a heavy pot or dutch oven with 3 inches of oil. Use a candy or deep-fry thermometer and heat to 345–350°F. Don’t rush this or the hush puppies will soak oil and get greasy. Test with a little batter drop; should bubble up briskly and set edges instantly."
- "===Mixing the batter==="
- "In a large bowl, whisk cornmeal, gluten-free flour, garlic powder, smoked paprika, and a good pinch of salt. Combine kefir with beaten egg and honey. Pour wet mixture into dry. Stir until just mixed. Add pimiento cheese last, folding gently but thoroughly. Batter should hold shape; too wet? Add a tablespoon more flour. Too dry and crumbly? Splash more kefir or egg. No overmixing — avoid toughness."
- "===Frying and judging doneness==="
- "Oil at temp? Use two spoons or a small cookie scoop to drop heaping tablespoon-sized dollops into oil carefully. Don’t overcrowd. Listen for quick sizzling and bubbling. After about 3 to 4 minutes, gently turn each hush puppy with slotted spoon. Golden crust should form evenly, deep amber—not pale—and the exterior firm but with a slight give when pressed with spoon. Cook another 3 to 4 minutes. Remove when floats freely, crackling audible. Internal temperature around 165°F is safe but trust texture more than thermometer here."
- "Drain on several layers of paper towels or a wire rack set over a sheet pan. The second method avoids steam making them soggy."
- "===Serving and troubleshooting==="
- "Serve warm with a tangy dip like ranch or hot sauce. If hush puppies fall apart, batter was too wet or oil too cool. If dark too early, oil too hot; drop temp. Using gluten-free flour alters texture; expect slightly denser crumb. Crust should snap, interior soft with slight grain from cornmeal."
- "Leftovers reheat best under a low broiler or in a toaster oven to restore crispness. Microwaving makes them rubbery."
introduction: "Hush puppies. Little fried spheres that get taken for granted. In truth, these bite-sized nuggets demand respect. Texture is everything. The outside has to crackle crisply — no limp batter or soggy patches. Inside, a tender crumb that’s moist, hinting at piquant cheese and a whisper of sweetness stacked on a foundation of sturdy cornmeal. Swapped the traditional buttermilk for kefir here. It tucks in a tanginess, sharpens flavor, and keeps crumb tender. Garlic powder instead of garlic salt lets you control salt better; you don’t want bitter edges. Added smoked paprika, a subtle smoke note flipping the flavor whole. Worked with gluten-free flour blend because more cooks face dietary quirks these days. It’s about adapting, adjusting — making it yours. Frying temp, oil choice, batter hydration; all in the details. Yes, timing matters, but more than clocks: watch color, lean on texture, listen to the sizzle and crackle telling you when to flip or pull. Oils with high smoke points keep flavor clean and frying steady. Avocado oil is my pick now. Bring those humble hush puppies from side table afterthought to star of the plate with a little technique and tweaks."
ingredientsNote: "Coarse yellow cornmeal gives grit and chew. Fine cornmeal is a shortcut, but you lose that bite. Gluten-free flour mix replaces regular all-purpose — expect slightly different binding and crispness; watch batter thickness closely. Garlic powder instead of garlic salt avoids uneven salt spots and gives subtle savory pop—you can always finish with salt separately. Smoked paprika optional but adds a subtle smoky undertone without heat. Kefir is a tangier cousin of buttermilk; if unavailable, sour cream thinned with milk can double. Cream cheese folded into the traditional sharp cheddar patches flavor, moisture, and richness. Honey (or maple syrup) sneaks in sweetness without drowning savory notes. Salt is a finishing touch; adjust to your own tolerance because cheese and batters vary in salt already. Oil matters — peanut or avocado oil preferred for smoke points. Vegetable or canola work but may impart slight flavors. Don’t reuse oil more than twice with cheese-based batters; leftover burnt particles spoil taste fast."
instructionsNote: "Oil temperature control is critical — too low and hush puppies soak oil, turning greasy and soft; too hot, they burn on outside leaving raw interiors. Use a thermometer and test with small batter dollops before committing whole batch. Mixing: combine dry ingredients thoroughly before adding wet to avoid clumps. Fold cheese last to avoid overmixing and breaking down cheese too much, which impacts texture. Batter should be thick enough to hold shape when dropped into oil but loose enough to flow slightly — adjust with extra kefir or flour, little by little. Fry in small batches to avoid crowding that drops oil temp. Turning hush puppies halfway keeps crust even. Drain on wire rack to stay crisp, paper towels can trap steam making them floppy. Listen — the hissing and popping quiets right before done. Trust sound and color over exact minutes. Letting hush puppies rest a few minutes post-fry allows interior crumb to set and flavors meld. If batter sticks to spoon or produces gummy bits, wash utensils or dry thoroughly before stirring. Keep oil clean and strain between batches if possible."
tips:
- "Oil temp crucial. Too low? Soggy. Too high? Burned edges. 345-350°F is sweet spot. Use thermometer. Drop test with batter; bubbles should be energetic."
- "Batter should hold shape but not too thick. If too runny, add flour slowly. If dry, splash kefir. Fold cheese carefully at end. Too much mixing breaks it down."
- "Fry in small batches. Don’t overcrowd. It drops oil temp. Listen for that crackle. Tripling? Use deeper pot, keep heat steady. Watch for golden outside."
- "Drain on wire rack not paper towels. Avoid steam ruining crunch. Let them sit few mins after frying. Gives crumb time to set, flavors mix better."
- "Leftovers? Crisp them up under broiler or toaster oven. Microwaving just makes them rubbery and sad. Keep oil clean. Strain between batches."
faq:
- "q: What if hush puppies fall apart? a: Check batter moisture. Too wet; add flour. Oil too cool; it won’t hold shape. Temp control is key."
- "q: Can I substitute kefir? a: Sure. Buttermilk works. Sour cream thinned with milk can also do the job. Just maintain moisture balance in batter."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep in airtight container. Reheat under low heat for best crispiness. Try them in air fryer for quick snack."
- "q: What if they burn on outside? a: Oil too hot. Lower temp next batch. Or could be time in oil too long. Keep checking doneness visually."
