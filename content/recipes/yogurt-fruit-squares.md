description: "Oat and digestive biscuit base baked briefly until golden, topped with a set fruit and yogurt layer thickened with gelatin. Cooling and resting critical for clean cuts. Use berry or tropical purée depending on harvest or freezer stash. Honey swapped for maple syrup for earthiness and better texture binding. Greek yogurt gives richer tang and creaminess. Chill time guides gel set, watch consistency not clock. Double purée batch, one reserved cold for drizzle, adds brightness and contrast. Pick fruit with natural acidity to balance dairy richness. Ideal to prep ahead, saves last-minute stress, store covered to avoid fridge odors mixing."

ingredients:
- "=== Base ==="
- "325 ml (1 1/3 cups) rolled oats"
- "325 ml (1 1/3 cups) digestive biscuit crumbs"
- "60 ml (4 tbsp) unsalted butter, melted"
- "50 ml (3 tbsp + 1 tsp) maple syrup"
- "=== Topping ==="
- "3 envelopes gelatin powder"
- "300 ml (1 1/4 cups) cold water"
- "1.3 litres (5 1/2 cups) fruit purée, fresh or thawed (berries or tropical mix)"
- "175 ml (3/4 cup) granulated sugar"
- "600 ml (2 1/2 cups) Greek yogurt, whole fat"
instructions:
- "=== Base preparation ==="
- "Preheat oven to 175°C (approx 350°F). Combine oats and biscuit crumbs uniformly in large bowl. Melted butter and maple syrup go in next; mix until base sticks together without lumps. Press mixture firmly into a 33 x 23 cm (13 x 9 in) pan lined with parchment. Edge corners and level top with back of spoon. Slide in oven, bake center rack about 15 minutes. Look for light golden color; base should smell nutty and toasted. Remove and cool completely. Avoid overheating or crust crumbles during cutting."
- "=== Fruit gel topping ==="
- "Sprinkle gelatin evenly over cold water. Allow to bloom 5 to 7 minutes until gelatin surface wrinkles and swells. Microwave in 10-second bursts 2-3 times; stir each until fully dissolved. Don't boil or gelatin weakens. Simmer fruit purée with sugar in a microwave-safe bowl or over low heat until sugar dissolves, steaming hot but not boiling. Remove about 600 ml purée, keep chilled to use as pouring sauce later. Combine remaining warm purée with dissolved gelatin quickly, whisking gently but thoroughly. Let cool until only slightly warm to touch. Stir Greek yogurt in at this stage – adding when too hot kills yogurt cultures and affects texture. Mix just enough to blend; overwhipping causes separation."
- "=== Assembly and chill ==="
- "Pour fruit yogurt mix onto cooled base, gently spreading to edges with spatula to avoid layering faults. Cover pan tightly with plastic wrap or lid. Refrigerate minimum 2.5 to 3 hours — look for firm set edges and a slight wobble center that holds shape. Longer chill firms gel more, but avoid drying edges by sealing well. For best cuts, dip knife in hot water, wipe dry before slicing. Clean edges prevent crumb falloff. Serve squares chilled with reserved purée as vibrant drizzle. Store leftovers airtight, keep refrigerated so gel doesn't weep or soften."
introduction: "Starting with a well-bound base is key; oats and digestive biscuits lock together with melted butter and maple syrup for a sturdy but tender platform. No soggy bottoms here. The fruit and yogurt topping holds shape thanks to gelatin, but timing and technique crucial. Too hot a fruit mix kills yogurt creaminess; too cold gelatin fails to incorporate. Texture and flavor hinge on balance; choose fresh ripe berries or tropical purées for natural acidity that cuts the dairy richness. Making the purée sauce ahead lets you finish with punchy brightness. Chill for hours, but slice following these tricks to avoid collapse and crumbling crumbs. Layering flavors and textures simple but requires discipline and patience. Refrigerate covered to maintain freshness and gel integrity. Works with seasonal fruits or frozen stored wisely, no waste."
ingredientsNote: "Oats can be rolled or quick-cooking but stick to rolled for proper texture and structural integrity. Digestive biscuits replaced graham crumbs as they’re more readily available and add hearty malt flavor; both give a firm, buttery crust essential to hold the yogurt topping. Butter amount increased slightly for cohesion; maple syrup substituted honey to deepen flavor and aid in moisture retention, preventing the base from drying excessively. Greek yogurt uplifts creaminess and tang, enriching mouthfeel. Gelatin must be hydrated well before dissolving; microwave bursts prevent overheating which deactivates setting power. Fruit purée flexible: fresh ripe berries, mango or passion fruit blends add natural pectin and acid to firm gel. Sugar quantity balanced to round tartness without overpowering natural fruit notes. Always reserve half purée as cold sauce for plating contrast. Use parchment for easy release and clean edges."
instructionsNote: "Start with base prep, pressing mixture firmly into a parchment-lined pan to ensure even thickness and consistent baking. Oven hot and baked until just golden; overheating yields crumbly dry base hard to slice clean. Cooling fully prevents mixing layers during topping stage. Bloom gelatin correctly for maximum gel strength; following the swell and slight puckering is your visual cue. Dissolving in short microwave intervals preserves integrity. Combine warm fruit purée with gelatin quickly, then cool to lukewarm before yogurt addition - avoid curdling and split texture. Uniform spreading atop base without disturbing crust layers critical. Cover tightly to avoid gel forming thick skin. Chill at least 2.5 hours; final gel will wobble but hold shape when moved—indicator ready to slice. Dip and clean knife between cuts for neat squares. Serve with reserved purée chilled or lightly warmed. Problems: too hot gelatin mix curdles; too cold leaves unmixed lumps. If base soggy, increase butter slightly or bake longer. Fruit acidity varies; adjust sugar accordingly to balance tartness."
tips:
- "Press base firmly into pan. Key to avoid crumbles. Layer even thickness. Bake until lightly golden. Smell nutty aroma, drop in temp before cooling."
- "Gelatin needs hydration. Bloom correctly, see wrinkles on surface. Use microwave for short bursts. Too hot kills texture. Lukewarm yogurt adds creaminess."
- "Reserve part of fruit puree, chill for drizzle. Contrast helps cut richness. Use ripe fruits, natural acidity balances yogurt. Fresh gives more flavor."
- "Chill at least two and half hours. Watch for wobble, firms at edges. Avoid overbaking crust. Soggy base? More butter or longer bake."
- "Knife dipped in hot water gives clean cuts. Clean between slices; crumb control prevents mess. Cover tightly while chilling. Prevents skin on gel."
faq:
- "q: How can I adjust texture? a: Start with base that’s too soft; more oats or biscuits next time. Balance dry and wet ingredients well."
- "q: Alternatives for fruit puree? a: Can use applesauce, fruit smoothies. Adjust sugar; different sweetness levels. Adjust gelatins as fruit less acidic."
- "q: My squares crumbled while cutting? a: Did you let cool completely? Serve chilled. Too soft, didn’t press base firmly enough."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Airtight container for sure. Refrigerate. Use parchment at bottom. Keeps texture; no moisture loss or drying."
