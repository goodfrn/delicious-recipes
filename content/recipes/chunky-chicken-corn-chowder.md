description: "A creamy, cheesy corn chowder spiked with diced green chiles and smoky paprika. Uses cream cheese and gouda for a less processed, richer flavor. Combines shredded chicken, sweet corn, fire-roasted diced tomatoes, and a touch of smoked paprika for depth. Thickened with evaporated milk instead of canned cream soup. Salt and pepper adjusted to taste. Corn cooks in simmering broth, releasing natural sweetness. Warm, soothing. Texture contrast from creamy base and tender corn kernels. Easy midweek dish. Leftovers taste better next day. Avoid overboiling cheese to prevent grainy texture."

ingredients:
- "6 cups chicken stock or broth"
- "8 oz cream cheese cubed"
- "6 oz shredded gouda cheese"
- "1 can diced fire-roasted tomatoes with green chiles 10 oz"
- "1 1/4 cups evaporated milk"
- "2 cups cooked shredded chicken"
- "2 cups frozen corn kernels"
- "1 tsp smoked paprika"
- "1/2 tsp garlic powder"
- "1/2 tsp onion powder"
- "1 tsp kosher salt plus more"
- "1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Heat stock in large heavy-bottom pot over medium until steaming and just coming to boil. Bubbling small and steady, no rolling boil to avoid evaporating liquid or scorching cheese later."
- "Reduce heat to low. Drop in cream cheese cubes and shredded gouda gradually. Stir gently but persistently with a silicone spatula to coax smooth melting without clumps or burning. Watch closely; cheese melts faster when stock is hot but gentle heat prevents graininess."
- "Add diced fire-roasted tomatoes with chilies plus evaporated milk. Stir well. The milk adds creaminess and thickens without canned soups. The tomatoes give smoky tang and subtle heat, swapping out the original tomato-spinach mix. Add smoked paprika now for warmth and depth. Blend spices next: garlic powder, onion powder, plus the first 1 tsp kosher salt. Stir to integrate evenly."
- "Bring mixture to a gentle simmer. You’ll see micro-bubbles along sides of pot; this signals gentle cooking, avoids breaking the dairy proteins. This preserves creamy mouthfeel. Once simmering, add shredded cooked chicken and frozen corn kernels directly. No need to thaw corn; it cooks quickly in broth’s heat, releasing sweetness."
- "Keep at gentle simmer, stir occasionally so corn cooks evenly and heat distributes through chicken. About 6-7 minutes here, until corn is tender but still has a slight pop when bitten. Taste broth; adjust salt and pepper now. Pepper brings brightness and subtle heat to balance creaminess."
- "If chowder is too thick, add small splashes of stock or water. Too thin? Simmer uncovered briefly until desired consistency—stir so solids don’t stick."
- "Serve hot, preferably ladled into warmed bowls to keep temperature consistent. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley or chives if desired."
- "Leftovers reheat well on stovetop over low heat with occasional stirring. Add splash of stock if thickened overnight."
- "Substitution tips: use Havarti or Monterey Jack instead of gouda for milder profile. Swapping canned diced tomatoes with mild diced green chiles keeps heat but cuts acidity. For dairy-free, skip cheeses and replace evaporated milk with full-fat coconut milk—flavor will shift but yields creamy base. Cook corn kernels longer until tender if fresh."
introduction: "Cheesy corn chowder with a twist. Skip the Velveeta and canned cream soups—they’re fine in a pinch but the texture suffers if overheated. Instead, layer flavors with cream cheese and gouda, giving that rich melt without the chalky finish. Add diced fire-roasted tomatoes with green chiles. Not just flavor; they bring subtle heat and brightness instead of watery chunks. Evaporated milk smooths the broth, minus the gelatinous canned soup vibe. The corn cooks right in, seasonings built slow and steady. You get cozy warmth, a meal that’s both hearty and clean. Chicken and corn is classic—here it’s about clean techniques and knowing when it’s done by look and taste, not by timer."
ingredientsNote: "Chicken stock or broth forms the base. Use homemade or low-sodium store-bought to control salt early on. Cream cheese cubes melt smoothly over low heat but can clump if rushed. Gouda adds nutty, creamy depth; Havarti or Monterey Jack work if you need to switch. Sub out canned diced fire-roasted tomatoes with standard diced tomatoes plus a teaspoon of chipotle for smoky punch if unavailable. Evaporated milk is a key thickener, offering silkiness different from heavy cream or canned soups. Frozen corn is standard—fresh corn cuts seasonality but requires proper cutting and blanching. Spices—paprika, garlic, onion powders—layer complexity. Salt only added after cheese melts; cheese has inherent salt that can throw off early seasoning."
instructionsNote: "Start by bringing broth to just-under-boil. Boiling can cause cheese to seize or separate. Then lower heat; melting cheeses here requires patience and slow stirring. Watch cheese carefully—if you see oily spots or graininess, temperature was too high. Add tomatoes and evaporated milk next for flavor integration and viscosity; the milk also helps stabilize cheese proteins. Spices added at this stage bloom in liquid heat, not before. Return mixture to gentle simmer, visible as small bubbles percolating on pot edges, not a rolling boil. Add cold chicken and frozen corn without thawing—the residual heat finishes cooking without drying out protein or softening corn too mushy. Stir to distribute heat evenly. Remove from heat after corn softens with a slight bite. Season final with salt and pepper by taste—important because cheese and stock saltiness vary batch to batch. Store leftovers covered in fridge, reheat gently avoiding boiling."
tips:
- "Start with low sodium chicken broth. Control salt levels easily. Homemade broth? Perfect! Heat slowly, avoid boiling. Cheese loves gentleness."
- "Don't rush melting cheese. High heat, clumps. Watch for smoothness. Stir patiently. Cream cheese, gouda blend well if treated kindly."
- "Want texture? Corn adds sweetness. Use frozen, no thawing. Fresh? Needs cutting and blanching. Avoid mushy corn. Bite required."
- "Adjust final seasoning carefully. Salt varies by brand and cheese used. Test broth before serving. Pepper brightens flavors. Don’t oversalt."
- "Store leftovers well. Use airtight containers. Fridge good up to 3 days, stir when reheating. Add splash stock if too thick."
faq:
- "q: What if the cheese separates? a: Low heat helps. If already grainy, stir hard and add a splash of milk. Sometimes, start over."
- "q: Can I use a different cheese? a: Yes! Havarti or Monterey Jack for milder flavor. Each cheese gives a different texture. Experiment!"
- "q: Corn too soft? a: Check cooking times. Undercook slightly. Simmer longer if needed, fresh takes more time. Keep that pop!"
- "q: Can I freeze leftovers? a: Yes, but texture changes for dairy. Reheat slow on stovetop. Add stock to adjust consistency"
