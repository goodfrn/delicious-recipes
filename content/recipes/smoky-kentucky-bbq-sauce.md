ingredients:
- "1 medium onion finely chopped"
- "50 ml unsalted butter"
- "2 cloves garlic minced"
- "20 ml smoked paprika"
- "60 ml aged rum"
- "50 ml honey"
- "45 ml apple cider vinegar"
- "125 ml ketchup"
- "230 ml tomato sauce"
- "5 ml chipotle hot sauce or to taste"
- "Salt and black pepper"
instructions:
- "Start by softening onion in butter over medium heat. Sprinkle salt and pepper as it cooks."
- "Add minced garlic and smoked paprika. Stir 1-2 minutes until fragrant but not burnt."
- "Pour in the aged rum. Let bubble briefly, scraping up browned bits from the pan bottom."
- "Add honey, apple cider vinegar, ketchup, and tomato sauce. Stir well to combine all."
- "Bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat and let simmer uncovered 25-30 minutes. Stir every few minutes to prevent sticking."
- "Sauce should thicken and become sticky. Taste, adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, or chipotle hot sauce."
- "Optional: Blend sauce until smooth using an immersion blender or regular blender for creamy texture."
- "Cool slightly. Serve warm with grilled pork, ribs, or spread on burgers."
introduction: "Onions and garlic sizzle in butter, aromas fill the air fast. Paprika dusted in, smoky and deep. Rum replaces bourbon — aged, dark, adding depth. Honey swaps out molasses, lighter, mellow sweet. Apple cider vinegar instead of lemon juice, tart and bright but less sharp. Tomato bases unite ketchup and sauce for rich texture. Heat from chipotle hot sauce, smoky fire licking. Sauce slowly thickens on stove, patience key. Perfect messy ribs companion or slather with burgers packed full of pork. Smooth or chunky, up to taste. Play with spice, add liquid smoke or extra tang. BBQ scent in kitchen is promise enough."
ingredientsNote: "Butter softens onions, builds base. Smoked paprika adds warmth and a subtle earthiness. Rum brings nuanced flavor, replacing bourbon's sharper edge. Honey lightens sweet profile compared to molasses, making sauce less heavy but still sweet enough to balance acidity. Apple cider vinegar gives brightness replacing lemon juice’s citrus punch, creating layered acidity. Tomato sauce and ketchup for body and richness; yogurt-thick texture. Chipotle hot sauce adds smoky heat and spice kick, adjustable for preference. Salt and pepper essential to balance flavors, seasoning through cooking or at end. Fresh garlic builds savory notes, keep minced small for even cooking and release of aroma. Quantities scaled down by roughly 30% for a smaller batch. Swap two ingredients for flavor variation. A bourbon swap for rum softens alcoholic pungency; molasses swapped to honey offers lighter sweetness; lemon juice switched for apple cider vinegar adds mellow tartness."
instructionsNote: "Start by sweating onions in butter until translucent, giving base richness. Salt and pepper early to extract moisture and build flavor. Add garlic and smoked paprika next, cook briefly so paprika doesn’t burn and garlic softens releasing aroma. Deglaze pan with rum to capture all browned bits and deepen flavor profile. Stir in honey, vinegar, ketchup, and tomato sauce, bring all flavors into marriage. Simmer uncovered to thicken, stirring frequently so sauce doesn’t stick or scorch on bottom. Timing extended slightly compared to original, 25-30 minutes for richer thickness. Taste often, tweak heat or seasoning before serving. Purée sauce if smooth consistency preferred, blending intensifies color and smoothness. Serve warm after slight cooling. Great on pork ribs, grilled filets, or burgers. Sauce holds well refrigerated and reheats without losing texture."
tips:
- "Start by using quality ingredients. Fresh onions bring flavor. Smoked paprika is essential. Vary your honey. Use darker honey for more depth. Adjust spices to your palate's like, chipotle heat easy to control. Want more smoke? Add that drop of liquid smoke. Be careful though. Too much can overwhelm."
- "When cooking onions, patience. Softening is key. Medium heat, gentle and slow. Garlic must be minced very fine. Releases aroma better, flavors unite well. For rum, let it bubble. Scrape the pan bottom. Captures all flavor. Simmer uncovered. Stir frequently, prevent sticking. Time it right."
- "Taste as you go. Adjust flavors. More vinegar for tang? Extra honey for sweetness? Chipotle can be tricky, try a little, then more. Texture matters. Blend it for smooth or leave chunky. Personal choice. Make it your own. Keep experimenting with that balance."
- "Storage matters. Use airtight containers. Sauce keeps for five days. Great to batch and save. Reheat gently. Keeps taste without losing texture. Use for other meats, chicken, or grilled veggies. Versatile sauce adjusts to many dishes. Consider freezing if not using fast."
- "Final tip on serving. Let the sauce sit a bit before serving. It deepens flavors. Perfect with ribs or burgers. Don't be shy to slather it on. Grilled meats really absorb it. Adds flavor punch. Keep some on hand for your next cookout."
