slug: "holiday-turkey-roast"
description: "A brined and stuffed turkey roast with a fruit-infused pork filling and robust fortified wine sauce. The main protein is lightly brined to retain moisture, then opened flat, spread with a mixed sweet-savory farce, rolled, tied, and roasted until the internal temperature hits the safe threshold. The cooking juices form the base of a thickened pan sauce elevated with aromatics and fortified wine. Ideal for holiday tables where turkey needs a fresh twist. Serve with classic sides like mashed potatoes or green beans to balance the rich flavors."

- "1 small onion, finely diced"
- "1 garlic clove, minced"
- "25 g (1/4 cup) fresh or frozen cranberries"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) unsalted butter"
- "115 g (1/4 lb) ground pork, lean"
- "1 small apple, cored and finely chopped"

- "60 ml (1/4 cup) chicken stock"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) panko breadcrumbs"
- "1 generous pinch ground cinnamon"
- "=== Pan Sauce ==="
- "2 garlic cloves, minced"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) all-purpose flour"
- "500 ml (2 cups) chicken broth"
- "60 ml (1/4 cup) fortified wine (port, sherry, or marsala)"
instructions:
- "=== Brine Preparation ==="
- "Bring 500 ml water, salt, and brown sugar to rapid boil in a large pot, stirring constantly until dissolved. Remove from heat. Add peppercorns, bay leaves, and remaining water (2.5 liters). Pour into container large enough for roast. Submerge turkey roast completely, weigh down with a plate if needed. Refrigerate 10–14 hours (overnight)."
- "=== Stuffing Preparation ==="
- "Melt half the butter (15 ml) in a skillet over medium. Add onion, garlic, and cranberries. Cook until cranberries burst, about 4 minutes. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl."
- "In the same pan, add remaining butter, brown pork, season with salt and pepper. When pork begins to caramelize, stir in apple pieces and cook 2 minutes. Pour in fortified wine and chicken stock, simmer gently until almost dry, about 5 minutes. Off heat, stir in breadcrumbs and cinnamon. Check seasoning. Combine with cranberry mixture. Refrigerate 20–30 minutes to meld flavors and thicken."
- "=== Turkey Assembly and Cooking ==="
- "Preheat oven to 190°C (375°F). Rack at lowest level. Remove turkey from brine, pat dry very well with paper towels. Lay open flat, skin-side down. Spread stuffing evenly over center section. Fold back roast, enclosing stuffing. Thread kitchen twine beneath roast, tie snugly, trim excess string."
- "Brush roast lightly with oil or softened butter, place in shallow roasting pan. Bake uncovered about 1 hour 25–35 minutes or until internal temperature in center of stuffing reaches 74°C (165°F). Add a splash water to pan if drippings scorch. Once done, remove from oven and transfer roast to board. Tent loosely with foil, rest 15 minutes while preparing sauce."
- "=== Sauce Preparation ==="
- "In same roasting pan or separate skillet over medium heat, add diced garlic cloves. Sprinkle flour evenly, stirring to form roux with pan juices. Gradually whisk in chicken broth, fortified wine, and reserved pan drippings. Bring to steady boil, whisk constantly to prevent lumps. Simmer vigorously 10 minutes until thickened, deepened in color. Taste, adjust salt and pepper. Optional: strain sauce through fine sieve for smooth consistency."
- "=== To Serve ==="
- "Cut twine, slice roast thickly against grain. Arrange on warmed platter, drizzle sauce over or serve alongside. Classic mashed potatoes and steamed green beans provide balance. Sauce is rich—resting roast critical to seal juices."
- "=== Notes and Tips ==="
- "If turkey roast unavailable, substitute boneless turkey breast. Reduce brining time by half if under 1.5 kg. Apple replaces original pear for different aroma but keep firm to avoid mushy texture. Cinnamon swap for nutmeg adds warmth and uniqueness. Avoid soaking farce excessively; it should hold shape when closed. Monitoring temperature with digital probe key—guessing robs moisture. Sauce benefits from deglazing pan thoroughly—scraping fond releases essential flavor. Store leftovers sealed tightly, use within 3 days or freeze."
- "If no fortified wine on hand, substitute extra chicken stock with splash of apple cider vinegar or balsamic to maintain tang. Cranberries fresh or frozen work equally; count on them softening but keep audible pop to avoid grim texture."
- "Smoke or grill the pork ahead for added depth if time allows, rest assured cooking times may increase slightly."
- "Do not skip brining, particularly if roast is skinless; moisture retention is crucial here. Pat dry thoroughly before roasting to encourage a well-browned crust."
- "Keep an eye on roasting pan liquids to prevent burning; add small amounts of water or broth mid-roast if juices evaporate. Using a rimmed sheet pan with rack works if no roasting pan available—place foil-lined tray underneath to catch drippings."
introduction: "Forget dry turkey disasters. Instead, brining locks in moisture while balancing salt and sweetness. The fruit-studded stuffing is a twist — apples swap pears, cinnamon leans warm, richer than nutmeg. Ground pork mingles with tart cranberries and silky butter. The joint gets opened flat — no lump roasting. Flat means even cooking, stuffing spread thin. Roll it tight, tie it like a package. Roast till thermometer says safe and juices run clear. Pan sauce ties everything—aromatic garlic and more of that fortified wine simmered to silky perfection. No guesswork, just practical, tactile cues for crisp skin and juicy meat. Side of mashed spuds? Mandatory."
ingredientsNote: "Brining is an underrated step — salt and sugar create osmotic magic to plump the meat, especially if skinless. Swap kosher salt for sea salt if needed; adjust quantities slightly to taste. Brown sugar replaced with maple syrup for subtle earthiness works but monitor caramelization. Fortified wine adds aromatic depth—port, marsala, or sherry, whichever grabs your fancy. Apples instead of pears for twist, but avoid mushy ones. Breadcrumbs should be fresh or panko for structure. Can swap pork for turkey sausage if preferred. Butter crucial for sautéing, adds smoothness; olive oil changes flavor profile significantly. Cranberries frozen? No worries. Just thaw a bit to avoid ice water diluting the stuffing."
instructionsNote: "Start with brine cold, always cool before adding meat—hot liquid cooks edges prematurely. Brining overnight minimum; shorter times mean less benefit but still better than dry. Dry meat thoroughly to help brown. When sautéing stuffing, look for color and popping fruit as sign it’s ready; don’t rush or raw onion will spoil taste. Reducing liquids in stuffing step concentrates flavor and gives binding power. Roll turkey carefully; if loose, stuffing leaks, skin tears, loss of moisture. Use kitchen twine methodical—tied too loose and stuffing falls apart, too tight and meat tears or cooks unevenly. Use instant-read thermometer, insert in thickest part of stuffing, not meat. Rest roast tented loosely to allow juices to redistribute without steaming the skin."
tips:
- "Brining's key. Salt and sugar create magic. Osmosis plumps turkey. Skinless roasts—brining's critical. Can't skip it. Adjust salt accordingly."
- "Use digital thermometer. Insert in thickest part of stuffing. Not meat. Avoid guessing. Safe temp is 74°C. Temperature rises post-roasting."
- "For stuffing—don’t rush sautéing. Onions should be translucent, cranberries bursting. Flavor develops with slow cooking. Dry stuffing isn’t a win."
- "If turkey roast's hard to find, use boneless breast. Cut brining time in half. Don't over-soak stuffing. It needs to hold shape."
- "Resting’s non-negotiable. Cuts like a dream after resting. Let juices redistribute. Tent loosely with foil. Too hot means steam, soggy skin."
faq:
- "q: How long to brine? a: Overnight is best. Shorter means less flavor, but still better than none. Keep it cold. Always."
- "q: Can I use frozen cranberries? a: Yes, just thaw them. No excess water. Texture matters. They should burst when cooked."
- "q: What if stuffing leaks? a: Roll tight. Avoid loose ends. Use twine correctly. Wet stuffing—rethink moisture balance."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Wrap tightly. Use within three days. Or freeze portions. Use vacuum seal if available."
