ingredients:
- "480 g beef shoulder roast boneless, cut into cubes"
- "180 g pitted dried prunes"
- "15 g fresh chopped cilantro, plus extra for garnish"
- "3 medium carrots cut into 2 cm chunks"
- "1 red bell pepper, seeded and diced"
- "1 bag (200 g) sliced leeks"
- "1 can (400 ml) chickpeas, rinsed and drained"
- "400 ml beef broth"
- "45 ml tomato paste"
- "25 ml curry powder"
- "3 ml ground cinnamon"
- "3 ml harissa paste"
- "2 medium zucchinis, diced"
instructions:
- "Combine beef cubes, prunes, carrots, red pepper, leeks, and chickpeas in slow cooker. Add beef broth and tomato paste. Stir in curry powder, cinnamon, and harissa paste. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cover."
- "Cook on low heat for about 8 hours and 30 minutes. Avoid opening lid during cooking to keep heat."
- "After cooking time, stir in diced zucchinis. Cover again and let sit 15 minutes to soften the zucchini gently."
- "Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro before serving."
- "Serve with couscous or crusty bread if desired."
introduction: "Beef chunks and prunes mix. Sweet meets savory. Carrots and red peppers add color, leeks bring subtle onion flavor. Chickpeas fill out the texture. Curry powder with a pinch of cinnamon spices it up. Harissa adds fire but not too much. Tomato paste and beef broth make the base rich. Cook low and slow, patience pays off. Last, zucchini cubes go in to avoid mush, hold shape but soften just right. Fresh cilantro drops over top at the end. Try with couscous or bread. Simple slow cooker magic. No fuss. Long cook. Big flavors."
ingredientsNote: "Reduced beef from 675 g to 480 g saves some calories but keeps hearty pieces. Increased prunes to 180 g to boost sweetness and soften the stew profile. Switched leeks from 250 g to 200 g for better balance. Chickpeas from 540 ml can to 400 ml can, less liquid but still enough texture. Reduced beef broth from 500 ml to 400 ml to keep sauce thicker. Tomato paste lowered slightly to 45 ml. Curry powder bumped from 30 ml to 25 ml—slight adjustment for taste balance considering cooking time change. Cinnamon down from 5 ml to 3 ml, harissa down slightly for milder heat. Added fresh cilantro stays the same. Zucchini quantity unchanged."
instructionsNote: "Mix all but zucchini in crockpot, stew on low for 8.5 hours, a little less than before. This retains tenderness but avoids drying. Opening lid kept minimal to trap steam. Zucchini added last, then left covered for 15 minutes to avoid turning to mush, keeps some bite. Seasoning adjusted after cooking to taste. Garnish fresh cilantro last minute to keep flavor vibrant. Optionally serve with couscous or fresh rustic bread to soak up sauce."
tips:
- "Cubes of beef shoulder important cut for stew beef. Helps maintain moisture. Browning gives depth. Sear before slow cooking. Enhances flavor. Cut chunks uniform for even cooking. Avoid sizes too big or small. Think about tenderness."
- "Fresh chopped cilantro brightens up stew at the end. Flavors pot very well. Don’t skip. Zucchini added last minute for best texture. Avoid mushy. Keep the zucchini cubes decent size. Small is risky. Let them sit after cooking."
- "Check seasoning before serving. Always adjust. Salt changes taste greatly. Adding freshly ground black pepper just before serving brings warmth. Consider more curry or harissa if heat needed. Spice levels are personal. Tweak to fit taste. Think layers of flavors."
- "Couscous or crusty bread can be paired. Stew has rich sauce. Perfect for soaking. Serving options enhance meal experience. Nutrition varies based on sides. Adjust ingredients if calories are concern. Check pantry before starting too."
- "Slow cooking stews requires patience. Let flavors meld. Opening lid loses heat. Minimum checks help keep moisture. If short on time, cooking at high temp for less time is possible. But texture may suffer. Low and slow is the key."
faq:
- "q: How to store leftover beef stew a: Refrigerate within two hours. Airtight container best. Cooled to room temp first. Should last in fridge three to four days. Can freeze portions too. Thaw in fridge overnight."
- "q: What can I use instead of chickpeas a: Any beans works. Kidney or navy beans are options. Lentils are great too. Adjust cooking time if using lentils. They cook faster. Keep texture in mind. Don’t overcook."
- "q: Is there a way to thicken stew a: If too runny, mix cornstarch with cold water. Stir while boiling. Or mash some beans. Helps thicken without altering taste. Can add flour too. Stir at end to thicken."
- "q: Can I make this ahead of time a: Yes, stew improves flavor. Make a day prior. Refrigerate overnight. Flavors deepen. Reheat gently. Stovetop or microwave. Don’t boil too strong. Avoid overcooking textures."
