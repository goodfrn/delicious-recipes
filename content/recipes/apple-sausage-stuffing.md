ingredients:
- "140 g bacon diced"
- "1 medium onion chopped"
- "1 stalk celery thinly sliced"
- "2 cloves garlic minced"
- "2 Granny Smith apples peeled diced"
- "280 ml low sodium chicken stock"
- "680 ml leftover sourdough bread cubes"
- "420 g ground pork sausage"
- "12 ml wholegrain mustard"
- "2 ml ground cinnamon"
- "1 large egg"
- "Salt and black pepper freshly ground"
instructions:
- "Set oven rack center and preheat to 175 C (350 F)."
- "Render bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until fat melts and edges crisp. Toss in onion and celery snippets stirring. Wait until onion softens, translucent, and celery wilts but keeps slight crunch."
- "Stir in minced garlic, then diced tart apples. Cook 1-2 minutes, just enough for garlic aroma to rise and apples to start softening. Salt and pepper here; brings layers out."
- "Pour chicken stock to deglaze—listen for the hiss and watch browned bits loosen. Simmer briskly till liquid evaporates, a sticky film clinging on bottom says stop."
- "Transfer everything warm into a big bowl. Add cubes of dry sourdough bread — same day bread usable but latency important. It soaks up flavour without turning mushy."
- "Add ground sausage, mustard, cinnamon, and egg. Mix with your hands or big spoon until fully combined. Squeeze gently to check stuffing is moist but holds shape without dripping wet. Adjust with bread or stock if needed."
- "Taste for salt and pepper at this point—sausage seasoning varies widely. Be bold, remember oven dulls seasoning slightly."
- "Spread mixture evenly in a 28 x 20 cm baking dish. Pat down lightly no overpacking. Surface level and even without gaps allows heat to penetrate uniformly."
- "Bake about 40 minutes or until top golden brown and juices bubble at edges. Internal temperature for pork 70 C is safe, but texture cues better here."
- "For final touch turn broiler on high. Brown surface under broil 2-4 minutes until crust crisp and browned spots appear—watch carefully here, easy to burn."
- "Remove and let sit 5 minutes before serving so juices settle."
- "Serve alongside roasted turkey or chicken. A side drizzle of apple jus adds brightness and ties flavours."
introduction: "Stale bread, sausage, apples. A combo that feels old-school but holds up because textures play off each other. Tender pork and crispy bacon fat knit into sourdough's chewy crumb. Mustard and cinnamon make you pause—sweet, savory, earthy. Scent in kitchen shifts mid-cook: from smoky bacon to warm fruit. No overthinking. Watch color changes, smell deepening, moisture balance rather than clock staring. Allergy-friendly, no nuts here. Easy swaps for apple or sausage type noted. Tackles hallmark problems: soggy stuffing, bland edges, undercooked meat. Real kitchen lessons back it all up — these are the signs that tell, not timers."
ingredientsNote: "Use sold slab bacon over pre-cut for better fat control. Bacon renders fat, a flavor and moisture lifter. If unavailable, pancetta or thick-cut ham works fine but adjust salt. Granny Smith recommended for tartness and firmness; soften slower so stuffing holds texture. Other firm apples like Braeburn fine, avoid overly sweet or soft types like Fuji — they turn pulpy. Stale sourdough ideal for crumb texture that absorbs without dissolving; day-old bakery bread usually okay but if fresh loaf then dry cubes in 120 C oven 10-15 minutes. Chicken stock—low sodium or homemade—adds depth over water. Ground pork sausage traditional; substitute with spicy Italian sausage or even turkey sausage but expect flavor shift. Mustard and cinnamon small but necessary; mustard seeds release oils, cinnamon adds gentle warmth but avoid over spicing. Egg binds without weighing down. Salt and pepper crucial given sausage variance. Adjust seasoning after mixing but before baking."
instructionsNote: "Render bacon slowly, patience yields crispiest lardons and a clean fat pool for sauté. Onion and celery need translucence, not browned, to keep balance—browning brings bitterness here. Garlic and apple added late to preserve freshness and to avoid garlic burning and apple falling apart; short coddling just until softened. Deglaze with hot stock to pick up that fond—that golden stickiness is flavor gold. Evaporate liquid thoroughly so mix is moist, not wet; excess liquid leads to soggy stuffing. Mix well but do not overwork sausage; overmixing tightens texture. Spread loosely so heat penetrates evenly; dense packing=wet interior, dried edges. Bake in middle rack for even heat distribution. Oven temperature slightly reduced here to avoid burning edges before interior cooks. Jiggly edges, bubbling juices, and a golden top are your doneness signals. Final broil step creates appealing crust but needs watchful eye—seconds count. Resting is underrated; juices redistribute restoring moisture balance inside bite. Last tip: if stuffing looks dry mid-bake, splash extra stock around edges but avoid puddling on top."
tips:
- "Use slab bacon for best fat control; renders down nicely. Watch it crisp but don’t rush—slow is key. Pancetta or thick ham can sub in—adjust salt."
- "Granny Smith brings tartness, firm texture; other firm apples work. Avoid soft kinds. If using fresh bread, dry cubes in low oven until hard."
- "Taste for spices early on; sausage seasoning varies widely. Be bold with salt and pepper. Adjust before baking—oven dulls flavors slightly."
- "Mix the stuffing gently; don’t overwork sausage. Loose mix means even cooking. Dense stuffing leads to soggy inside. Spread evenly in baking dish."
- "Final broil creates crispy top; stay vigilant. Seconds count. If stuffing looks dry mid-bake, splash stock around edges. Avoid puddles."
faq:
- "q: How long to bake? a: About 40 minutes. Look for golden brown top, bubbling juices. Internal temp for pork at 70 C works."
- "q: Can I use other meats? a: Sure, spicy Italian adds depth. Turkey sausage is lighter but expect flavor shift. Adjust seasoning as needed."
- "q: What if it turns soggy? a: Ensure liquid evaporates before mixing. Excess stock leads to sogginess; adjust bread amount if too wet."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep in airtight container. Refrigerate up to 3 days. Reheat in oven; splash with stock if too dry."
