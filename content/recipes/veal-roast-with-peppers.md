ingredients:
- "900 g tied boneless veal round or shoulder roast, trimmed"
- "10 fresh sage leaves"
- "40 ml olive oil (3 c. tbsp)"
- "1 large lemon, zest peeled thin with peeler"
- "2 cloves garlic, skin on, lightly crushed"
- "12 ml whole wheat or all-purpose flour (2½ tsp)"
- "450 ml vegetable broth or chicken broth (1¾ cups)"
- "20 ml fresh lemon juice (1¼ tbsp)"
- "Salt and cracked black pepper"
- "3 bell peppers, assorted colors, seeded and julienned"
- "3 small shallots, finely sliced"
- "45 ml olive oil (3 tbsp)"
- "400 g cherry tomatoes halved"
- "15 ml chopped fresh parsley"
- "1 small red chili pepper, deseeded, finely chopped (twist)"
- "10 ml balsamic vinegar (2 tsp) (substitutes for lemon juice in sauce or extra acidity)"
instructions:
- "=== Veal Preparation ==="
- "Preheat oven at 190 C (375 F), rack in middle. Remove thick white membrane if visible on veal for tenderness; insert 7-8 sage leaves under the twine at the edges for infused herbal burst during roast. Salt and pepper generously all over. Heat 30 ml olive oil in heavy ovenproof pan or cast iron until shimmering but not smoking. Lay meat down; pound sizzle, golden crust, about 3–4 min per side turning all round for even caramelization. Toss in lemon zest shreds and garlic cloves. Transfer pan directly to oven. Check at 27 minutes mark; poke gently with thermometer—aim 54 C (130 F) for medium rare, meat springs under finger, juices clear pink, not bloody. Remove, cover loosely tented with foil. Rest for 12 minutes minimum. Temp creeps to perfect 58 C without drying out. Rest crucial to keep juices inside, ensures every slice tender, less drip on plate."
- "=== Sauce and Pan Deglaze ==="
- "Return pan to stovetop over medium heat. Sprinkle flour evenly, stirring briskly to cook raw taste off — watch no lumps form. After 1 minute, slowly whisk in broth and 15 ml lemon juice along with remaining sage torn roughly. Scrape browned bits stuck to bottom, that’s flavor gold. Simmer sauce, bubble medium, reduce by half or until slightly thickened coating spoon back. If too thick, add splash broth; too thin, let reduce but keep stirring or it sticks. Strain off sage leaves (they can taste bitter if oversteeped). Season last pinch salt, cracked pepper. Option: try swapping lemon juice with 2 tsp balsamic vinegar for deeper savory note if lacking brightness."
- "=== Vegetables ==="
- "While veal roasts, heat 45 ml olive oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add sliced shallots and peppers. Stir often, listen for soft shushing sound not burning. Cook until pieces just tender, 8–10 minutes. Color intensifies, peppers shrink but still hold shape, slightly glossy edges. Toss in chopped chili for subtle heat kick. Add cherry tomatoes and parsley. Cook 2 minutes more until tomatoes burst lightly, release juice, stir well, add reserved lemon juice or more balsamic, some coarse salt to amplify flavors. Remove from heat promptly, avoid mushy mess."
- "=== Serving ==="
- "Slice veal crosswise on bias, about 1 cm thick, juicy pink center with tender crust. Plate with pepper mixture steaming beside it. Drizzle warm pan sauce over slices not drowning, just enough to shine. Garnish with extra fresh parsley or lemon zest if desired. Companion starch: roasted fingerling potatoes or crusty bread. If veal gets too hot, rest longer or slice thinner. Sauce texture depends on flour stirring technique; no lumps, no gritty flour taste by cooking before adding liquids. Simple tweaks: swap red chili for smoked paprika for smoky aromatic flair with no heat."
- "=== Tips ==="
- "Don’t skip resting. Use instant-read thermometer; guesswork ruins texture. Pan must be hot enough initially for crust but not smoke. Adding lemon zest early lets oils released gently, not bitter. Garlic skin on keeps cloves from burning and imparts sweetness. For wine pairing, medium-bodied reds work. Vegetables cook faster if sliced thin. If pressed for time, roast veal at 200 C but watch closely."
- "Swapping chicken broth for veg broth keeps recipe vegan adaptable but veal obviously not. Flours other than all-purpose or whole wheat like chickpea or rice flour need testing for thickening power. If sauce grainy, beat vigorously off heat or strain. Avoid overcooking peppers; they lose bright color and texture."
- "The balsamic vinegar is subtle but brings complexity balancing citrus and savory elements in sauce or vegetables."
introduction: "Roast veal. Not just brown it and call done. Know the heat, the timing, the texture. Let meat rest or juice runs out, dry on plate. Sage tucked under twine means herb scent all through, not just on surface. Garlic in skin, not scorched, softens in oven, little bursts of aroma when sliced beside steak. Zest lemon thin and early. Fluorescent yellow bits brighten meat flavor without sharp bitterness. Peppers cook slow, soften, keep distinct shape, not mush. Cherry tomatoes pop, releasing punch, mingling with fresh parsley. Pan sauce made from drippings thickened just right. Flour cooked off—no raw starchy taste allowed. Sip broth while stirring, watch it thicken, coat spoon. Serve to guests who appreciate effort, texture, and small flavor details. Simple ingredients but technique defines palate pleasure."
ingredientsNote: "Reducing veal size helps adjust cooking times easily. Sage delivers aromatic oils; fresh always, dried too subtle. Lemon zest needed fresh for brightness; freeze leftover zest for future use. Garlic cloves unpeeled roast differently than peeled—less chance to burn, still flavorful. Flour needs slow incorporation to avoid clumps; whole wheat adds earthiness. Broth: chicken or vegetable, depending on preference or diet restrictions. Lemon juice finishing touches brighten heavy sauce. Peppers assorted colors look inviting, taste layered. Shallots milder than onions; thin slicing speeds tenderizing. Cherry tomatoes chosen for sweetness, acidity balance. Parsley chopped fresh brings freshness, avoid dried unless nothing else. Added red chili pepper optional, adds gentle kick, or skip for heat-free version. Balsamic vinegar substitute for lemon juice deepens taste with subtle sweetness and acidity, a neat twist if lemons low."
instructionsNote: "Don’t rush initial sear—heat pan well so crust forms, locks juices. Insert sage under twine to infuse flavor internally. Resting meat allows fibers to relax and reabsorb moisture; 10-12 minutes minimum. Flour sprinkled and stirred off heat first prevents grainy sauce; add liquids gradually to keep smooth. Sauce simmered and reduced melds flavors and thickens naturally; avoid shaking or stirring too vigorously once thickened to keep silky texture. Vegetables cooked on medium to low heat to soften without burning; peppers should keep a slight bite not turn to mush. Cherry tomatoes burst on contact, timing tight or risk dryness. Parsley added at end to keep herbaceous notes fresh. Feel sauce thickness on back of spoon—needs to coat but still flow. Serve immediately after slicing meat to maintain juiciness; put on warm plates to keep everything hot without rewarming meat directly, which toughens fibers. Practice key to intuitive timings, sight, and feel."
tips:
- "Sear meat well; crust forms. Lock juices in. Sage tucked under twine flavors meat. Use fresh whenever possible. Garlic skin on; sweetens, burns less."
- "Timing; check doneness with thermometer. Watch temp clues, not just clock. Let it rest afterward. Juices stay; slice while hot but not burning."
- "When cooking sauce, sprinkle flour slowly to avoid lumps. Stir off heat first. Then add liquids gradually for a homogenous texture."
- "For veggies, keep them slightly crisp. Don't overcook peppers. Thin slices cook faster but hold shape. Listen for soft sounds, no char."
- "Swap chicken broth for veg stock if needed. Adjust flavor profiles as necessary. Balsamic vinegar can replace lemon juice for depth."
