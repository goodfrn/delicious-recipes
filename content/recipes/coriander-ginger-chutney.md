ingredients:
- "700 ml (3 cups) fresh coriander, leaves and tender stems, roughly chopped"
- "2 small tomatoes, diced"
- "6 scallions, thinly sliced"
- "5 garlic cloves, finely minced"
- "60 ml (1/4 cup) cold water"
- "40 ml (2 1/2 tablespoons) fresh lime juice"
- "20 ml (1 1/2 tablespoons) fresh ginger, grated"
- "1 green serrano chili, chopped (adjust to taste)"
- "6 ml (1 1/4 teaspoons) fine sea salt"
- "3 ml (3/4 teaspoon) toasted cumin powder"
- "3 ml (3/4 teaspoon) ground coriander"
- "10 ml (2 teaspoons) toasted mustard seeds"
instructions:
- "Load blender or food processor with coriander, tomatoes, and scallions first. Leave no air pockets; pack gently but firmly for better grind."
- "Add garlic, ginger, serrano chili last so they hit blades cleanly."
- "Pour in cold water and lime juice to help loosen mixture. Pulse in short bursts rather than continuous blend. Prevents heat buildup that dulls herb flavor."
- "Watch color—should turn bright green but not too watery. Stop once texture is smooth but still with some body; over-blending can make it gluey."
- "Fold in toasted cumin, coriander powder, mustard seeds by hand. Retains crunch and aromatic oil bursts."
- "Taste after salt. Don't skimp; balances the sharp lime and fresh herbs."
- "Store airtight, preferably glass, in fridge up to 5 days. Stir before use as liquid may separate."
- "Use with grilled lamb, fish, or mix into steamed rice. Great stirred into unsweetened plant yogurt for cooling contrast."
introduction: "Raw, unmasked coriander. Fresh, sharp, with an edge from lime and chili that wakes the palate. Think crunch and aroma—herbs chopped too fine lose punch, too coarse distract. Balance acid and heat right or it smacks bitter. Garlic adds depth, but overdo it and it dominates. Use scallions, fresher and sweeter than regular onion, to lift flavor and add texture. Toasting spices unlocks oils—don’t skip even if short on time. Experiment—swap serrano for milder jalapeno or hotter bird’s eye. Tomato softens, no cooking needed, bringing subtle sweetness. A chutney that hinges on sharpness and herbaceous lift, not drowning in sugar or tamarind."
ingredientsNote: "When coriander isn’t at its best, trim woody stems and use mostly leaves. Substitute scallions with chives or mild fresh onion only if scallions unavailable. Tomatoes—roma or vine-ripened preferred for fewer seeds and acidity balance. Lime juice can be swapped with fresh lemon; lemon alters flavor slightly but still bright. Water adjusted to get right texture; if your blender struggles, add less and pulse more. If mustard seeds unavailable, toast white sesame seeds for nuttiness but note flavor shift. Fresh ginger grated releases volatile oils; pre-ground won’t replicate impact but can be fallback. Garlic intensity varies by freshness; mild cloves preferred avoiding overpowering raw garlic bite. Adjust salt slowly—herbs can seem bland at first but salt pulls juice and scent from leaves. Keep all ingredients cold, especially for vibrant color and fresh herbal zing."
instructionsNote: "Use short pulses in a high-speed blender or pulse function on standard blender to reduce heat and preserve bright green color. Overprocessing turns mixture dull and bitter. Packing ingredients in layers ensures thorough blending; leafy herbs first. Don’t blitz continuously—stop occasionally to scrape down sides for uniform texture. Adding lime juice at start helps maintain vibrant color and adds necessary acidity to bind flavors. Fold in toasted spices last by hand to keep texture crisp and release aromatic oils just before serving. Avoid adding too much water; cloudy and runny defeats vibrant chutney texture. Store in sealed container in fridge; stir before serving as ingredients settle and separate. Great tip: prep early and let flavors marry for 1 hour before serving. Can freeze for later use but fresh is best for punch. If chutney tastes flat, add small pinch of sugar or extra lime to brighten. Consistency should be thick enough to spread or dollop, not pour."
tips:
- "Blend first ingredients tightly—no air pockets. Gently pack herbs, tomatoes, scallions. Easier grind, better flavor. Adjust chili heat carefully. Less work for good oversight."
- "Add garlic, ginger towards end. Strikes blades properly. Cold water helps, control consistency. Short pulses avoid overheating herbs. Dullness is enemy of freshness; keep it bright."
- "Toasting spices boosts flavor. Don’t skip. Mustard seeds or switch to sesame—both bring warmth. Fold in last, keeps crunch. Watch texture; should dollop or spread."
- "Coriander too coarse? Blending long on stems will lead to bitterness. Try more tomatoes or lime juice to balance out. Don’t ignore garlic intensity. Fresh is key."
- "Storage matters. Airtight is a must, preferably glass. Use within 5 days; stir before serving. Flavors intensify if prepped early. Freezing is an option, but fresh rules."
faq:
- "q: How to adjust spice level? a: Add chili in small bits. Try jalapeno for milder heat. You bet, more lime or yogurt also cools it down, works."
- "q: Garlic too strong? a: Use milder cloves, fresh ones help. Feel free to reduce amount. Balance flavors; don’t overpower herbs, find harmony."
- "q: What if it becomes bitter? a: More tomato can counter bitterness, adjust acidity. Too long blending causes it, better to blend quick short pulses."
- "q: How to store? a: Glass container recommended. Check for 5 days max, keeps well, just stir. Layer separation might occur, stir for even mix."
