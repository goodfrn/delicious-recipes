- "===Stir-Fry==="
- "Heat 25 ml oil in wok. Add green onions, shiitake mushrooms, snap peas, red pepper. Stir-fry around 4 minutes till vegetables are slightly tender but crisp."

introduction: "Cubes of marinated tofu soak in sharp ginger, bright soy, and red curry heat. Cooling overnight in the fridge. Hot oil sizzles, tofu crisps to golden chunks, held aside. The bright green of sliced onions, snap peas in thin ribbons, rich shiitake mushrooms, and a fiery red pepper join the pan. Baby corn adds crunch, garlic punches through. Coconut milk blends with chicken broth spicy with curry paste, bubbling gently just enough. Tofu returns, fragrant coriander lands last minute. Over fluffy jasmine rice. Layers of spicy, savory, fresh. Textures mix. A quick meal to brighten the plate and feed the soul."
ingredientsNote: "Use firm tofu for best texture, pressing it beforehand helps remove excess water. Red curry paste varies in heat; adjust quantity if sensitive to spice. Shiitake mushrooms can be swapped for cremini or portobello caps sliced thick. Unsweetened coconut milk keeps richness without sweetness, chicken broth adds depth but vegetable broth works for vegan option. Baby corn is optional but adds a sweet crunch that contrasts the spice. Fresh ginger and garlic finely minced release their aroma fully. Green onions sliced on the bias create nice visuals and mild bite."
instructionsNote: "Marinate tofu minimum an hour but longer really lets flavors penetrate. Drain well before frying to avoid splatter. Use medium-high heat for tofu crisping, avoid overcrowding pan so cubes brown evenly. Stir-fry vegetables quickly on high heat to retain crunch and vibrant colors. Adding garlic and baby corn later preserves their fresh flavors and texture. Combine broth and coconut milk with curry paste separately before adding to prevent clumps. Simmer gently to thicken sauce without burning. Toss tofu back in last minute to heat through without breaking pieces. Finish with fresh coriander off-heat to preserve its bright taste."
tips:
- "Use firm tofu. Press it first. Removes excess water. Helps tofu crisp better. Marinate for one hour. Longer is best. Overnight is ideal. Flavors penetrate well. Rinse and drain before cooking for less splatter."
- "Medium-high heat is key for frying tofu. Don’t overcrowd. Brown evenly. Crisp outer texture. For veggies, fast stirring on high heat keeps colors bright. Retain crunch. Add garlic and baby corn later. Preserve fresh flavors."
- "Coconut milk is rich but unsweetened. Prevents dish from being too sweet. Chicken broth adds depth. Works well, but for vegan, switch to vegetable broth. Adjust curry paste. Some brands pack a punch. Add more or less based on taste."
- "Slice green onions on the bias. Looks nice. Mild flavor. Mix shiitake mushrooms with other mushroom types. Cremini or portobello work fine. For richer taste, don’t skip ginger and garlic. Finely mince them for aroma."
- "Consider jasmine rice for serving. Fluffy texture pairs well. Balances spicy elements. Toss everything in the wok last minute. Heat gently to avoid breaking tofu. Fresh coriander adds bright finish. Right before serving is best."
faq:
- "q: What's the best way to marinate tofu? a: Tofu should soak in marinade at least an hour. Overnight is better. It allows flavors to penetrate deeply. Drain it well. This prevents sogginess when frying."
- "q: Can I substitute ingredients easily? a: Yes, you can. Shiitake mushrooms can be swapped for cremini or portobello. Baby corn is optional, but adds nice crunch. Adjust curry paste for heat preference. Don’t forget about coconut milk."
- "q: How can I store leftovers? a: Store in airtight container. Refrigerate up to four days. Tofu may lose texture. Reheat in skillet. Crisp it up again. Or microwave, but won’t be as crunchy."
- "q: What if I don't like coconut milk? a: Substitute with more broth. Cream but not sweet. Different taste but works. Also, consider almond milk for a lighter option. Texture will change, though; thinner sauce."
