ingredients:
- "1 medium eggplant, diced"
- "1 carrot, peeled and diced"
- "40 ml (2 1/2 tbsp) olive oil"
- "10 ml (2 tsp) tomato purée"
- "90 g (slightly less than 1/2 cup) red lentils, rinsed and drained"
- "450 ml (1 7/8 cups) homemade vegetable broth"
- "1 can 400 ml diced tomatoes"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, drained and chopped"
- "1 ml (1/4 tsp) smoked paprika"
- "325 g (just under 3/4 lb) penne pasta or similar short pasta"
- "Nutritional yeast, for garnish"
instructions:
- "Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add eggplant and carrot. Cook 6 minutes or until edges start to brown, stirring occasionally. Season lightly with salt."
- "Stir in tomato purée, cook another minute, breaking it up."
- "Add lentils, broth, diced tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, smoked paprika. Stir in salt and pepper."
- "Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low. Cook 18-20 minutes, stirring a few times, until lentils are soft and sauce thickened but not dry."
- "Meanwhile, boil salted water in a large pot. Cook pasta until just al dente, about 10 minutes. Reserve 1 cup pasta water. Drain pasta."
- "Mix pasta into lentil sauce. Add reserved pasta water gradually to loosen sauce, keeping it saucy but not watery. Taste and adjust seasoning."
- "Divide into shallow bowls. Sprinkle generously with nutritional yeast. Serve immediately."
introduction: "Ditch the usual zucchini and bell pepper. Eggplant and carrot bring sturdiness, color, texture. Lentils soak up the tomato-rich sauce thickened down with homemade veggie broth, not store-bought. Sun-dried tomatoes chopped small, hidden bursts of tang and chew. Smoked paprika takes over the chili flakes, adding warmth without heat. Penne pasta, no change, basic shape, toothy bite. Nutritional yeast here because some avoid cheese. Slightly less oil for lighter mouthfeel. Timing trimmed. Everything comes together in forty minutes flat. Little fuss, no flair, just honest ingredients, hearty and humble. Suitable for vegetarian, nut-free, egg-free diets. Easy, tweakable for any pantry."
ingredientsNote: "Replace zucchini and red pepper by cubed eggplant and carrot for earthier vegetables that stand up to long cooking. Red lentil quantity trimmed slightly to balance with slightly larger vegetable bulk. Sun-dried tomatoes still kept but in lesser amount. Smoked paprika swapped in for chili flakes to shift flavor toward smoky and mild rather than spicy. Oil reduced for lighter fat content but enough to caramelize vegetables well. Vegetable broth homemade if possible, better flavor with less sodium. Nutritional yeast substitution for parmesan keeps it vegan and nut-free, contributing umami and slight cheesiness. Pasta quantity slightly reduced too to balance plate portions."
instructionsNote: "Use medium-high heat to brown diced eggplant and carrot until lightly golden, about six minutes, stirring sometimes. Season with salt to enhance caramelization. Add tomato purée, heat through for a minute while stirring. Combine lentils, broth, diced tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, and smoked paprika. Stir thoroughly, seasoning with salt and pepper. Simmer uncovered for eighteen to twenty minutes, checking occasionally, until lentils melt down and sauce thickens but retains moistness. Meanwhile, prepare boiling salted water. Cook penne pasta 10 minutes or just until toothy firm (al dente). Reserve one cup pasta cooking water. Drain pasta well. Fold pasta into lentil sauce gently. Add pasta water bit by bit to loosen sauce to desired consistency — creamy but not soupy. Adjust salt and pepper after mixing. Plate into bowls, sprinkle nutritional yeast generously to finish. Serve hot right away for best texture."
tips:
- "Use medium-high heat. Brown eggplant and carrot well. About six minutes gives nice color. Stir occasionally for even cooking. Tip: Don't rush. Even cooking enhances flavor."
- "Salt enhances caramelization. Lightly season vegetables early. Tomato purée cooks quickly, about a minute. Stir through. Important for mixing flavors. Break into bits with spoon."
- "Simmer uncovered for perfect lentils. About 18-20 minutes. Check often, stir a bit. Saucy but not like soup. Thicker sauce gives better texture. Keep an eye on it."
- "Cook penne just al dente, around 10 minutes. Water must be salted well. Reserve a bit of cooking water. Essential for adjusting sauce afterwards. Don't forget this step."
- "Garnish with nutritional yeast. Gives umami and cheesy flavor. Sprinkle generously over pasta when serving. Delivers a nut-free finish. Adjust onions if desired."
faq:
- "q: How can I vary the vegetables? a: Add spinach or mushrooms. Swap in what's available. Just keep eggplant and carrot. More textures work well in sauce."
- "q: What's the best way to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in air-tight container. Good for three days. For longer, freeze portions. Just reheat gently. Thaw first."
- "q: How do I fix a watery sauce? a: Use cornstarch slurry to thicken. Mix a tablespoon cornstarch with water. Stir in slowly while cooking. Watch sauce thicken up."
- "q: Can I use different lentils? a: Yes but adjust cooking time. Green or brown take longer. Red lentils melt into sauce. Texture changes though, consider that."
