title: "Beef Tartines with Caramelized Leeks"
slug: "beef-tartines"
description: "Sear a tender cut of beef to medium rare. Poach leeks slowly in cream and cold butter till soft and almost jammy. Toast country bread with tangy mustard and melt aged swiss cheese atop. Layer thin beef slices, caramelized leek rounds, and bitter arugula leaves for a robust bite. Swap beef bavette for flank steak if needed. Use crème fraîche instead of cream for sharper tang. Grill bread until golden flashes appear; cheese should bubble not burn. Rest meat well or fibers tighten. Recognize poached leek softness by gentle fork puncture, leeks glistening, not soggy."

ingredients:
- "=== Caramelized Leeks ==="
- "3 white leeks, cut into 2.5 cm (1 inch) chunks"
- "80 ml (1/3 cup) crème fraîche"
- "50 ml (3 tbsp) cold unsalted butter, diced"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
- "=== Beef ==="
- "1 piece approx 500 g (1.1 lb) flank steak or bavette"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) grapeseed or neutral oil"
- "=== Tartines ==="
- "4 slices country-style bread"
- "35 ml (2 1/3 tbsp) whole grain mustard"
- "180 g (6 oz) aged Swiss cheese (Emmental or gruyère), sliced into 4 portions"
- "200 ml (slightly less than 1 cup) baby arugula"
instructions:
- "=== Caramelized Leeks ==="
- "Preheat oven to 190°C (375°F). Arrange leek pieces in a flat roasting pan. Add crème fraîche and butter cubes evenly. Salt and pepper generously. Cover tightly with foil for initial slow braise to keep moisture locked. Bake 38 minutes. Remove foil, stir gently to coat, bake uncovered further 7-8 minutes. Leeks should be glossy, tender, nearly falling apart but still holding shape. Fork pierces with little resistance, liquid slightly thickened. Let rest off heat."
- "=== Beef ==="
- "Heat heavy skillet over medium-high. Oil shimmers. Season beef on both sides with salt, press gently. Sear 3-4 minutes per side until crust forms and meat feels slightly springy but not hard. Internal temp 55-60°C (130-140°F) for medium-rare. Transfer to plate and tent loosely with foil; rest 15 minutes minimum. This locks juices and relaxes muscle fibers. Slice thinly against grain with sharp knife to avoid toughness."
- "=== Tartines Assembly ==="
- "Shift oven rack near top and preheat broiler to high. Lay bread slices on sheet. Smear mustard evenly but not thickly; needs balanced tang, avoids overpowering butter and cheese. Arrange 4 cheese slices per tartine covering almost entirely. Broil 4-6 minutes, watching closely—cheese should bubble, edges just begin to brown, bread crisp underneath but not burnt. Remove promptly to stop cooking."
- "Arrange sliced beef over cheese layer while tartines still warm so heat softens meat slightly without leaking juice onto bread. Add caramelized leek pieces in thin rounds over beef. Scatter baby arugula on top, gently pressing down to mingle flavors but keep leaves fresh and bright. Generous fresh cracked black pepper final touch. Ready to serve immediately for best texture contrast."
- "If no broiler, use hot oven at 220°C (425°F) and toast bread first, add cheese then return under heat briefly to melt."
- "Substitute crème fraîche with mascarpone for richer finish or use pancetta cubes crisped in pan for added salty crunch in leek mix."
- "Avoid overcrowding pan when searing meat; air circulation crucial to crust formation. Rest meat properly or end up with dry chew. Taste and adjust seasoning at plating stage because mustard and cheese saltiness vary."
introduction: "Leeks slow baked in cream and cold butter break down into near-jam consistency, sweet and silky with just a hint of crispness at edges. That contrast is key. Tough to get right without overcooking or turning mushy. Beef cut thin against grain after a hot pan sear stays tender and juicy. Bread thick enough to hold toppings but not soak, toasted under high grill to melt cheese while crisping edges. Mustard’s sharp punch cuts through creamy fat of leeks and cheese. Arugula’s peppery bite lifts the whole. Think texture and balance, not just flavor stacks. Timing critical. Don’t rush resting beef. Poach leeks slow, watch cheese carefully under broiler or it goes bitter. No fluff, just what works for solid tartines."
ingredientsNote: "Adjust quantities of leeks and cream depending on size; smaller leeks need less liquid. Cold butter added in cubes melts slowly aiding caramelization preventing separation which happens if mixed prematurely. Crème fraîche adds acidity to balance richness; mascarpone or sour cream substitute with slight change in flavor. Use high-quality flank or bavette beef for pronounced grain; flank is cheaper but requires sharper slicing against grain. Grapeseed oil preferred for high smoke point but vegetable oil works. Avoid thin sandwich bread; too soft. Country-style bread or rustic sourdough recommended. Mustard intensity varies by brand; test beforehand to avoid overwhelming cheese and leeks."
instructionsNote: "Start with oven for leeks. Covering traps steam, cooking slowly to breakdown fibers without drying out. Removing cover last minutes lets butter and cream reduce slightly, concentrating flavor and producing subtle glaze. Watch for subtle bubbling and golden coloration near baking end. Searing beef in very hot pan is key—proper crust seals juices; avoid overcrowding pan or beef will steam. Resting meat is non-negotiable to redistribute liquids. Broil bread and cheese carefully, eye on it lest cheese burn bitter. Assemble warm tartines rapidly so cheese softens beef but does not bleed juices making bread soggy. Final arugula must be fresh and added just before serving for crunch. Pepper should be fresh cracked for sensory impact. Experiment with timing and tasting to fit your oven and ingredient variances."
tips:
- "When preparing leeks, cut off tough green tops; use fresh, firm leeks. Cooking at low heat is key—stirring occasionally. Aim for glossy, tender texture."
- "Opt for high smoke point oil when searing beef; grapeseed is great. Don't overcrowd the pan. Watch for that beautiful crust to form—3-4 minutes each side, around 130-140°F internal temperature."
- "Broiling bread under high heat can burn quickly. Keep an eye on it. Look for bubbling cheese with light browning. Timing varies; ovens differ."
- "For beef cuts, flank steak is economical. Thin slices against grain ensure tenderness. If needed, substitute bavette; similar texture but different flavor notes."
- "Avoid soggy tartines. Assemble while warm, ensure leeks are scattered evenly to maintain contrast. Arugula needs to be fresh; add just before serving."
faq:
- "q: What if my leeks are tough? a: Cook longer at low heat. Cover them well. They should soften up. Stir gently; don’t let them brown too quickly."
- "q: Can I use a different cheese? a: Yes. Gruyère or Emmental works. Just ensure it melts well. Cheddar could work; sharper flavor but different texture."
- "q: How can I store leftover tartines? a: Best consumed fresh. If needed, wrap tightly. Keep in fridge. Reheat briefly in oven. Avoid microwave."
- "q: What if I've overcooked the beef? a: Slice thin. Serve over sautéed greens or incorporate in stir-fries. Mistakes can turn to other dishes."
