description: "A quick set peanut butter fudge swapping evaporated milk for cream and honey for vanilla. Cuts into sixteen squares. Butter browned to just melted stage, sugar dissolved before simmer. Watch bubbles form—start timer only when bubbling begins, not before. Chocolate chips sprinkled on half for texture contrast. Mixing with an electric paddle yields best consistency. Refrigerate overnight for firm but tender bite. Can substitute almond butter or maple syrup for nut or sweet twist. Keep fudge chilled to maintain shape. Avoid overheating to prevent grainy separation. Prep and cook roughly twenty-five minutes total with some watchful stirring."

ingredients:
- "1/2 cup unsalted butter"
- "1 cup packed light brown sugar"
- "3/4 cup evaporated milk"
- "1 cup creamy peanut butter"
- "1/4 cup honey"
- "4 cups sifted powdered sugar"
- "1/3 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips"
instructions:
- "Wrap 8×8 square pan tightly with plastic wrap. Let overhang for easy fudge removal."
- "Melt butter over medium heat in heavy-bottomed saucepan. Watch carefully—should be fully melted with no browning yet."
- "Add brown sugar and evaporated milk. Stir constantly to dissolve sugar before letting heat build."
- "When mixture starts bubbling all over (not a few bubbles on edges), set timer for 3 minutes, stir nonstop. Should look glossy and thickened but not scorched. Too hot, fudge will separate, grainy mess."
- "Remove from heat. Whisk peanut butter and honey in immediately so heat transfers gently. Wait for fudge aroma—nutty with caramel notes."
- "Transfer mixture into stand mixer bowl containing sifted powdered sugar. Use paddle at medium speed; hand mixing rarely gets right texture here. Mix roughly 4 minutes till fudge holds shape but still pliable."
- "Pour mixture into lined pan. For fun texture, scatter chocolate chips on half the surface and gently press in. Chips won’t melt much, add chew contrast."
- "Cover with plastic wrap, press onto fudge surface to prevent crust. Refrigerate minimum 7-9 hours or overnight until set firm but soft to touch."
- "Pull fudge from pan using plastic overhang, slice clean squares with sharp knife warmed under hot water each cut for neat edges."
- "Store chilled. Warmer temps soften fudge, lose structure. If fudge grainy or crumbly, chances are sugar overheated or mixed too long. Patience pays off."
introduction: "Brown butter smell, soft peanut aroma filling kitchen. Sugar dissolving with evaporated milk not quite boiling yet—watch the pot, bubbles signal stage change. Fudge making isn’t guessing game. Heat too high, grainy clumps form. Too low, fudge never sets right. Substitute honey for vanilla adds subtle floral undertone and helps keep fudge moist under refrigeration. Creamy peanut butter spreads warmth through mixture, improves pliability. Adding mini chocolate chips on half introduces texture difference without overwhelming nuttiness. Refrigerate long enough to set but not freeze, cut clean squares with warmed knife to keep edges tidy. This approach builds on fundamentals over shortcuts, giving consistent results. Try almond butter for twist or maple syrup in place of honey for different sweet note. Keep all dry ingredients sifted to avoid lumps. Stand mixer paddle attachment speeds integration for consistent texture, especially if mixing by hand struggled with graininess before. Chill fudge tightly wrapped or wax paper to prevent drying out. Worth every minute spent fine tuning timing and texture."
ingredientsNote: "Butter and sugar melted gently avoids burnt flavors that wreck fudge texture. Use light brown sugar, not dark—too intense and can make fudge bitter. Evaporated milk chosen over regular milk for creamier consistency and longer shelf stability—if unavailable, whole milk with splash heavy cream works but keep close eye on doneness. Honey replaces vanilla extract giving subtle depth and moisture retention; maple syrup can swap here for different nuance. Peanut butter creamy style blends better; chunky adds chew but affects smoothness. Powdered sugar must be sifted to prevent gritty lumps. Mini chocolate chips added post-cooking because melting them changes fudge texture and consistency. Setup lined pan with plastic wrap for easy unmolding; foil often sticks too much. Keep room for stirring and whisking space to avoid sugary ornaments on sides. Substitutions are flexible but each ingredient influences final bite and shelf life."
instructionsNote: "Heating butter alone tenderizes sugar mix; don’t rush melting or you risk scorching. Stirring constantly when sugar starts bubbling is critical to dissolve granules and reach proper fudge stage. The 3-minute timer kicks in only when full bubbling—not edges—signals stable cooking temperature. Overcooked fudge separates, grainy texture unavoidable. Remove immediately, whisk peanut butter plus honey to incorporate heat smoothly, avoiding clumps or seizing. Electric mixer with paddle attachment beats by hand for even texture and reduced mixing time. Mix about 4 minutes until fudge holds together but still malleable. Pour into lined pan, spread fast before firming. Press chocolate chips into half the fudge surface—keeps bite balanced without triggering melting or wetness on top. Wrapping fudge surface tight with plastic prevents crust from forming in fridge. Chill minimum 7-9 hours at least—fudge structure firms fully. Slicing with heated knife warms edges, prevents crumbling or cracked cuts. Room temperature fudge gets sticky and soft, so keep refrigerated until serving. If grainy or dry, check sugar melting stage and mixing time next batch. Occasionally small sugar crystals persist if powdered sugar uneven or heating uneven—best sift and stir thoroughly."
tips:
- "Start with unsalted butter, melt gently. Too hot, you risk burnt flavors. Watch the butter, not browned yet. Combine sugar into butter. Make sure it dissolves completely before heating."
- "Three-minute timer starts only when bubbling all over. Not edges. Stir nonstop during this time. Glossy, thick, but watch the heat, burn means grainy fudge. A few bubbles signal doneness too low."
- "Whisk peanut butter and honey into the bubbling mix immediately. Adds moisture, prevents clumps with heat. Stir until well mixed. Aroma shifts to sweet nutty. Important step for consistency."
- "Electric mixer really makes a difference in texture. Paddle attachment beats by hand. Mix about four minutes till fudge holds but still malleable. Look for subtle shine, not a lot of graininess."
- "Chill for a minimum of seven hours. Keeps fudge structure. Wrap it tightly to prevent crust. Warm knife cuts through easily. Heated for neat edges. Avoid warm kitchen, fudge softens."
faq:
- "q: How to fix grainy fudge? a: First check the cooking temperature. Overheated sugar causes it. Maybe lower heat or less stirring."
- "q: Can I use other nut butters? a: Yes! Almond butter works well. Adjust flavor somewhat. Maple syrup can replace honey for sweetness."
- "q: What's the best way to store fudge? a: Keep chilled in fridge. Wrapped tightly. Room temperature will soften it too much."
- "q: Why is my fudge too soft? a: Could be not heated enough. Sugar didn't reach the right stage. Next time watch closely while bubbling."
