ingredients:
- "4 medium flour tortillas"
- "20 ml softened olive oil"
- "250 ml shredded Monterey Jack cheese"
- "8 large eggs beaten with 80 ml heavy cream"
- "6 sliced scallions"
- "115 g diced chorizo"
- "1 serrano chili seeded and finely chopped"
- "15 ml olive oil for cooking"
- "1 medium seeded and diced tomato"
- "1 small avocado diced"
- "Fresh cilantro leaves"
- "Salsa rojo or green, store-bought or homemade"
- "Sour cream"
- "Salt and freshly cracked black pepper"
instructions:
- "Put oven rack at middle level. Heat oven to 160 C (320 F)."
- "Brush both sides of each tortilla evenly with olive oil. In a nonstick skillet over medium heat, toast tortillas one at a time, 1–2 minutes per side until golden and pliable. Place on baking sheet; sprinkle with Monterey Jack cheese then keep warm in oven to melt cheese."
- "Whisk eggs with heavy cream, add salt and pepper. Set aside."
- "In same skillet, warm olive oil over medium heat. Cook scallions and chorizo with serrano, stirring and breaking sausage up, about 4 minutes until sausage browns. Pour in egg mixture, gently stir over low heat, scrape bottom, cook slowly until softly scrambled and creamy. Season with salt and pepper."
- "Spoon chorizo-egg mix onto each cheesy tortilla. Top with diced tomato, avocado cubes, and cilantro leaves. Roll tightly from one edge to form burritos."
- "Serve with salsa of choice on side, plus dollops of sour cream."
introduction: "Chorizo chopped small. Eggs whipped with cream. Tortillas crisped in oil instead of butter. Monterey Jack stands in for cheddar, melts silkier. Serrano peppers bring a sharper heat than jalapeños. Avocado diced for rich creaminess added last. Salsa and sour cream optional but almost mandatory. Quick stovetop cooking. Cheese melts under low oven heat, keeps tortilla soft but warmed through. Mixing scallions and sausage early crisped. Eggs scrambled slowly to keep them tender, not dry. No fuss, fast and flavorful with a twist from the usual."
ingredientsNote: "Olive oil beats butter for tortilla coating here, less melting point, crispier texture. Monterey Jack cheese chosen for melt and mild flavor instead of sharper cheddar. Heavy cream with eggs adds richness and creaminess to filling versus milk, prevents dryness. Serrano pepper switches up the heat profile, more floral and intense than jalapeño. Fresh avocado diced separately keeps its texture intact rather than cooked. Scallions add fresh bite over cooking with sausage. Tomato diced and seeded to avoid excess moisture. Store-bought salsa works or homemade for freshness. Sour cream cooling contrast balances spicy chorizo."
instructionsNote: "Tortillas brushed with oil and toasted in skillet for flexible crisp shell—watch time closely to avoid burning; flip quickly. Cheese sprinkled once tortillas on baking sheet, kept warm in oven at moderate 160 C to melt without toughening. Eggs beaten with cream, then slowly cooked on low heat with scallions, chorizo, and serrano ensures creamy softly scrambled filling. Do not rush this step to preserve moisture. Assemble burritos immediately so cheese stays melty. Avocado and cilantro scattered on eggs, added last to maintain fresh flavors and texture. Roll tightly to keep filling contained, prevent falling apart when eaten. Serve alongside salsa and sour cream to customize heat and creaminess."
tips:
- "Use medium heat for chorizo. Crisping nature helps texture. Stir often, break sausage up small chunks. Incorporate scallions well. They add freshness. Don't rush this step. Perfect chorizo mixes in flavor with eggs."
- "Eggs beaten with heavy cream. Not milk. Richer and creamier filling achieved this way. A softer cook keeps them fluffy. Touch of salt. Freshly cracked pepper matters too. Adjust seasonings to taste."
- "Olive oil for tortillas preferred over butter. Higher smoke point, less burning risk. Toast until slightly golden. Flexibility important. Warm tortillas, they roll better. Cheese melted inside keeps it all together."
- "Fresh avocado cubes last added. Keeps pieces intact. Adds creaminess to the spicy filling. Don't cook it. Keeps texture separate. Consider lime juice. Brightness balances out flavors nicely."
- "Salsa and sour cream optional but highly recommended. They enhance flavors, adds moisture. Customization could vary spice levels. Try different salsas or toppings. Choice boosts enjoyment. Always serve on side."
faq:
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Wrap burritos tightly. Refrigerate, best for two days. Reheat in skillet or microwave. Don't overheat, can dry out."
- "q: Can I use different cheese? a: Yes, cheddar works but sharper flavor. Also try pepper jack for heat. Each variation brings unique taste. Experiment as desired."
- "q: What if I can't find serrano peppers? a: Jalapeños could substitute. Less heat but still nice flavor. Toss in more or less, adjust based on preference."
- "q: Can these be made ahead of time? a: Yes, prepare filling a day before. Assemble and heat closer to serving. Keeps flavors well, avoid sogginess."
