ingredients:
- "1 small knob of olive oil butter (about 6 ml)"
- "6 ml (1¼ tsp) diced green bell pepper per egg"
- "Egg whites and yolks from marked place settings"
- "6 ml (1¼ tsp) oat milk per egg"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
- "Round blue corn tortilla chips"
- "Fresh chopped cilantro for garnish"
- "18 ml (1¼ tbsp) shredded sharp cheddar cheese per egg"
instructions:
- "Begin by heating olive oil butter in a medium non-stick skillet over low heat."
- "Toss in diced green bell peppers; sweat slowly until softened, about 4 minutes."
- "While peppers soften, whisk together eggs and oat milk, season with salt and pepper."
- "Pour egg mixture into skillet; cook on low stirring gently with wooden spoon."
- "Keep eggs stirred gently so they remain creamy, take 5–6 minutes; do not overcook."
- "Spoon warm scrambled eggs onto corn chips arranged on a serving plate."
- "Top immediately with shredded cheddar and sprinkle chopped cilantro over all."
- "Serve at once while still warm and soft."
introduction: "Butter, eggs, peppers. Could be simple. Corn chips hold the mix, a little crunch with the creamy mix. Cheddar melts into the warm eggs, cilantro cuts through the richness. Quick. Bright. The bell pepper switch to green brings a fresh, slightly bitter edge. Oat milk swirls in instead of cow milk — creamy with a nudge of sweetness. No nuts, no gluten, still full of simple flavor. Easy to adapt, change cheese or herbs; always quick, always tasty little bites to pop. Unexpected. Fast. Good for sharing quick appetites or a nibble alongside drinks or a salad."
ingredientsNote: "The butter helps cook the peppers gently to bring out a mellow sweetness. Green bell peppers replace the usual red for a twist — more herbaceous, less sweet. Using oat milk keeps it dairy-friendly and adds a subtle creamy texture without changing color or taste drastically. The choice of cheddar adds a sharp tang that holds up on the corn chips better than mozzarella does here — providing a bold contrast. Fresh cilantro instead of parsley veers the flavor toward Mexican herbs, fits the corn chip theme. Scaling cheese and milk amounts keeps the eggs soft but flavorful."
instructionsNote: "Low heat is key to keeping eggs creamy, not rubbery or dry. Stirring slowly and constantly helps create texture without burning the bottom. Let peppers soften fully before adding eggs; crunch ruins the mouthfeel. The sprinkle of cheese should be generous but balanced; it melts on the warm eggs rather than baking on top, so add right before serving. Serve immediately so chips stay crisp, eggs stay warm. Switching the bell pepper color requires a second to adjust cooking time slightly as green peppers need more time to soften gently. The butter should foam but never brown — just melt and coat the pan."
tips:
- "Use low heat when cooking eggs. Keeps them creamy, not dry. Stir constantly, gentle motions. Scramble slowly to avoid rubbery texture. Patience needed."
- "Adjust bell pepper cooking time. Green peppers need longer to soften. Don't rush this step. Crunchy peppers ruin mouthfeel. Butter must melt only, no browning."
- "Top scrambled eggs immediately with cheese. Sprinkle generously. Cheese melts into the warm eggs, not on top. Serve right away for best flavor."
- "Consider adding different herbs or spices. Experiment with flavors. Options could enhance taste. Use your favorite cheese too. Cheddar versus mozzarella."
- "For a thicker filling, adjust egg amounts. Scaling quantities changes texture. Use more egg whites to lighten. Keep egg yolks for richness."
faq:
- "q: How to keep chips crispy? a: Serve immediately after topping. Chips get soggy if sit. Set up right before serving. Avoid stacking. Space them out."
- "q: What if eggs are overcooked? a: Start over. Low heat again for next time. Mistake happens. Scrambled eggs need gentle handling, which helps."
- "q: How long can they last in fridge? a: Around two days max stored. Place in airtight container. Reheat gently, or serve cold."
- "q: Can I use different milk? a: Sure. Other options exist. Almond or soy milk, alternative. Just watch what you choose. Substituting may change flavor."
