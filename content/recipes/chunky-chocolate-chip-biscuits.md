title: "Chunky Chocolate Chip Biscuits"
slug: "chunky-chocolate-chip-biscuits"
description: "A biscuit recipe combining all-purpose and cake flour for a lighter texture. Uses frozen coconut oil grated into the mix instead of butter for a subtle tropical note. Brown sugar replaces white sugar, adding moisture and a richer caramel flavor. Buttermilk swapped with kefir for a tangy, probiotic punch. Folded dough three times to build flaky layers. Cut biscuits with a sharp edge to avoid squashing air pockets. Baked at a slightly reduced 425F to keep edges tender yet golden. Finished with a quick vanilla-maple drizzle. Makes 10 to 12 thick, tender biscuits with crunchy edges or soft close sides depending on placement in pan."

ingredients:
- "2 cups all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled"
- "1 cup cake flour"
- "1/2 cup packed brown sugar"
- "1 cup frozen coconut oil, grated"
- "3/4 cup chocolate chunks"
- "1 cup kefir, plus 1-2 tbsp if needed"
- "2 tbsp melted coconut oil for brushing"
- "For drizzle==="
- "3/4 cup powdered sugar"
- "1/2 tsp vanilla extract"
- "3 tbsp heavy cream"
- "1 tbsp pure maple syrup"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone mat. Heat variances mean watch edges closely."
- "In a large bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, cake flour, and brown sugar. The lighter cake flour cuts the density of plain flour for fluffier biscuits. Brown sugar adds depth and moistness."
- "Grate the frozen coconut oil directly into the bowl. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work it into the dry mix until pea-sized bits form. The cold fat is key. Avoid warming it too much to maintain layers."
- "Stir in chocolate chunks gently to distribute without deflating the flour-fat mixture. Chunk size affects melting and chew—larger pieces keep more heat and bite."
- "Pour in the kefir slowly while stirring until dough just comes together. No gloppy mess needed — aim for a thick mashed potato consistency. Test stickiness with fingers; add extra kefir if too dry, or small flour dust if slimy."
- "Turn dough onto a floured surface. Knead lightly five to six times just to incorporate. Form a rough rectangle."
- "Fold the dough into thirds, like a business letter, creating layers. Dust flour as needed to keep it from sticking. Flatten gently back to a rectangle and repeat folds two more times. This layering builds flakiness without overworking gluten."
- "Press dough out to about 3/4 to 1-inch thickness. Use a sharp biscuit cutter without twisting to preserve rise. Tap edges clean with flour between cuts. Re-roll scraps immediately with minimal pressure and cut additional biscuits."
- "Arrange biscuits on pan either snug for tender, pull-apart sides or spaced apart for crisp edges. Brush tops sparingly with melted coconut oil for golden color and subtle tasting crust."
- "Bake for 18 to 20 minutes. The smell changes from raw flour to toasted sugar and butter notes. Tops should be golden, bottoms lightly browned. Insert a toothpick to check inside for moist crumb. Avoid over-baking; dry biscuits lose tender bite."
- "To make the drizzle, whisk powdered sugar, vanilla, heavy cream, and maple syrup in a small bowl. Adjust cream intensity to get a slow but fluid pour—thin enough to drip, thick enough to coat biscuit tops."
- "Drizzle warm biscuits right from oven. Let set a few minutes before serving to avoid glaze sliding off. Good both warm and cooled."
introduction: "Biscuits. Layered, flaky, yet tender. Toss out butter, coconut oil’s the ticket—grate it frozen. Adds tropical scent, firm shine. Brown sugar caramelizes faster than white—watch the oven; edges turn gold before you know it. Kefir brings tang plus culture benefits. Cake flour cuts heaviness, softens crumb. Tri-folding the dough three times. Builds tension inside, those flaky layers jump at the rise. No shortcuts. Cut with a clean edge, no twisting, or squished sides follow. Bake at 425F, five degrees lower than usual; prevents outside charring too soon. Drizzle vanilla-maple for a glossy finish—skip if you like savory. The dough feels like dense mashed potatoes, sticky enough to hold but not cling. That’s the dough telling you it’s ready. The smell and texture should coax you into the kitchen every time you want tender, nuanced, warm chocolate chip biscuits. Don’t wait for a special occasion—grab fatigue’s antidote right here."
ingredientsNote: "Spoon flour gently into your cup; never shake the measuring cup or pack it down. Too much flour kills tenderness. Cake flour thins the structure—don’t replace all with all-purpose unless you want denser biscuits. Coconut oil—subbing butter changes flavor and texture. Keep it frozen, grate immediately, or pieces won’t hold distinct layered lumps. Brown sugar must be packed, raw sugar isn’t a straightforward swap; dried molasses moisture improves biscuit softness. Kefir instead of buttermilk ups acidity and aids leavening subtly but richly. Heavy cream in drizzle can be swapped for whole milk but lose thickness; maple syrup adds depth. Chocolate chunks resist melting, chips tend to liquify faster, choose chunks if you want pockets of chewy chocolate instead of smooth melt through."
instructionsNote: "Don’t rush the folding. It’s what builds layers and flakiness. Over-knead, and gluten grabs too much—tough biscuits are born. Use a quick straight stamper for the cuts, twist and you seal the edges shut, no airy lift. Watch the biscuit edges crisp and turn golden brown—a tactile tap’ll feel firm, no squishy dough feel remaining. Timing varies; oven hot spots can brown one side faster. Reorganize pan halfway if needed. Brush with melted coconut oil lightly after cutting but before baking—helps crust but excess oil pools on pan bottom and fries biscuit undersides. For drizzle, the thinner the drizzle mixture, the more it runs off—add cream gradually. Let biscuits cool briefly or drizzle slides off. Cool them too long though and glaze dulls."
tips:
- "Grate frozen coconut oil. Key for layers. Shouldn’t warm too much, keeps texture. Use a box grater; toss in dry mix. Think small, size matters. Handles the weight; keeps integrity."
- "For baking, watch closely. Edges brown quicker; hot spots aren’t friends. Switch the pan halfway. Trust your nose—sugar toasts, chocolate melts. Smells sweet, like magic."
- "Kefir instead of buttermilk, adds zing. Won't need too much, balance stickiness. If dough feels too dry, slowly mix in extra. Tap fingers into it; sticky means ready."
- "To cut biscuits, sharp edge is a must. No twisting — kills lift, seals edges tight. Press down quick; keep shapes. Clean edges need dusting, avoid mashed sides."
- "If drizzle’s too runny, add more sugar. Need it to coat, not slide. Adjust cream gradually. Watch it flow; should cover tops neatly. Let sit a bit after drizzle."
faq:
- "q: How to fix overly dry biscuits? a: Start with extra kefir next time, or try butter. Sometimes dough doesn’t come together; needs more liquid. Too dense? Re-roll scraps carefully."
- "q: Can I use regular milk instead of kefir? a: Yes, but flavor will change, slight tang lost. Think texture will vary too. Some substitution really alters chemistry, keep notes."
- "q: What about storage for leftovers? a: Keep in airtight for a few days, avoid the fridge. If they lose texture, reheat gently, sprinkle water. Freshness is key."
- "q: What's best way to freeze? a: Shape uncooked biscuits; freeze on baking sheet first. Once firm, transfer to bag. Thaw before baking; adjust time—frozen takes longer."
