title: "Mustard-Infused Aioli"
slug: "mustard-infused-aioli"
description: "Aioli with tangy mustard and lemon replaces cider vinegar. Uses two egg yolks instead of a whole egg for richer texture. Olive oil and light sunflower oil mix for balanced flavor and emulsification. Substitutes water with ice-cold sparkling water for fluffier mayo. Whisking method adjusted for thickening cues rather than exact times. Salting at the end to avoid breaking emulsion."

ingredients:
- "2 egg yolks"
- "60 ml (4 tbsp) Dijon mustard"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) fresh lemon juice"
- "180 ml (3/4 cup) extra virgin olive oil"
- "100 ml (just under 1/2 cup) light sunflower oil"
- "20 ml (1 tbsp + 1 tsp) sparkling ice-cold water"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Set egg yolks, mustard, and lemon juice in medium bowl. Whisk briskly. Mustard acts as emulsifier; lemon juice adds bright acidity."
- "Start drizzling olive oil drop by drop while whisking rapidly, watching texture. When mixture thickens and turns creamy, increase oil drizzle to thin steady stream."
- "Alternate slower and faster whisking if mayo looks like it might break. Control key. Slow steady oil addition beats rushing."
- "Once olive oil incorporated and thick, slowly add sunflower oil continuing whisking to lighten up flavor and texture, keep emulsification tight."
- "Add sparkling water slowly in small amounts to loosen consistency. Feel the mix thicken then loosen then thicken again — watch mouthfeel in bowl."
- "Season last with salt and black pepper. Salt strengthens emulsion but adding too early risks breakdown."
- "Use immediately or chill covered. Returns thicker and flavor deepens refrigerated but can separate; whisk quickly before use if needed."
introduction: "Egg yolks, not whole eggs, pull the fat together. Mustard isn’t a flavor bump only; it’s emulsifier insurance. Lemon juice swaps for cider vinegar—fresh, sharper acid cuts fat better. Olive oil rich but heavy, light sunflower oil tempers, smooths edges. Sparkling water? Science meets kitchen—air bubbles lighten the nest of fat and water. Watch it thicken. Go too fast with oil, it breaks, a kitchen disaster. Whisk with intent: slow drip, rapid wristwork, tactile feel, visual firming—no guessing. Salt at the end; premature salting leads to meltdown. Keep it fresh, use knife skills next day, or underestimate patience at your own risk."
ingredientsNote: "Egg yolks preferred here instead of whole eggs. Egg whites don’t help emulsifying strength, can water down tang. Dijon’s sharpness not just for taste, helps hold the emulsion together. Lemon juice fluctuates in acidity so adjust quantities if mayo feels flat. The two-oil blend balances peppery notes from olive and neutral sunflower for less bitterness which often trips up home cooks. Sparkling water adds volume and body but avoid tap water with chlorine—kills yeast and flavor. If no sparkling on hand, very cold still water works but denser result. Salt timing critical; salt late prevents breakdown but locks flavors in."
instructionsNote: "Starting slow when adding oil makes or breaks your batch. The oily film has to bond around whisking air as you go. Egg yolks and mustard act as molecular glue—never underestimate their power. Whisk direction and speed are your best allies. If it separates, stop oil immediately, whisk vigorously with a spoonful of cold water to rebind. Moderate cold stimulates firming fats without clumping. Sparkling water stirs air bubbles to increase volume, lightens density—work it slowly and watch visual cues: creamy texture, no graininess, consistent sheen. Season after full emulsification or risk curdling. Chill before use, but expect thickening; loosen with brisk whisking. No blender needed; manual whisking tunes feel better than machines here."
tips:
- "Control the oil. Start slow; drop by drop. Watch for thickening—visual cue. Too fast? Breaks happen. Whisk consistently; feel for texture changes."
- "Sparkling water adds fluffiness. Ice-cold is key. Regular water? Risks density. Use if needed, but may alter mouthfeel. Experiment—get to know your water."
- "Fact: Salt at the end. Early salting risks breakdown. Wait until the emulsion is strong. Improper timing leads to separation. Season fully incorporated."
- "Texture cues matter. If looks off, stop oil—vigorously whisk with cold water to rescue. Cold is your friend. Warm = loss of emulsion."
- "Mustard is not just flavor. It’s an emulsifier. Keep enough for balance; adjust if brash. Lemon juice fluctuates; might need tweaks based on freshness."
faq:
- "q: Why separate? a: Often too much oil too fast. Whisk harder, slower oil addition. Viscosity changes can signal when to adjust speed."
- "q: How to store aioli? a: Refrigerate, tightly covered. Expect thickening. Before use, stir to loosen. If separation occurs, whisk back in."
- "q: Can I substitute oils? a: Yes, but taste varies. Olive for richness; sunflower for neutrality. Experiment good. Blend for balanced notes."
- "q: What if it doesn't thicken? a: Add more whisking. Cold water helps bind if too loose. Watch texture closely. Feel the mix; slow drip fuel action."
