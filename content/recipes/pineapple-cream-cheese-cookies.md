ingredients:
- "1/2 cup coconut oil softened"
- "4 ounces cream cheese softened"
- "3/4 cup granulated sugar"
- "1/4 cup heavy cream"
- "1 teaspoon lemon zest"
- "1 large egg"
- "1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour"
- "1 teaspoon baking powder"
- "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1/2 cup crushed pineapple drained well"
- "1 cup powdered sugar"
- "2 tablespoons pineapple juice"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 355 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper, no silicone mats here to keep bottoms crisp."
- "In a large bowl, beat coconut oil and cream cheese on medium speed until pale, fluffy, about 3 minutes. Don’t rush this step—air whipped in means lighter texture inside."
- "Add sugar and heavy cream. Beat 1 more minute until just combined, creamy but not greasy. Scrape bowl sides with spatula to avoid pockets of unblended fats."
- "Mix lemon zest and egg in. Beat just until you no longer see streaks of egg white. Overmixing after adding eggs tightens the dough; soft is what you want here."
- "In separate bowl, sift flour, baking powder, and salt together thoroughly. Leavening evenly distributed keeps cookies rising uniform."
- "With mixer on low, gradually add flour mixture to wet base. Avoid dumping it all at once; that causes clumps, uneven hydration. Use rubber spatula midway to finish folding once residue flour appears."
- "Fold in crushed pineapple gently to avoid bruising fruit and releasing too much juice. Texture needs chunks, moisture contained."
- "Scoop dough with 2-tablespoon sized scoop onto sheets. Space cookies 2 1/2 inches apart to avoid crowding. Too close they merge, lose edges that crisp."
- "Place trays in freezer 7-12 minutes, chill dough balls but not freeze hard. Palms pressed around dough spheres create neat shape. Skip rolling if short on time, they’ll just look rustic and a bit lumpy."
- "Bake 11 to 13 minutes. Watch edges—thin golden, bottom with faint browning. Tops puff, becoming matte but not cracked or shiny. Toothpick will come out with moist crumbs, not wet dough."
- "Cool on racks 15 minutes minimum. Transferring while hot risks breakage; hot cookie is fragile."
- "Make glaze by whisking powdered sugar and pineapple juice. Consistency matters; too runny glaze won’t stick, too thick won’t drizzle well. Aim for fluid but holds shape when drizzled."
- "Drizzle over cooled cookies or dip tops. Let glaze set for 20 minutes before stacking or serving to avoid sticky mess and preserve shiny finish."
introduction: "Cookies with a twist. Cream cheese plus crushed pineapple in dough. Look for the dough texture; soft but holds shape. Coconut oil replaces butter; subtle tropical note, better for flaky crumb. Lemon zest swaps vanilla to brighten flavor. Scoop dough into spheres—shape matters for even baking. Chill dough balls briefly to minimize spreading, especially if kitchen's warm. Bake until cookies puff, matte top signals set dough without dryness. Edges just golden, bottoms slightly browned. Wait on cooling. Glaze pierced with pineapple juice thins powder sugar—balance drizzle thickness. Let glaze set 20 minutes or risk smeared mess. Simple, quick, and rustic with a citrus bite and soft melt in the mouth. Bite into crushed pineapple chunks. No scorched bottoms; prevent with parchment, don’t crowd trays. The aroma: sweet butter and citrus with a hint of tang from cream cheese. Sounds of soft cracking tops and crunching edges when cooled. A cookie not too sweet, fine crumb, slightly chewy center."
ingredientsNote: "Coconut oil works here instead of butter for a slight nutty undertone and a lighter texture, especially if stored chilled before mixing. Room temperature cream cheese blends smoother, avoid lumps. If sharp cream cheese you like, use it—tang cuts sweetness nicely. Lemon zest preferred over vanilla to lift pineapple flavor, but vanilla can substitute no problem. Fresh crushed pineapple ideal, drained well to prevent soggy dough. Heavy cream adds richness and tenderness—milk isn’t a good swap here, it'll dry out cookies. Sifting flour with baking powder and salt ensures even rising, no pockets of baking powder that cause odd bitter taste spots. Powdered sugar glaze with pineapple juice adjusts sweetness and acidity. Use just enough juice avoid glaze that runs off the sides."
instructionsNote: "Creaming coconut oil and cream cheese until light traps air creating tender crumb. Mixing sugar and cream next dissolves sugar evenly, avoid grainy texture. Add zest and egg after ensures eggs incorporated but fragile proteins don’t overdevelop gluten. Sift dry ingredients separately for proper mixing; baking powder unevenly distributed causes uneven puffing or flat cookies. Adding flour slowly prevents tough dough from overmixing; stop as soon as flour incorporated. Folding pineapple gently preserves fruit texture and prevents excess juice from thinning dough. Chilling dough balls makes rolling easier, stops flattening and spreading in oven, especially in warm kitchens. Bake temperature slightly raised to 355°F promotes even caramelization and short bake time; watch cookies closely. Dollop test—tops firm but still yield slightly with press when done. Cool fully to set crumb before glazing; glaze too soon melts into cookie ruining texture. Glaze thickness controls drip; too thin runs off, too thick clumps. Rest glaze 20 minutes to harden properly on tops, enabling stacking without sticking. Store airtight for up to 3 days or freeze dough for up to 1 month."
tips:
- "Chill dough balls before baking. Prevents excess spreading. Also helps shape cookies. Just 7-12 minutes in freezer—skip rolling if you're short on time. They'll look rustic but taste great."
- "Watch for doneness. Edges should turn golden. Tops puff up a bit but look matte, not shiny or cracked. Testing with toothpick? Comes out with moist crumbs—perfect signal."
- "For crushed pineapple, drain well. Too much juice ruins dough texture. Super moist cookies don’t hold shape. Fresh pineapple preferred, but canned could work too—just squeeze out liquid."
- "Want them sweeter? Adjust sugar in dough, glaze thickness too. Add sugar gradually, taste as you go. Glaze? Mix powdered sugar and juice for drizzling—adjust to control flow."
- "Storing? Keep in airtight container for up to 3 days. Freeze extra dough balls for up to 1 month—huge time saver. Just thaw then bake fresh when cravings hit."
faq:
- "q: Why did my cookies spread too much? a: Some reasons, not enough chilling, warm dough. Oven temp too low makes a difference. Try adjusting these next time."
- "q: Can I substitute the coconut oil? a: Yes, butter works instead. But, coconut adds flavor and texture—might lose that tropical note. Other oils? Avoid strong flavors."
- "q: My glaze is too thin. What can I do? a: Simple fix. Add more powdered sugar, mix thoroughly. Just enough to hold shape when drizzled. Not runny but drizzles nicely."
- "q: How to store cookies for longer? a: Freeze cookies in an airtight container or zip bag. Separate layers with parchment to prevent sticking. Lasts well over a month."
