ingredients:
- "2 cans 567 ml (20 oz) peeled whole tomatoes"
- "8 cloves garlic peeled"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) olive oil"
- "1 roasted red bell pepper diced"
- "pinch smoked paprika"
- "salt and black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Rough chop roasted pepper into small pieces. Set aside."
- "Pulse tomatoes and garlic in food processor briefly. Keep some texture; avoid pureed paste."
- "Transfer mixture to pot. Stir in olive oil and paprika. Begin heating to boil."
- "Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally. About 40 minutes or until sauce thickens somewhat. Add roasted pepper mid-way through cooking."
- "Season with salt and pepper after simmering. Adjust to desired flavor intensity."
- "Serve warm with pasta or as base for other dishes."
introduction: "Canned tomatoes as base. Garlic for bite. A hint of smoky paprika sneaks in. Roasted red peppers chopped, not blended. Adds depth and flickers of sweetness. No rushing. Long simmer, but not too long. Keeps some texture. Oil trimmed down a bit, no drowning. Salt and pepper later, to taste. Not just a sauce, a platform. Go heavy on pasta, or grab bread. Simple elements, slightly twisted. Cooking that waits but doesn’t wait forever. Something thick enough without losing brightness."
ingredientsNote: "Two cans instead of the usual big ones – slightly smaller. Garlic ups from six to eight cloves. Olive oil cut by a quarter. Roasted red pepper added, prepped separately then stirred in. Smoked paprika for a touch of heat and complexity, replacing some seasoning staples found in plain sauces. Salt and pepper remain last step, personalized. Keep the garlic raw before processing to maintain punch, not harsh. Combining fresh steps with pantry staples."
instructionsNote: "Start by chopping roasted pepper alone to preserve distinct chunks. Pulsing tomatoes and garlic just enough – pulsate carefully, not pureeing into oblivion. Blend aims for rough texture, more tactile mouthfeel. Stir in oil and paprika before heat hits to infuse flavors. Simmer time cut slightly, 40 minutes instead of 30-45, to hold moisture but concentrate. Roasted pepper added after fifteen minutes to avoid mushiness. Salt and pepper season at the end. Stir often enough, but no frantic stirring to keep sauce consistency varied. Serve soon or cool and refrigerate."
tips:
- "Roasted pepper – aim for small dice. Keeps shape in sauce. This adds color and flavor. Don't skip it, texture is key. Better than blending."
- "Pulse tomatoes gently. Not a puree. Think chunky, not smoothie. Garlic added still whole. Big punch, full flavor. Maintain bites, mouthfeel you want."
- "Watch the simmer. 40 minutes max. Too long, it loses bright flavor. Stir occasionally. Keep it varied but don't frantically mix. Take your time."
- "Season at the end, salt and pepper adjust to taste. Each bite should be personal. Smoked paprika brings warmth. Too much can overpower."
- "Use fresh ingredients when possible. But canned works just fine. Faster prep, flavors are good. Mix pantry with fresh, keep balance simple."
faq:
- "q: Can I use fresh tomatoes? a: Yes but longer cooking time needed. Peel them first. More effort but flavor can be worth it sometimes."
- "q: How long can I store the sauce? a: Up to one week in fridge. Can freeze too. Keep in airtight container. Thaw before reheating, simple enough."
- "q: What if the sauce is too thick? a: Add a splash of water or broth. Stir it in slowly at heating. Keep an eye on consistency. Adjust as needed."
- "q: Can I add meat to the sauce? a: Sure, ground beef or sausage works. Brown it first. Then add to sauce while simmering. Lots of options here."
