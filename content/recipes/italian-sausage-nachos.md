slug: "italian-sausage-nachos"
description: "Sausage-spiked nachos layered with peppers, fresh herbs, and gooey cheese. Tomatoes and tangy pickled peppers blend with red wine vinegar and garlic, lifting every bite. Charring cheese under broiler heat gives a crisp bubbly top. Sub tiled tortilla chips hold toppings but watch overlap or sog. Prep and cook shift with sensory clues rather than clock. A bit of oregano swapped for parsley; sweet onion swapped for shallot keeps it sharp yet mellow. Tomato puree added for depth, a splash of balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar for bite twist. Simple. Fast. Ready to snack within 25 minutes."

ingredients:
- "2 cups diced roma tomatoes"
- "1 cup diced red bell pepper"
- "½ cup finely chopped shallot"
- "¼ cup chopped fresh oregano leaves"
- "3 cloves garlic minced"
- "½ cup diced pickled cherry peppers, drained"
- "2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar"
- "¾ teaspoon kosher salt"
- "½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"
- "1 large bag sturdy tortilla chips"
- "8 ounces Italian ground pork sausage"
- "2 tablespoons olive oil"
- "1 cup crushed tomato puree"
- "1½ cups shredded provolone cheese"
- "Fresh basil leaves for garnish optional"
instructions:
- "Pulse pork sausage in skillet over medium heat with olive oil breaking up chunks until just browned and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Do not overcook; will finish under broiler."
- "In bowl, mix roma tomatoes, bell pepper, shallot, oregano, garlic and pickled cherry peppers. Pour balsamic vinegar over all. Salt and pepper now not later to balance flavors well."
- "Add crushed tomato puree to sausage and warm for 2 minutes to slightly thicken sauce. Pull off heat promptly to prevent drying out sausage."
- "Spread tortilla chips on large rimmed baking pan lined with foil for cleanup. Overlap chips moderately; too much smothering equals soggy base."
- "Layer cooked sausage mixture over chips evenly. Spoon fresh pepper-tomato salad carefully to avoid pooling liquid on chips—use slotted spoon if needed."
- "Sprinkle provolone cheese thickly covering toppings. Provolone melts richly but browns slower than mozzarella—easier to control under broiler."
- "Set oven rack approximately 6 inches from broiler. Place pan under high broiler heat. Watch constantly—edges start crisping, cheese bubbles and starts to brown in about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove instantly when cheeses bubblies and golden brown spots appear."
- "Serve hot. Garnish with fresh basil leaves if on hand. Either spoon more crushed tomato puree warmed on side or drizzle over nachos quickly before serving to avoid sog chips."
- "Remember: watch cheese—not just time. If broiler heats unevenly rotate pan halfway. Never walk away."
- "Leftover sausage can go into breakfast scramble next day. Aleppo pepper more forgiving alternative to cherry peppers if you want slight smoky heat."
introduction: "Got leftover Italian sausage? Or want something quick that leans flavorful but not fussed up? Italian spins on nachos. Forget melting the cheese on stovetop or microwave—high broiler does the trick fast, brings crunchy cheesy edges you want. The fresh pepper and tomato salsa cut through richness; balsamic vinegar adds unexpected twist sharper than red wine vinegar in the original. Pickled cherry peppers swap out peppadews—both give that zing but cherry peppers are easier to find and pack punch. Instead of plopping wet salad on chips, scoop carefully to keep the base crisp. Crucial. Cooking smells stinging garlic and browning sausage. Keep an eye on bubbling cheese—the sound’s your timer. Toss fresh basil after cooking if you want bite of herbal freshness without wilting heat. Sturdy chips, timing, layering. Not rocket science. But if you pile too thick or drip liquid recklessly, it gets messy fast. So keep chips chip, cheese melty, toppings fresh. That’s what works."
ingredientsNote: "Switched parsley for oregano here. Oregano stands up better to heat and keeps brightness; parsley is softer and can fade. Shallot replaces sweet onion for sharper, subtler hit that doesn’t overpower. Pickled cherry peppers in place of peppadews; Carolina or Fresno chilis could substitute if you want less tang and more heat, but drain well. Added crushed tomato puree for sauce body and richness. Balsamic vinegar changes acidity profile from red wine vinegar, giving deep berry notes that marry well with pork sausage and cheese. Consider grease in sausage; draining before adding reduces sogginess but you lose flavor. Instead, cooking out fat off pan then using that fat to caramelize shallot or garlic adds taste. Keep salt moderate since sausage and pickled peppers already salty."
instructionsNote: "First brown sausage well but not fully dry it out. It finishes cooking under broiler and stays tender. Use olive oil for caramelization and flavor lift over neutral oil. When mixing fresh salsa, toss just enough to lightly coat, too much vinegar or salt early overpowers. Layer chips with moderate overlap—not too thick—otherwise bottom chips sog. To avoid soggy nachos, spoon fresh produce mixture with a slotted spoon to drain excess liquid. Cheese selection key—provolone melts slowly, offers smoother grilled flavor, mozzarella melts faster but can get stringy and watery fast when broiled. Broiler placement about 6 inches away from heat source safe for even melting and browning. Monitor constantly for bubbling and seeing crispy golden edges; no one wants burnt cheese. Rotate pan if broiler heating unevenly. Serve immediately. Warm tomato puree extra on side or drizzle last moment to avoid chips losing crunch. Don’t douse in sauce before baking—it will be wet mess. Fresh basil gives herbal brightness that wilts if placed too early, so add post-broil."
tips:
- "Don’t skimp on the aroma of browning sausage; sound of sizzling fills the kitchen. Heat matters. Use a sturdy skillet, keep that heat medium. Avoid overcooking. Flavor lost."
- "Layer chips but don’t prison them. Moderate overlap means crispy edges. Can’t pile too thick—soggy tortilla chips ruin crunch. Spoon salsa gently."
- "Cheese choice? Provolone gives rich melting—but browns slower than mozzarella. Keep an eye on bubbling. Avoid burnt edges; important especially with broiler. Even melts."
- "Tomato puree adds depth. Too much mess with fresh tomatoes pooling liquid; skip this. Sauté in the sausage fat for added flavor—technique matters."
- "After broiling, basil adds freshness. Stun flavor but don’t wilt it prematurely. Drizzle warmed sauce last moment. Keeps nachos crispy. Always end on a high note."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid soggy nachos? a: Drain salsa excess, use a slotted spoon. Keep balance; chunky topping adds texture."
- "q: What if I don't have provolone cheese? a: Use mozzarella but note—it gets stringy faster; keep eyes peeled for bubbling."
- "q: Meat alternatives for sausage? a: Ground turkey or chicken works, but season them well. Lighter options can fall flat without flavor."
- "q: Storage solutions? a: Store leftovers in airtight. Up to three days max. Reheat gently in the oven—avoid microwaving, sogs chips."
