ingredients:
- "100 g (1 cup) quick oats ground finely"
- "30 g (1/4 cup) whole wheat flour"
- "30 g (1/4 cup) almond flour"
- "3 ml (1/2 tsp) baking soda"
- "pinch of salt"
- "180 g (3/4 cup + 2 tbsp) coconut sugar"
- "40 g (3 tbsp) unsalted butter softened"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) olive oil"
- "50 g (3 tbsp) Greek yogurt plain, full-fat"
- "1 large egg"
- "125 g (4.5 oz) bittersweet chocolate roughly chopped"
instructions:
- "=== Dough Prep ==="
- "Pulse oats in food processor until fine but not powdery. Aim for sand-like texture to retain some bite."
- "Mix ground oats, whole wheat flour, almond flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Blend dry ingredients thoroughly to distribute leavening evenly, avoids flat cookies."
- "In larger mixing bowl, cream softened butter with coconut sugar and olive oil using wooden spoon or paddle attachment. Sugar not fully dissolved, grainy texture helps caramelize during bake."
- "Add Greek yogurt and egg; mix until just combined. Yogurt adds moisture and tenderness, replacing part of fat without greasiness."
- "Fold in dry ingredients and chocolate chunks gently. Avoid overmixing; gluten overdevelopment toughens texture."
- "Wrap dough, chill minimum 70 minutes. Cold dough firms fats; prevents spreading in oven, promotes even baking."
- ""
- "=== Baking ==="
- "Set oven rack middle position for balanced heat."
- "Preheat oven to 185°C (365°F). Slightly lower than usual to avoid overly browned edges with moist centers."
- "Line two baking trays with silicone mats or parchment paper for easy release and cleanup."
- "Use 30 ml (2 tbsp) scoop, drop dough balls 5 cm apart. No need to press down; spreads naturally."
- "Bake one tray at a time to maintain consistent oven temperature, about 11-13 minutes. Edges should turn golden and crispy; centers will look slightly underdone and jiggle when tray shaken."
- "Remove from oven, leave cookies on hot tray 8-10 minutes. They firm up as they cool; resist urge to move too soon or they’ll crumble."
- ""
- "=== Storage ==="
- "Once cool, store airtight at room temp up to 5 days. Avoid fridge; increases hardness."
- "Can freeze dough balls separated by parchment; thaw 30 minutes before baking."
introduction: "Crunch of oats meets bittersweet shards. Texture balanced—chewy centers, slightly crisp edges. Sugar swap to coconut shifts sweetness, adds depth. Butter sliced with olive oil and Greek yogurt shields against dryness but keeps bite. Almond flour sneaks nuttiness, nothing overpowers. Chilling the dough essential; controls spread, develops flavor. Baking low and slow, edges first to toast; center stays tender, soft like pillow. Cool on tray—cookies still fragile hot, wait for structure to set. Store sealed, freshness fades fast at room temp but worth every crumb. No rush here—patience yields texture nuance that counts."
ingredientsNote: "Grinding oats finely helps dough bind better, avoids gritty mouthfeel common in oats cookies. Whole wheat flour remains to nourish structure and add earthiness, almond flour brings protein and subtle nut flavor without adding whole nuts, good for those avoiding them. Coconut sugar lowers glycemic index compared to refined white or brown sugars; expect slightly darker color and hint of caramel. Olive oil replaces canola oil; richer, more flavor with antioxidant content. Greek yogurt replaces part of butter—tradeoff for moisture, fat reduction without sacrificing tenderness. Chocolate bittersweet, chopped coarsely to keep melty pockets, roughly chopped pieces stay intact better than chips under heat."
instructionsNote: "Pulse oats to correct texture; too fine turns gummy, too coarse yields weak binding—goal: sandy. Cream fats and sugar for lightness, grainy sugar crystals essential for final crust texture; cream too long equals greasy dough. Yogurt must be added with egg before dry ingredients to prevent clumping. Fold dry in carefully—over kneading equals tough biscuit. Rest dough cold minimum one hour—fat firms, hydration spurs gluten development arrest and flavor deepen. Bake at moderate heat; hotter burns edges prematurely. Watch color, don’t rely solely on time—edges gold, centers still glossy and soft to touch indicates readiness. Cooling on tray crucial; moving hot cookies causes breaks. Store in airtight container, avoid refrigeration which dries cookies rapidly. Freezing dough balls is an easy make-ahead—thaw briefly, bake fresh."
tips:
- "Grinding oats finely is crucial. Too coarse won't bind, too fine turns gummy. Aiming for sandy texture is key."
- "Chill dough for at least an hour. Cold dough firms fats, controls spread in baking. Flavor develops better cold, too."
- "Use parchment paper for easy cookie release. Saves cleanup time. Don’t skip it; burnt edges are more than just looks."
- "Baking at lower heat yields softer centers. Watch closely. Edges should be golden, centers slightly jiggly might feel underbaked."
- "When cooling, leave cookies on tray. Moving them too hot causes breaks. Need to firm up when cool. Wait patiently."
faq:
- "q: What if dough gets too sticky? a: Add a bit more flour if necessary. Handle minimally. Avoid overworking. Keep chilling."
- "q: Can I substitute with other sugars? a: Brown sugar works and gives moisture. Remember texture changes slightly. Granulated won't be as soft."
- "q: What if I want to mix in nuts? a: Nuts are fine! Just keep amounts balanced. Too many can change texture significantly. Less dough possible."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Store in airtight container. Room temp for up to 5 days max. Don’t refrigerate; it dries cookies fast."
