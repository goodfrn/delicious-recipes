description: "Zucchini slices take the place of noodles, rolled tight with ricotta, mushrooms, and spinach filling. Sautéed aromatics build flavor; white wine adds brightness. Salt draws moisture from zucchini, prevents soggy mess. Baked in skillet with marinara, mozzarella, parmesan topping. Cheese bubbles, browns, and melds into sauce. Serve topped with fresh basil. Egg binds filling; frozen spinach convenient, drained well. Substitute cremini mushrooms if white button unavailable. Scroll past soggy zucchini pitfalls and avoid overcooking cheese. Oven time guides, but watch lasagna’s bubbly edges and golden crust. A rustic twist on classic baked comfort. Prep, cook, and rest times balanced for texture, flavor that’s layered, not muddled."

ingredients:
- "3 medium-large zucchinis sliced 1/8 inch thick"
- "1/3 cup fine sea salt divided"
- "1 1/2 tbsp olive oil"
- "8 oz cremini or white button mushrooms diced"
- "1 medium red onion diced"
- "3 garlic cloves minced"
- "2 tbsp dry white wine or chicken broth"
- "1 1/4 cups full fat ricotta cheese"
- "1 egg large"
- "5 oz frozen chopped spinach thawed and thoroughly drained"
- "1/4 tsp black pepper"
- "3 tbsp fresh basil chopped"
- "1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese"
- "1/2 cup grated Pecorino Romano"
- "1 cup marinara sauce homemade or store-bought"
instructions:
- "=== Prep Zucchini ==="
- "Slice zucchini very thin, aim for 1/8 inch; if too thick, rolls get bulky and take longer to cook. Lay slices single layer on paper towels. Sprinkle both sides with 1/6 tsp sea salt and let sit 20 minutes. Salt pulls water out, how you avoid watery baked zucchini. Pat dry thoroughly with fresh towels — don’t skip or lasagna sogs."
- "=== Cook Filling ==="
- "Heat olive oil in large skillet over medium-high. Toss in mushrooms, diced red onion, and garlic. Stir often, listen for gentle sizzle; aromas soften and brown about 5-6 minutes. Mushrooms should shrink, onions translucent and edges caramelizing. Splash in white wine or broth, scrape all the browned bits off bottom with wooden spoon. Cook off liquid until nearly gone — you want that depth but no liquid pooling. Remove from heat to cool."
- "=== Mix Filling ==="
- "In bowl, combine mushroom mix plus ricotta, spinach (make sure no excess water), egg, black pepper, and half the basil. Stir gently just till incorporated. Using Pecorino Romano adds sharper salty punch vs parmesan. If you don't have Pecorino, use parmesan. Adjust salt cautiously — filling salty enough from mushrooms and cheese."
- "=== Assemble Rolls ==="
- "Lower oven temp to 375°F; steady heat gets bubbling cheese without burning faster. Spread 1/2 cup marinara evenly in bottom of cast iron or oven-safe skillet. Use about a tablespoon filling on end of each zucchini slice. Roll tightly but don’t squeeze so filling oozes out. Stand rolls upright in sauce, pack rolls snug; helps hold shape and heats evenly. Extra filling spread thinly on top in between rolls — seals moisture and adds cheesy pockets."
- "=== Top and Bake ==="
- "Spoon remaining marinara over rolls, sprinkle mozzarella and Pecorino evenly on top. Bake uncovered 28–33 minutes. Cheese should melt, bubble; edges of sauce might thicken. Surface browns lightly, not burnt. Use visual cues; if cheese browns too fast, tent with foil last 5 minutes. Let rest 5 minutes after oven—makes slicing neater and filling settles."
- "=== Serve ==="
- "Scatter remaining fresh basil over lasagna rolls before serving, optional extra grated cheese. Good with crusty bread or light salad. Rolls keep shape if cooled slightly, so don’t rush digging in. Leftovers reheat well covered in microwave or oven."
- "=== Alternatives & Tips ==="
- "If zucchini watery or soft, pat more or salt longer. No wine? Use broth or water with splash lemon juice to brighten flavors. Ricotta can swap for cottage cheese — blend for smoother texture, but less creamy. Use spinach fresh in spring; sauté and drain well, or replace with kale or Swiss chard—just cook leaves down before adding. For vegan twist, replace cheeses with nut-based alternatives and egg with flaxseed meal mixed with water. Non-stick sheet can replace cast iron for lighter bake but won’t brown crust as well."
introduction: "Skip the noodlebloat. Thin zucchini slices become vessels for ricotta-spiked mushroom-spiced filling. Salting zucchini extracts excess water, early step that defines success. Skipping that leads to limp, mushy rolls drowning in salty sauce. Melted mozzarella and Pecorino create a golden, slightly crisp top — signal the bake is done. Don’t rush. Heat distribution matters, so rolls stay firm but creamy inside. Using red onion adds sweetness punch; garlic raises umami. White wine cuts fat from cheese, brightens. Frozen spinach is a shortcut; thaw and press dry thoroughly to avoid waterlogging. Cast iron skillet means even heat and a seared bottom crust. Best served hot but not scalding—let cheese set before cutting. Offers an upgrade on veggie lasagna—lighter, more textured, punchy herbs and fresh cheese."
ingredientsNote: "Salt zucchini twice the much as you think. Water is biggest enemy of layered dishes with fresh veggies. Olive oil sets foundation—don’t cheap out. Fresh garlic always better than powder. Unseasoned frozen spinach is easier than fresh, but squeeze excess moisture or use spinach cooked down in pan. Use Pecorino Romano if you want sharper bite over parmesan—and it melts better, less grainy. Mozzarella needs to be low moisture; whole milk shredded mozzarella beats pre-shredded every time—freshness affects melting and texture. Egg binds filling, so don’t skip or replace with commercial egg substitutes since they don’t work structurally here. Use wood spoon for deglazing pan to keep bits intact—it’s flavor gold. If lacking cast iron, ceramic or oven-proof glass works but adjust baking times; you won’t get same crispy edges."
instructionsNote: "Salting zucchini twice then drying is non-negotiable—skip and you face soggy rolls. Use mandoline or sharp knife, thin slices even thickness to prevent uneven cooking. Sauté mushroom mix until visibly shriveled, onions translucent and starting to brown, smell sweet and rich—don’t rush this, it deepens flavor. Wine splash scrapes fond—don’t pour it in and ignore pan bottom; that dragged-up fond builds layers of taste in filling. Allow filling to cool before mixing cheese and egg or you’ll scramble eggs unintentionally. Rolls should stand upright snugly; if they fall, re-roll tighter or trim thick ends. Bake at lower temp than original; slow heat prevents cheese scorching, melts filling evenly. Keep eye on cheese glow rather than clock; bubbling edges and gentle golden hue best doneness indicators. Rest lasagna 5 minutes before cutting—keeps rolls intact. Fresh basil sprinkled last for bright herbal pop."
tips:
- "Salt zucchini lots. Water is the enemy here. Cut slices thin-1/8 inch works best. Lay on towels and hit with salt. Wait 20 minutes. Pat dry. Skip this and fillings get mushy. Soggy rolls ruin everything."
- "Mushroom mix must sizzle. Heat olive oil well. Toss in diced onions, garlic, and mushrooms. Keep stirring. Brown edges, bring out sweetness. Splash in wine, scrape those brown bits off. All flavor trapped there."
- "Ricotta must be richer. Use full fat. Combine with spinach thoroughly drained and cooled down. Add egg last. This binds everything together. Volume’s key, don’t overstuff rolls or they burst in sauce."
- "Keep oven temp steady; 375°F works well. Prevent cheese scorching. Watch for bubbling edges and light browning. If cheese browns too fast, tent with foil. Cooking times can vary based on oven and dish type."
- "Let lasagna rest. After baking, 5 minutes cool down helps set everything. Cutting too soon leads to chaos, filling spills. Holds better when slightly cooled. Leftovers store well, good for reheating too."
faq:
- "q: Can I use other veggies? a: Yes, swap zucchini for eggplant or bell peppers. Just slice thin. Stay mindful of moisture, same salting technique applies."
- "q: No ricotta, what now? a: Cottage cheese can sub in. Blend for creamier texture. Not as rich, but works. Check moisture levels, drain well. Adjust seasoning accordingly."
- "q: Storing leftovers? a: Refrigerate covered. Best consumed within 3 days. Reheat in oven for crisp edges or microwave for quick warm-up. Watch not to overheat."
- "q: How to keep it from being soggy? a: Salt zucchini well and pat dry. Focus on cooling the mix before rolling. Adjust baking time based on how wet it looks."
