description: "Macaroni tossed with basil pesto, pan-seared chicken strips, and juicy grape tomatoes paired with soft burrata chunks. A spin on classic Italian flavors, swapping bocconcini for rich burrata and standard tomatoes for grape tomatoes to boost sweetness. Olive oil and lemon juice offer brightness, balancing the creamy pesto. Cooking macs al dente keeps firm bite, avoiding mush. Chicken gets a golden crust from proper preheating and oil use. Assembly cold and hot provides contrasting textures."

ingredients:
- "160 g (1 1/4 cups) grape tomatoes, halved"
- "1 container 180 g burrata, torn into pieces"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) extra virgin olive oil"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) fresh lemon juice"
- "350 g elbow macaroni"
- "100 ml (about 1/2 cup) basil pesto"
- "4 boneless chicken breasts"
- "Fresh basil leaves for garnish (optional)"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Halve grape tomatoes, toss gently with lemon juice and 15 ml olive oil in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Tear burrata into rough pieces, fold in carefully without breaking too much. Leave at room temp to marry flavors."
- "Bring large pot of salted water to roaring boil. Add macaroni and stir immediately to prevent sticking. Cook until just tender but still toothy when bitten - start checking around 8 minutes. Drain promptly, saving a splash of pasta water as backup."
- "In large non-stick skillet, warm remaining olive oil over medium-high. Wait until oil shimmers but doesn’t smoke - this ensures golden crust, not soggy chicken. Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Cook in batches if needed. Sear chicken about 4 minutes per side or until an internal temp of 75°C reached. Rest on board 5 mins, then slice into strips against grain."
- "Return drained pasta to pot off heat. Spoon pesto over top, add few tablespoons reserved pasta water if sauce feels too thick. Stir briskly to coat evenly, checking for pesto balance – it should present fragrant herbal aroma without overwhelming basil bitterness."
- "Divide pasta among bowls. Arrange chicken strips on top, scatter tomato and burrata medley. Sprinkle torn basil leaves for fragrance and freshness if desired. Serve immediately."
- "Store leftovers separately if possible to keep burrata texture intact. Microwave gently or warm skillet for reheating chicken and pasta."
introduction: "Start with a handful of ripe grape tomatoes, their candy-sweet burst already hinting at summer’s best. Burrata replaces bocconcini here; richer, creamier, providing a luscious counterpoint to the herbal punch of pesto. Macaroni - elbow or small tube - carries the sauce well without drowning in it. Chicken breasts get the once-over in a smoking-hot pan to seal juices and build that nutty crust. Lemon juice and olive oil wake up the tomatoes, tender but still alive with brightness. Toss macaronis just off boil, saving that starchy pasta water for moments when the sauce needs loosening up - a technique to remember. Plates come together hot and cold, textures sharp and smooth, vibrant and earthy."
ingredientsNote: "Switched bocconcini to burrata for richer creaminess; more luxurious mouthfeel without sacrificing mildness. Grape tomatoes in place of cherry tomatoes - skin thinner, sweeter, tender flesh. Adjust oil quantities accordingly; extra virgin preferred though light olive oil works if budget pressed. Fresh lemon juice sharpens acidity but fresh squeezing needed over bottled for brightness. Macaroni preferred over macaronis as it holds pesto pools internally, unlike long pasta. Chicken breasts flattened slightly to ensure even cooking, but not pounded to mush. Basil optional – fresh torn leaves elevate aroma tremendously but fresh herbs decline in storage, add just before serving. Salt and freshly ground pepper—don't skip. Effective seasoning is straightforward but pivotal to the final complexity."
instructionsNote: "Tomatoes in acid and oil soften gently at room temp; cuts down fridge condensation and flavor dulling. Burrata tore naturally into bite-sized pieces, careful handling preserves creamy interiors. Macaroni cooking requires attention - vigorous boiling and early taste tests indicate ideal doneness. Overcooked pasta ruins texture, undercooked is unforgivable. Heat management crucial for chicken - too low and no browning, too high and burning without inside cook-through. Rest poultry 5 minutes for juices to redistribute – no throwing on plates immediately. Mixing pesto into piping hot pasta avoids clumping but use leftover pasta water to thin sauce if too dense. Assembly into bowls, not tossing completely avoids bruising burrata. Basil gives a herbal perfumed finish; add late to preserve volatile oils. Leftovers heat unevenly; best served fresh but gently warmed with splash of water or drizzle oil."
tips:
- "For chicken, rest after cooking. Critical for juices to settle. Too hot, you lose moisture. Use a hot pan, sear through. Aim for golden crust. Not soggy."
- "Macaroni should not stick. Stir immediately in boiling water. Check doneness often. Al dente for bite. Reserve pasta water, that helps with sauce if thick."
- "Grape tomatoes burst with flavor. Toss with lemon juice, olive oil. Room temp softens them. Essential for freshness. Don't skip seasoning. Use sea salt & fresh pepper."
- "Pesto balance is key. Mix into hot pasta. Avoid clumps and bitterness. Thin with pasta water if needed. Test frequently. Pesto should be fragrant, not overpowering."
- "Burrata is delicate. Handle gently. Tear before mixing in to preserve creaminess. Last-minute addition serves the best texture contrast. Add fresh basil for aroma."

faq:
- "q: What if my chicken is dry? a: Adjust cooking time. Chicken rests, juices redistribute. A pan too hot makes it burn outside. You want golden not scorched."
- "q: What can I use instead of burrata? a: Try ricotta or mozzarella. Each brings a different texture. Both won't give same creaminess you get."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Separate components. Keep burrata intact. Chicken and pasta together. Reheat gently in pan, splash water helps even heating."
- "q: Tomatoes not sweet? a: Don't use subpar tomatoes. Look for ripe grape. Always taste! Adjust acidity with more lemon. Consider adding honey or balsamic."
