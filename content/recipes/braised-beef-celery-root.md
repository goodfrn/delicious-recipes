ingredients:
- "900 g boneless beef chuck roast"
- "50 ml olive oil divided"
- "2 medium shallots finely chopped"
- "3 cloves garlic minced"
- "340 ml dry white wine or chicken stock"
- "1 medium celery root peeled and cubed"
- "3 celery stalks cut in 2.5 cm pieces"
- "2 tbsp chopped fresh chives"
- "30 ml finely chopped dried tart cherries optional"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Set oven rack mid-level preheat oven to 175 C. Sound of the oven warming fills kitchen."
- "Heat half the oil in heavy ovenproof pot over medium-high. When oil shimmers, brown roast on all sides. Should have deep mahogany crust. Don’t crowd the pan. Salty, peppery crust seals juices. Remove meat, rest briefly."
- "Add shallots to same pot. Stir, hear soft sizzle as they soften and sweeten, about 4 minutes. Toss in garlic, cook 1 minute until fragrant but not burnt."
- "Return beef to pot. Pour wine, scraping bits stuck to bottom. Liquid near bubbling but not roaring boil—edges shimmer. Cover tightly, transfer to oven. Braise for 1 hour 40 minutes."
- "Meanwhile, in separate pan, heat remaining oil to medium-high. Add celery root and stalks, sprinkle salt and pepper. Toss occasionally until golden and fragrant, edges caramelized but veggies still hold shape, about 12 minutes."
- "Remove roast from oven. Surround meat with sautéed celery mixture. Cover again, back in oven for another 30 minutes. Meat should feel tender to poke with finger but still sliceable. Aroma rich, earthy with hints of wine and garlic."
- "Stir in fresh chives and tart cherries. Taste sauce, adjust salt and pepper if needed. Use spoon to moisten meat with cooking liquid; glossy, fragrant, slightly thickened."
- "Slice beef across grain, serve with your choice of rustic mashed potatoes or parsnip puree, spooning plenty of braising juices and veggies on top."
introduction: "Braised beef with celery, but done differently. Chuck roast, not lean, carries flavor under long heat. Separating celery root and stalk offers two points of texture—earthy cream and crunch. Swap cider for dry white wine; acidity steadies richness, no sugar bump. Shallots instead of onions cut sharpness, garlic turns aromatic but controlled. Oven cooking covered traps moisture, develops tenderness evenly. Last-minute chives boost freshness, dried tart cherries add acid bite, counterbalance the heavy meat. Visual, tactile doneness beats clocks. Smell soulful aroma of garlic and wine. Poke beef, it yields but holds together. This is slow cooking with precision, no shortcuts. Practical and rewarding."
ingredientsNote: "Chuck roast preferred for marbling and connective tissue. No wine? Use chicken broth but add a splash of vinegar or lemon juice to mimic acidity. Celery root and stalk combo essential—celery root alone cooks mushy; stalks add bite. Dried tart cherries replaced cranberries here for sharper flavor; substitute with raisins soaked in brandy if unavailable. Shallots offer subtle sweetness and less pungency than onions; reduce if swapping back. Olive oil adequate for searing and sauté, no need for butter which can burn at these temperatures. Season in layers—undersalt and meat tough. Fresh herbs last step avoid losing aroma during long braise."
instructionsNote: "Sear meat on high heat to lock flavors, don’t rush. Fond buildup on pan bottom boosts taste when deglazed with wine. Medium heat for shallots prevents bitterness, garlic only added at end lest it burn. Wine added cold to lift pan bits, not boiling hard to avoid bitter reduction. Keep covered during oven braise to maintain moisture, no peeking except last 40 minutes to add veggies. Pan-searing celery root and stalk separately ensures texture contrast—don’t toss raw veg in pot at start or they turn to mush. Timing flexible; check meat resistance with finger or fork, it should feel tender but intact. Adding delicate herbs and dried fruit last retains aroma and sharp acidic brightness. Serve immediately with thick mashed root vegetables to catch juices."
tips:
- "Use a trusty pot; cast iron works great; retains heat well. Browning beef? High heat essential. Get that crust—deep browning develops flavor."
- "Watch your shallots; they can turn bitter quickly. Add garlic near end of cooking. Helps aroma but control cooking to avoid burning."
- "For celery, keep it crisp. Cook until golden but not mushy. Caramelizing brings out sweetness. Texture contrast is key."
- "Wine choice matters; don’t skimp—flavor depth increases. No white wine? Use broth but add vinegar for acidity. Acid cuts richness."
- "Cherries add tartness; swap with cranberries if necessary but different taste. Use raisins soaked in brandy as a plan B."
faq:
- "q: Best way to tell if meat is done? a: Poke beef gently. Tender but not falling apart. Visual cues; color remains bright."
- "q: Can I use onion instead of shallots? a: Yes, but cut back to avoid overpowering flavor. Shallots bring milder sweetness."
- "q: What if my beef is tough? a: Make sure to braise long enough. Check internal temperature. Should feel tender, not shredded."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool completely. Store in airtight container fridge. Reheat gently to maintain moisture; avoid overcooking."
