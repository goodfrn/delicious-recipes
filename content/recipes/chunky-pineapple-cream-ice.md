title: "Chunky Pineapple Cream Ice"
slug: "chunky-pineapple-cream-ice"
description: "Ice cream made without a custard base. Whipping cream folded into sweetened condensed milk and tropical fruit for texture and flavor. Uses chopped pineapple instead of mango. Added a pinch of cardamom powder for a warming twist. Folding technique keeps whipped cream light and airy. Freeze uncovered first to firm up layers, then top fruit pressed in before final covered freeze. Results in scoopable texture without ice crystals if whipped cream is stiff enough and folding is gentle. Substitute coconut milk for cream to lighten dairy load. Avoid overmixing or ice cream turns dense and icy. A reliable no-churn dessert for hot kitchens or no-ice-cream-maker days."

ingredients:
- "5 ounces sweetened condensed milk"
- "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract"
- "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt"
- "2 1/4 cups heavy cream cold"
- "2 cups fresh pineapple finely chopped"
- "1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom"
instructions:
- "In a large mixing bowl, whisk together sweetened condensed milk, vanilla, salt, and cardamom until smooth and aromatic."
- "In a separate chilled bowl, with a stand mixer or electric hand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat cold heavy cream on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form. Watch carefully. Whipped cream should hold shape and not tilt when the bowl is inverted."
- "Reserve roughly 20 percent of the chopped pineapple for garnish. Fold remaining pineapple bits gently into the sweetened condensed milk mix in batches, using a silicone spatula and a light swirling motion to keep air in."
- "Carefully fold whipped cream into the condensed milk and pineapple mixture in three increments. Avoid deflating the cream. Clumps okay. The goal: light, airy base studded with fruit."
- "Pour the blend into a lightly greased 9x5x3 bread pan. Smooth top with an offset spatula. Leave uncovered, place in freezer for 2 hours or until mixture firms but not rock solid. You'll notice edges developing a frosty crust and center solidifying when gently pressed with a finger."
- "Pull from freezer. Press reserved pineapple evenly over the surface, gently embedding chunks without breaking the surface tension. Fruit should remain visible on top for texture contrast."
- "Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil to prevent ice crystals from forming and freezer odors from seeping in. Return to the freezer for 10 to 14 hours. Check at 10-hour mark if you prefer softer scoopability."
- "Remove from freezer 10-15 minutes before scooping. Handles knife or spoon to loosen edges if needed. Scoop out thick, creamy portions. Fruit on top adds fresh bite and can be mixed in per serving."
- "Dish out and serve immediately. Keeps well up to 5 days frozen but expect some ice crystal formation after extended storage."
- "If dairy allergy: try canned full-fat coconut milk whipped thick instead of cream—beat long for stiffness. Sweetened condensed coconut milk works but is rare; replace with condensed oat milk and add more vanilla."
- "If ice cream hardens too much: thaw 5 minutes at room temp before scooping to bring back creaminess."
introduction: "No custard, no fuss. Starting with sweetened condensed milk—dense, saccharine, and thick—adds sugar and creaminess in one swoop. Vanilla and sea salt set a rounded base, balancing sweet and flavor. Cardamom, a bold choice, gives unexpected warmth and floral notes, a subtle exotic kick. Whipped cream, properly stiff, incorporated carefully, creates volume and softness, nothing dense or icy. Pineapple swaps mango as the fruit star—acidic, firm, and juicy with a tropical brightness. Folding steps are non-negotiable—be gentle, or ice cream will fall flat and icy. Freezing uncovered first firms the mixture, making a better surface to add remaining pineapple chunks, letting fruit sit on top instead of sinking. Long covered freeze transforms soft mixture into scoopable frozen delight. Simple ingredients combine into refined texture and refreshing flavor. No ice cream machine, no problem."
ingredientsNote: "Sweetened condensed milk plays double duty here. It provides all the sugar and creaminess without having to add granulated sugar separately. Vanilla extract adds depth; avoid artificial imitations for best aroma. Sea salt is subtle but necessary—it cuts sweetness and rounds flavors. Cardamom is optional but recommended—ground finely to avoid gritty bits. Heavy cream must be very cold, ideally chilled several hours before whipping. Cold cream whips better and holds air, creating that light yet creamy texture that keeps ice cream from freezing rock hard. Fresh pineapple should be ripe but firm to maintain bite after freezing. If can't find fresh, frozen defrosted pineapple works but drain juices thoroughly to prevent excess water leveling out creaminess. Substitute coconut cream for dairy—chilled and whipped until peaks—but texture becomes denser. Watch for sweetness adjustment if using alternative milks because they're less sweet than condensed milk."
instructionsNote: "Step one: mixing condensed milk with vanilla, salt, and cardamom—aim for smooth and uniform mixture. Step two: whip cream to stiff peaks but stop just before it looks grainy or buttery. Overwhipping leads to separation, ruining texture. Step three: folding fruit into condensed milk first—not whipped cream—keeps fruit evenly distributed and reduces pressure on cream in later step. Step four: multiple gentle foldings of whipped cream used to maintain airy base. Use spatula, with cut-and-fold motions; avoid stirring or beating. Step five: freeze uncovered initially to set texture and reduce moisture accumulation on surface—frosty edges signal ready. Step six: pressing remaining fruit on top adds bursts of fresh flavor and varied textures after freezing. Step seven: covering tight completes freezing and protects flavor integrity. Step eight: letting ice cream temper slightly before scooping is key—too cold and hard scoops tear surface and result in icy bits. Remember, timing is flexible—use visual and tactile cues over strict minutes. Real kitchens vary freezer strength and ingredient temperature, so calibrate with touch and look."
tips:
- "Using chilled bowls and utensils keeps whipped cream stiffer. Can’t stress that enough. Warm tools will ruin that airy structure. Go for cold bottled containers and beaters too."
- "When folding, cut through mixtures gently. Too much stirring deflates air from whipped cream. Don’t get impatient. Think slow and steady. Watch for lumps that just add charm."
- "For sweetness balance, add a squeeze of lime after mixing. Really shines against the creamy base. Try adding coconut flakes for texture. Super nice little chew."
- "Smooth the mixture, but not obsessively. Gently smoothing the top makes surface ready for fruit. But too much can burst bubbles – keep those air pockets."
- "When covering for freezing, avoid touching the ice cream. Air pockets cause ice and a frosty texture. Use plastic wrap for a tighter seal before aluminum foil. Keep flavor and texture."
faq:
- "q: Can I use other fruits? a: Sure thing! Strawberries work great; just chop fine. Peaches too—but be careful; adjust sugar. Frozen fruits need draining."
- "q: How can I avoid icy bits? a: Let it sit at room temp for a few minutes before serving. Softening helps with scoopability. Too cold means hard pulls."
- "q: What if my ice cream doesn't freeze well? a: Increase folding time. Or, check cream's stiffness. Mustn’t be loose. Warm cream won’t whip right. Adjust technique."
- "q: Storage tips for leftovers? a: Store in airtight containers. Limit air contact. Use parchment paper under lid. Keeps flavors longer. Consume within five days."
