slug: "honey-candied-walnut-shrimp"
description: "Crunchy walnuts coated in caramelized sugar. Crisp shrimp fried in a frothy rice flour batter. Honey sauce rich with mayo, sweetened condensed milk, lemon juice. Balanced sweetness, light acidity. Subtle crunch from candied nuts. Shrimp tender inside, golden outside. Easy mod: swap canola oil for peanut or avocado oil for depth. Use tapioca starch instead of rice flour for lighter crunch. Timing hinges on visual cues not clocks. Avoid stirring sugar syrup early to dodge grainy walnuts. The sauce binds everything with a creamy, sticky glaze. Garnished with scallions for sharpness and color. Quick, reliable, no-fail in a home or pro kitchen."

ingredients:
- "1/4 cup water"
- "1/2 cup granulated sugar"
- "3/4 cup walnuts, halves"
- "1/3 cup mayonnaise"
- "3 tablespoons honey"
- "3 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk"
- "1 1/2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice"
- "1 pound large shrimp, peeled, deveined, tails on"
- "1/3 cup liquid egg whites"
- "1/3 to 1/2 cup rice flour (can swap tapioca starch)"
- "4 cups peanut oil (or canola for neutral)"
- "2 scallions, thinly sliced"
instructions:
- "Start with sugar syrup for the walnuts: Combine water and sugar in medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Don't stir as sugar melts. Watch closely; syrup should bubble steadily but not burn. Wait for sugar to fully dissolve before adding nuts. Grainy syrup means stirring was too soon or impurities entered."
- "Add walnuts directly to syrup. Stir gently with wooden spoon to coat evenly. Let bubble gently for 6–7 minutes. Watch for syrup thickening, nuts glossy and sticky. Remove using slotted spoon onto parchment-lined tray. Spread nuts out in single layer. Let cool undisturbed until firm and crisp."
- "Mix sauce while nuts dry: Blend mayo, honey, condensed milk, lemon juice vigorously. Must be silky, fully combined without lumps. Lemon juice brightens fat-heavy sauce; don't skip."
- "Heat oil in heavy pot or deep fryer to roughly 370°F. Use thermometer for accuracy; oil too cool means greasy shrimp, too hot burns exterior. Peanut oil adds nuttier flavor, better smoke point."
- "Whip egg whites in bowl with whisk 2–3 minutes until frothy and airy. Sift in rice flour gradually while whisking until batter resembles thick pancake batter. Adjust flour quantity; batter too thin won’t cling. Tapioca starch swap makes lighter crust."
- "Pat shrimp dry with paper towels completely. Moisture kills batter adhesion."
- "Coat shrimp in batter one by one. Drop carefully into hot oil; avoid overcrowding. Fry 3–4 minutes per batch until light golden and shrimp curl tightly. Listen for steady bubbling; if bubbles slow, oil cools, raise temp. Remove shrimp onto paper towels to drain excess oil."
- "Combine fried shrimp and candied walnuts in large bowl. Pour honey sauce over immediately. Toss gently so sauce evenly coats everything without breaking shrimp crust or crushing nuts."
- "Transfer to serving dish. Garnish generously with sliced scallions for fresh bite and color contrast."
introduction: "Sticky sweet walnuts caramelized over heat. Shrimp fried until just golden, bathed in a thick, creamy honey sauce. Mayonnaise and condensed milk merge into a tangy-sweet coating. Lemon juice cuts richness, balances heaviness. The nuts crackle under a glossy sugar shell. Shrimp stay juicy inside a crisp batter. This demands timing and temperature precision, but the payoff holds. Swap peanut oil for richer aroma or tapioca starch for different crunch. Whipping whites until frothy traps air, creates lighter batter. Sugar syrup that cooks undisturbed prevents crystallization and gritty texture. The final toss melds textures and flavors—sticky, crunchy, tender. Scallion garnish adds a final fresh snap. Not fuss, just focused techniques, reliable, proven. No waste, no guesswork."
ingredientsNote: "Water and granulated sugar form the candied walnut base. No stirring early to avoid crystallization—let syrup develop clear gloss. Walnuts are traditional but pecans or almonds can work, though texture changes. Mayonnaise adds richness and tang; Greek yogurt or creme fraiche can swap but alter flavor. Condensed milk is key for sweetness, consider evaporated milk with added sugar if needed. Lemon juice brightens the sauce by cutting fat. Rice flour binds the batter; tapioca starch for lighter crunch and chew. Liquid egg whites whipped aerate batter, giving light, airy crust. Canola oil neutral, peanut oil lends nuttiness and smoky aroma—choose based on pantry and flavor preference. Scallions bright, crunchy, garnish contrast. Dry shrimp well so batter sticks without sliding."
instructionsNote: "Sugar syrup demands patience. Wait for bubbles, clear syrup before adding nuts to avoid grainy texture. Nuts caramelize slowly; watch color and texture, don't rush. Removing nuts with slotted spoon lets excess syrup drip and prevents clumping. Sauce mixing must be thorough; lumps in mayo cause uneven coating. Oil temperature crucial—too low means greasy, soggy shrimp; too hot burns exterior and leaves shrimp raw. Whipping egg whites should be frothy, not stiff peaks, to keep batter light. Batter thickness adjusted visually, should coat shrimp well but not drip off. Fry shrimp individually or in small batches for even cooking and crispiness. Drain well to avoid oily final dish. Tossing with sauce while shrimp warm ensures sauce clings perfectly. Garnish last to preserve scallion crunch and color. Timing of each step overlaps for efficiency—candied nuts drying while sauce readied, shrimp frying last to retain heat and crispness."
tips:
- "Watch the sugar syrup closely. It must bubble steadily—not burn. Patience is key. Too early to stir? Crystal mess! Let it develop a clear gloss."
- "For crispy shrimp, ensure oil is hot. Around 370°F; use a thermometer. Oil too cool? Grease on shrimp. Too hot? Burns outside; raw inside."
- "Ditch excess moisture from shrimp. Pat dry; moisture slips batter. Even coats stick better, and fry lighter. Crust will just cling without sliding."
- "Adjust batter thickness visually. Start with 1/3 cup rice flour; too thin? Not clingy enough. Tapioca starch adds crunch; plays well."
- "Garnish last with scallions. Preserve crispness and color. Toss just warm shrimp and nuts in sauce; it clings best when warm, not cold."
faq:
- "q: What to do if candied walnuts turn grainy? a: If syrup crystallizes, missed early stages. No stirring! Must wait for syrup's visual cues. If bad, start over."
- "q: Can I use other nuts? a: Sure! Pecans or almonds can swap for walnuts. Texture alters; also flavors shift slightly. Keep eye on timing for success."
- "q: Shrimp not crispy? a: Check oil temp; keep it consistent. May also need better drying before battering. Fry in smaller batches for even heat."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Place shrimp, nuts in fridge in airtight. Best to reheat in oven to keep crispiness. Eating cold? Not great!"
