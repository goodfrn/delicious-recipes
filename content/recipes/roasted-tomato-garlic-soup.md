ingredients:
- "1 head garlic, top sliced to expose cloves"
- "600 g (1.3 lb) Roma tomatoes, quartered"
- "2 shallots, thinly sliced"
- "3 tablespoons olive oil, plus extra to drizzle"
- "3 tablespoons harissa paste"
- "750 ml (3 cups) hot vegetable broth"
- "180 ml (¾ cup) coconut cream"
- "Fresh thyme leaves, for garnish (optional)"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 200° C (390° F). Position oven rack center."
- "Arrange garlic head, tomatoes, shallots, olive oil, and harissa in an ovenproof pot or Dutch oven. Season with salt and pepper, toss to coat."
- "Roast uncovered 50 minutes, until garlic softens and tomatoes caramelize slightly."
- "Remove pot from oven. Let garlic rest 8 minutes. Squeeze cloves out, discard skins."
- "Add roasted garlic back into pot. Blend with immersion blender until silky smooth."
- "Slowly pour in broth and coconut cream, stir well. Adjust salt and pepper to taste."
- "Optionally strain puree through sieve for extra smoothness."
- "Warm soup gently on stovetop if needed before serving."
- "Ladle into bowls. Drizzle more olive oil over top. Garnish with thyme leaves."
- "Serve alongside toasted baguette or spicy cheese sandwich."
introduction: "Garlic and tomatoes, slow roasted. Deep scents fill the kitchen. Shallots take caramelized turns, roasted red peppers slip in for sweetness. Harissa adds smoky heat not overpowering but clear. Puree thick but not heavy. Coconut cream cools and rounds, no dairy needed. A few thyme leaves freshen at the end. No basil here. Warm, rustic, easy to make. Great as light meal or first course. Piping hot from stove or the next day, flavors have settled. A simple toast on the side or cheese sandwich, ideal partners. Rushed days or slow evenings."
ingredientsNote: "Garlic head sliced but left whole for roasting, softens to buttery texture. Roma tomatoes preferred for their fleshiness and fewer seeds. Shallots swap for red onions to add milder sweetness after roasting. Harissa paste replaces tomato paste bringing smoky depth with gentle heat. Olive oil crucial both for roasting and finishing drizzle. Coconut cream used instead of dairy cream, subtle flavor difference, great for lactose intolerance. Vegetable broth makes this vegan-friendly. Thyme leaves used for herbal lift instead of basil traditionally paired."
instructionsNote: "Oven preheated to slightly higher 200° C to speed roasting, time shortened to 50 minutes. Roast tomatoes and garlic in covered Dutch oven to intensify flavors and keep moisture but uncovered for light caramelization on top. Rest garlic briefly to cool and make pressing easier. Immersion blender yields finest texture but regular blender okay in batches. Adjust seasoning after blending, salt helps bring out sweetness. Passing through sieve optional but recommended for ultra smooth finish. Warm slowly to avoid separating coconut cream. Serve drizzled with olive oil for extra silkiness and fresh thyme for aroma."
tips:
- "Choose Roma tomatoes for best results. Fleshy texture helps create body in soup. Fresh garlic is key for deep flavor. Roasting garlic softens it. Wait for those cloves to cool a bit before squeezing out."
- "Immersion blender makes for silky smooth soup. But if regular blender used, blend in batches. Watch for splattering. Adjust salt after blending. It brings out natural sweetness of tomatoes."
- "Option to strain the soup for smoothness. Sieve catches any bits. Extra step adds a little more time. Wind up with velvety texture. Taste testers will appreciate."
- "Coconut cream gives richness. Non-dairy yet creamy. Stir slowly when adding to avoid separation. Warm slowly on stove. No direct heat. Maintain creaminess."
- "Garnish with fresh thyme for aroma. Adds a nice herbal note. Drizzle of olive oil on top enhances flavor. Toasted baguette pairs well. Spicy cheese sandwich makes a perfect side."
faq:
- "q: How to reheat soup? a: Gently warm on stovetop, avoid boiling. Stir regularly. Keeps coconut cream in check. Great flavors meld overnight too."
- "q: Can I use different veggies? a: Sure, red peppers add sweetness. Zucchini could work too. Just keep roasting time in mind. Texture matters."
- "q: What's the best way to store leftovers? a: Cool down first. Airtight container, fridge is ideal. Should last three days. Can freeze too, but watch flavor."
- "q: What to do if soup is too thick? a: Gradually add more broth. Stir as you go. Fix texture easily. Balancing is crucial."
