ingredients:
- "=== Dough ==="
- "120 g (3/4 cup plus 1 tbsp) unbleached all-purpose flour"
- "8 ml (1 1/2 tsp) sugar"
- "2 ml (1/3 tsp) instant yeast"
- "3 ml (1/2 tsp) fine sea salt"
- "100 ml (7 tbsp) warm water"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) olive oil"
- "=== Topping ==="
- "1/3 white onion, thinly sliced"
- "70 ml (1/4 cup plus 1 tbsp) creme fraiche"
- "20 ml (1 tbsp plus 1 tsp) grainy mustard, plus extra"
- "200 g smoked meat, torn into bite-size pieces"
- "30 g (3 tbsp) quick pickled jalapeño slices"
- "Fresh cracked black pepper"
instructions:
- "=== Dough Preparation ==="
- "Mix the flour, sugar, sea salt, and instant yeast in a large bowl. Add warm water and olive oil, stir until shaggy dough forms. Flour surface lightly, knead about 7 minutes by hand or use a stand mixer with dough hook on low speed till smooth but still slightly tacky. Dough should spring back gently when poked."
- "Shape dough into a tight ball. Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with clean damp towel. Let rest in warm spot 60-90 minutes, until nearly doubled but not overproofed. Watch volume, finger dent should fill slowly not vanish immediately."
- "=== Onion Prep ==="
- "Thinly slice onion, cover with cold water in bowl for 45-60 minutes to blunt sharp bite. Drain and pat dry. This reduces harsh sulfur notes without removing texture or color."
- "=== Sauce and Assembly ==="
- "Combine creme fraiche with grainy mustard, stir well to integrate completely. This creamy-mustard base replaces tomato sauce—keeps pizza light and tangy."
- "Lightly flour parchment paper, stretch dough out with hands or rolling pin to 30 cm (12 inch) diameter disc. Spread mustard creme evenly over surface leaving a small border. Scatter drained onions, then distribute smoked meat pieces evenly. No need for too much topping; balance is key to avoid soggy bottom."
- "Scatter pickled jalapeño rounds last to keep vibrant and tart."
- "Crack fresh black pepper over top."
- "=== Cooking on Grill ==="
- "Heat pizza stone on hot barbecue grate, covered, aiming for steady 230-260°C (450-500°F). Preheat 20-30 minutes; stone must be scorching to prevent dough from sticking and ensure quick bake."
- "Transfer assembled pizza with parchment onto hot stone. Close grill lid immediately. Bake 12-15 minutes. Watch for crust edges turning golden brown with blistered spots. Cheese-like cream will bubble and edges slightly charred but not burnt. If crust edge is doughy after 15 minutes, increase heat slightly or rotate pizza halfway through cooking for even browning."
- "Remove pizza by sliding parchment carefully. Top with extra grainy mustard and jalapeño slices if desired. Let rest 2-3 minutes before slicing for easier cutting and set filling textures."
- "Serve hot, spoon knife through crust for crisp crunch and mix of creamy, smoky, tart flavors."
- "==="
- "Backups and Troubleshooting: If dough overproofs, punch down and reshape, it will be denser but still tasty. For soggy crust, ensure pizza stone is hot before placing dough. Use parchment to slide pizza on/off avoids tearing. Smoked meat can be substituted with shredded smoked brisket or even smoked turkey breast for a leaner option; just adjust seasoning accordingly."
- "More heat? Swap jalapeños with pickled fresnos or add sliced serrano peppers right before serving."
- "If no stone, use inverted heavy baking sheet inside grill but reduce baking time slightly; bottom won’t crisp as well."
- "Always check dough elasticity during knead—too much flour leads to dry crust; too little, sticky mess."
- "Remember to bench rest dough properly for gluten structure and easy shaping. A warm moist resting environment encourages even yeast activity without drying the surface."
- "Poking the crust should give a firm bounce back with slight spring, not collapse or harden instantly—signals ready structure."
- "Adding olive oil to dough makes crust flexible, slightly richer and browns better under high heat. Don’t skip this."
- "Keep onions thin and soaked or raw onion bites will dominate the profile, overpower others."
- "Cream and grainy mustard mixture spreads easily, maintains moisture without sogginess. Reduces chance of burnt sauce spots."
- "Smoking aromas will blend with beer or wood smoke from the grill. Close lid immediately after placing pizza prevents heat loss and uneven cooking."
- "Overall it's a marriage of textures and flavors—smoked meat’s chew, creamy tang, sharp onion bite tempered by pickles, crisp charred crust."
- "Master visual doneness cues: golden bubbly edges, slight blistering, sturdiness when lifting crust edge little bounce back. Tactile senses guide timing better than clock. The subtle snap when breaking bite confirms balanced bake."
introduction: "First—the dough. Smaller amount, less yeast, slightly thicker crust but with more chew. Not that bubble-gum nonsense but substance. No heavy rise, no mess. Mustard and creme fraiche replace tomato sauce to keep things fresh and tangy. Smoked meat chunks, no shredded paste. The onion’s soaked and tamed, a good trick against harshness. Barbecue stone loaded and screaming hot. Close the lid quick, trap that heat, get crust blistered but within 12-15 minutes. Watch the edges—golden, bubbly, smelling of smoke and crisp char, hint of mustard bite. These aren’t softer pizzas; crust must snap with a clean break. Jalapeños pick up the slack where cornichons failed—heat and tartness juice the thing alive. The whole builds in layers; cream softens smoked chew; zest cuts through fat. Timing is fingers and eyes; no strict reliance on clock. Done right, this pizza rolls with the seasons and the smoke, not just the textbook."
ingredientsNote: "Flour amount and yeast are scaled back for density and control because too much yeast creates a yeasty overproof—or worse, a crust that collapses. Adding olive oil gives flexibility and color to the dough—don’t skip it or risk a pale crust. Instant yeast over active dry; no proofing needed saves time and removes guesswork. Onion soaking tames the bite, critical here because raw white onion can ruin the balance if too harsh. Creme fraiche works better than sour cream or heavy cream for spreadability and tang without wet sogginess. Grainy mustard adds a textured sharpness missing in smooth Dijon—you want those mustard seeds popping subtly under tooth. Pickled jalapeños replace cornichons to add a spicy spark rather than just acidity. Smoked meat replacement suggestions include shredded brisket or smoked turkey breast—both require minimal seasoning adjustments but greatly impact texture. Always use parchment paper for easy transfer onto the hot stone or grill. No stone? Upside down cast iron skillet or heavy tray will work but adjust cooking time and keep direct heat high."
instructionsNote: "Kneading is tactile: dough should tighten up, smooth out, feel slightly tacky but not sticky—too sticky means add flour slowly, a little at a time. Let dough rest in warm, humid spot—under a damp towel is easiest—prevents crust drying and creates nice gluten network. Dough volume should nearly double; poke with finger—slow fill back; instant erase means overproof. Onion soaking is critical; a minimum of 45 minutes softens harshness and reduces bite. The mustard-creme mixture must be well mixed and evenly spread; thick blobs will char or undercook. Stretch dough gently to avoid tearing and keep edge border intact to develop crisp lip. Preheat stone for 20-30 minutes at max grill heat; stone must be hot enough to sizzle a drop of water. Baking on the grill demands frequent visual checks; if heat fluctuates, rotate pizza halfway to brown evenly. Remove pizza once edges crisp and bubble, crust golden with dark spots but no burning. Rest pizza 2-3 minutes to allow toppings to settle and filling to thicken slightly for clean slices. Use extra mustard and jalapeños to add brightness at service. Backup; if crust undercooked after time, increase heat rather than bake longer—wet dough ruins texture. Parchment prevents stick and burns less, do not skip. Practice recognizing visual and tactile cues above all."
tips:
- "For dough, control moisture—less water, less yeast. Stretch it out properly. Don’t rush. Elasticity matters. Room temperature for easier shaping."
- "Onions—after soaking, dry them. Too wet, and you'll ruin the crust. Quick pickle jalapeños. Add zest. Balance heat and tang on top."
- "Hot pizza stone is critical. Don't skip preheating. This gives a crust that snaps. If using a baking sheet, adjust the cook time carefully."
- "Visual cues—golden edges, bubbling cream on top, aroma of smoke—this tells you when it's done. Check often, avoid burning."
- "Rest the pizza post-cook or it'll be a mess to cut. A couple minutes lets cheese set. Develop flavors. Serve hot and fresh."
