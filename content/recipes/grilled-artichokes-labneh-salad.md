ingredients:
- "278 ml (9.5 oz) canned artichoke hearts in water rinsed and drained"
- "80 ml (5 tbsp) olive oil"
- "65 ml (4.5 tbsp) labneh"
- "278 ml (9.5 oz) canned lima beans rinsed and drained"
- "1 small shallot finely chopped"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) chopped fresh dill"
- "20 ml (1.3 tbsp) fresh lemon juice"
instructions:
- "Heat grill to high. Oil grill grates lightly."
- "Toss artichokes with 12 ml (0.8 tbsp) olive oil. Grill 3 minutes per side until grill marks appear. Remove and cool slightly on plate."
- "Stir labneh in small bowl with pinch salt and pepper. Set aside."
- "Combine lima beans, shallot, dill, lemon juice, and remaining olive oil in bowl. Season with salt and pepper."
- "Fill grilled artichokes with labneh. Arrange on shallow serving dish."
- "Pile the lima bean salad atop the artichokes. Spoon remaining salad around plate."
- "Serve warm or at room temperature."
introduction: "Artichokes take a smoky spin here. Charred just long enough for flavor, not mush. Labneh whipped up and salted. Blend that with a creamy bean salad—soft lima beans mixed with onions, dill, and citrus. Not your usual combo but nails freshness and lightness. Quick and vegetarian friendly. No nuts, no dairy beyond labneh which is strained yogurt, no eggs, no gluten. Grill preheated hot to stay sharp and fast. Beans bring texture, herbs bring brightness. Lemon adds zip. Mix and match, toss with oil for richness. Simple ingredients turned into a dish that pulls together. Eat as is or with crusty bread if that suits you. "
ingredientsNote: "Quantities shifted down about 30 percent to keep it balanced for smaller servings. Olive oil slightly increased for more coating and grilling moisture. Labneh reduced to keep richness but avoid heaviness. Lima beans pared down accordingly. Shallot and dill intact for balance, lemon juice slightly decreased but enough to pop brightness. Artichokes swapped from 398 ml to 278 ml cans to follow quantity drop. Oil split for grilling and salad dressing. Ingredients remain vegetarian, gluten-free, lactose-free except labneh, and nut-free. The labneh can be replaced with thick Greek yogurt if desired but would alter texture slightly. Dill and lemon keep flavors fresh and light."
instructionsNote: "Grill time bumped up by a bit—3 minutes each side versus 2—for better caramelization and slight charring. Oil grill grates to prevent sticking. Labneh mixed with salt and pepper to taste, don’t overdo it. Combine bean salad ingredients in a bowl and toss gently but thoroughly. Fill grilled artichokes with labneh using a spoon for even distribution. Arrange on plate before topping with bean salad to keep presentation neat. Any leftover bean salad divides around artichokes for balance. Serve immediately warm or let cool to room temp. Adjust seasoning after assembling based on taste. Keep steps short to encourage action and prevent waiting. Times approximate but useful for timing progression."
tips:
- "Grill at high heat. Get those marks. Don’t overdo it though. Oil the grates first. It helps prevent sticking. Use a brush for even coverage. Control that flame. Want char without burning. Flip carefully. Oil artichokes to keep moist. Brush after flipping too."
- "Layer flavors. Labneh needs salt. Mix it with pepper. Adjust as needed. Bean salad brightens everything. More lemon? Consider it. Shallots add crunch. Dill gives freshness. Combine well. Gentle toss. Not too rough, it breaks beans."
- "Serve warm or room temp. It works either way. Keep artichokes on a plate. Drizzle olive oil on top. Adds richness. Leftover salad? Good side for anything. Great with bread too. Balance strong flavors. Use crusty bread for dipping."
- "Prep fast and keep it quick. Time management is key. Finish grilling then assemble. Cool artichokes slightly. Don’t let them sit too long. Keep moving through steps. Stay organized. Can mix ingredients while grilling. Capitalize on cooking time."
- "Presentation matters. Arrange artichokes neatly. Bean salad on top looks clean. Scattered extras around plate. It adds appeal. Colors pop. Use a shallow dish for depth. Helps stack ingredients delicately. Visuals are important too."
faq:
- "q: How do I choose artichokes? a: Look for firm, tight leaves. No brown spots. Freshness is key. You want good quality. Can use canned. Just rinse thoroughly first."
- "q: Can I prep ahead? a: Yes, chop salad early. Keep separate though. Don’t mix until ready to serve. Labneh can sit but covered. Flavors blend if mixed too soon."
- "q: What if I don’t have labneh? a: Use Greek yogurt. Texture changes a bit. But still creamy. Or use sour cream for different taste. Adjust seasoning."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cover and chill in fridge. Eat within a day. Artichokes might get soggy. Better fresh but still good cold. Reheat gently in oven."
