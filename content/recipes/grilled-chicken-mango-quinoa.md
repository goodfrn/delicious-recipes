ingredients:
- "120 g quinoa (about 3/4 cup), thoroughly rinsed and drained"
- "2 medium ripe red tomatoes, each cut into 6 wedges"
- "2 medium yellow tomatoes, each cut into 6 wedges"
- "1 medium ripe mango, peeled, diced"
- "1 small shallot, finely chopped"
- "45 ml fresh chopped cilantro (3 tbsp)"
- "45 ml fresh lime juice (3 tbsp)"
- "30 ml avocado oil (2 tbsp)"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) toasted cumin seeds, coarsely crushed"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) toasted fennel seeds, coarsely crushed"
- "2.5 ml smoked paprika (1/2 tsp)"
- "4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, each halved lengthwise into thin cutlets"
- "Salt and black pepper"
instructions:
- "=== Salad ==="
- "1. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add quinoa, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently for about 10 to 12 minutes. Watch carefully for when grains become translucent with the core barely visible. Drain immediately in a fine sieve and rinse under cold running water to stop cooking. Drain thoroughly and spread on a tray to cool and dry, fluffing occasionally with a fork to separate grains."
- "2. Combine cooled quinoa with red and yellow tomatoes, diced mango, chopped shallot, and cilantro in a large bowl."
- "3. Whisk lime juice and avocado oil until emulsified; season with salt and pepper. Pour dressing over salad and toss lightly but thoroughly to integrate flavors. Set aside at room temperature."
- "=== Chicken ==="
- "4. Preheat grill or barbecue to high heat. Make sure grill grates are clean; brush lightly with oil to prevent sticking."
- "5. In a small dry skillet, toast cumin and fennel seeds for 2 minutes until aromatic and slightly darker, then crush coarsely using a mortar and pestle or spice grinder. Mix with smoked paprika, salt, and black pepper."
- "6. Slice each chicken breast in half horizontally to create thin cutlets. Pat dry with paper towel for better searing and crispness."
- "7. Rub spice mixture all over chicken pieces, pressing firmly to adhere. Let rest for 5 minutes so flavors start to meld."
- "8. Place cutlets on hot grill. Listen to sizzling sound — that’s Maillard reaction setting in. Cook about 3-4 minutes per side. Look for firm texture, opaque color, and clear juices when pierced. Avoid overcooking — chicken should be juicy, not dry."
- "9. Remove from grill and let rest for 3 minutes on warm plate, loosely covered. Resting allows fibers to relax and retain moisture."
- "=== To Serve ==="
- "10. Plate salads with grilled chicken cutlets arranged over or alongside. Drizzle any resting juices over chicken for richness."
- "11. Optional garnish: sprinkle reserved fresh cilantro or chopped fresh mint for contrast and fresh aroma."
- "12. Serve immediately while warm chicken meets cool, bright, textured salad."
introduction: "Think quick grill dinner with fresh produce — bright, punchy, and layered with textures. Not your average quinoa salad. Using toasted cumin and fennel seeds rather than mustard and coriander shifts flavor to warm and slightly licorice-y earthiness. Swap mango varieties depending on what’s ripe — Ataulfo or Tommy Atkins work. Tomatoes: red and yellow for color contrast and subtle sweetness difference. Key technique? Rinse quinoa thoroughly to wash away saponin bitterness, then cool fast to stop overcooking. Chicken sliced thin reduces grilling time and allows spices to penetrate better. Finish with lime and avocado oil dressing — acid cuts richness, oil rounds flavors. No fuss, no pale chicken breasts, clear visual doneness cues guide. Great for when you want grilled meat but crave freshness too. Keep pantry basics replaceable — avocado oil can be olive, fennel seeds swapped for coriander if you prefer. Highlights real kitchen sense with efficiency and flavor clarity."
ingredientsNote: "Quinoa benefits from a thorough rinse and quick cool to keep texture light and separate grains. If cauliflower rice is what you have, pulse steam briefly, but adjust dressing quantities because moisture content differs. Mango: firm ripe fruit makes salad juicy without mush, but canned mango in juice—rinsed well—could substitute in a pinch. Shallot swaps for green onion for a milder bite. Cilantro provides brightness; fresh mint or basil offers nice variation if unwanted. Using avocado oil instead of olive oil reduces pungency, allowing citrus to shine. Toasting cumin and fennel seeds before crushing ensures essential oils release, and compromises initial raw bite of spices. Chicken sliced thin avoids drying out under high heat; if you only have whole breasts, pound gently to even thickness with meat mallet, not too thin to preserve juiciness. Paprika smoked or sweet adds smoky depth; regular can work but flavor profile shifts."
instructionsNote: "Start quinoa with salted water boil and watch grain translucence closely — texture must be toothsome, not mushy. Rinse under cold water to halt carryover cooking and remove residual bitterness. Cooling and fluffing prevents clumping in salad. Combine salad ingredients gently to avoid bruising tomatoes. Dressing emulsifies easier if oil added slowly to lime juice while whisking. Preheat grill hot for immediate sear, creating savory crust that traps juices. Oil grate lightly—prevents sticking, reduces flare-ups. Toast seeds dry in pan until aromatic to unlock volatile flavor compounds; smashed immediately means fresh spice aroma instead of stale powder taste. Spice rub on chicken needs pressure and rest time to infuse flavors rather than scatter on surface. Grill chicken briefly—longer cook results in dryness; thickness guides time, so trust texture and color over time alone. Rest meat briefly to let juices redistribute, preventing leaks on cutting. Serve chicken warm on cool salad for temperature contrast and textural balance. Watch for quick oxidation if salad sits too long; toss before plating for fresh brightness."
tips:
- "Watch quinoa like a hawk. Don't overcook — grains should be slightly translucent; rinse thoroughly to remove bitterness. Fluff carefully to keep texture light."
- "Spices on chicken need time. Press and rub mixture on; let sit 5 minutes for flavor absorption. Grill hot to get that nice crust; 3-4 minutes max per side. Juicy inside, not dry."
- "Oil the grill, but not too much — too slick causes flare-ups. Listen for sizzling when chicken hits pan; that's the Maillard reaction in action. Signals you're on the right track."
- "If you don’t have fresh mango, use canned; rinse well to lower sweetness. Swap avocado oil for olive if needed. Keep flavors fresh and bright while adjusting ingredients."
- "Grilled chicken resting is key; let it sit for 3 minutes after grilling. Redistributes juices. If not rested, meat gets dry — no one wants that. Always cut against the grain."
faq:
- "q: What can I substitute for quinoa? a: Use brown rice or couscous if quinoa isn't available. Both take similar cooking times and taste great."
- "q: How do I know when the chicken is done? a: Check texture, firm and opaque. Juices run clear when pierced. Look for that golden crust, too."
- "q: Can I prepare this salad in advance? a: Yes, but dress just before serving. Otherwise, salad wilts. Keep ingredients separate if making ahead."
- "q: What's the best way to store leftovers? a: Store in an airtight container fridge for up to three days. Keep chicken and salad separate to maintain freshness."
