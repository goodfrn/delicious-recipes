ingredients:
- "1 bulb garlic"
- "500 ml water"
- "100 ml green lentils du Puy, rinsed"
- "25 ml olive oil"
- "25 ml balsamic vinegar"
- "15 ml Dijon mustard"
- "2 small grilled eggplants, diced"
- "250 ml cherry tomatoes, halved"
- "1 jar 170 ml marinated mushrooms, drained and quartered"
- "2 scallions, thinly sliced"
- "1 stalk celery, thinly chopped"
- "25 ml chopped fresh chives"
- "25 ml chopped fresh basil"
- "25 ml chopped fresh celery leaves"
- "Salt and pepper"
instructions:
- "Cut top off garlic bulb. In pot, boil water, lentils, garlic bulb whole. Cover, simmer on low around 50 minutes or until lentils soft. Salt and pepper at end. Drain if needed. Squeeze softened garlic out, mash."
- "Whisk oil, mustard, vinegar in bowl. Add lentils, garlic purée. Add eggplant, tomatoes, mushrooms, scallions, celery, chives, basil, celery leaves. Stir. Taste, adjust seasoning."
- "Serve room temp or chilled. Goes well beside spicy pork tenderloin."
introduction: "Lentils simmer with garlic. The garlic softens, turns sweet, then mashed into the mix. No roasted yellow peppers here. Instead, smoky grilled eggplant dices bring depth. Mushrooms give earthiness replacing artichokes. Cherry tomatoes sliced. Onions and celery diced fine. Chives, basil, celery leaves chopped fresh, burst of herbs throughout. The dressing tangy from balsamic and sharp mustard, mellowed with olive oil. Lentils soak it all in. Mix it then chill or serve at room temp, hearty and vegetal. Vegan, gluten free, no nuts or dairy. Good for mains, sides, or light meals. A rustic French touch."
ingredientsNote: "Lentils du Puy preferred for firmness and flavor, rinsed before cooking. Whole garlic bulb roasted in pot with lentils, then mashed, not discarded; imparts mellow garlic taste but not sharp. Grilled eggplant swaps yellow peppers—adds smokiness and heartiness. Mushrooms marinated in oil replace artichokes, keeping oil element but altering flavor profile to earthier. Fresh herbs essential—chives, basil, celery leaves—brighten and lift the dish. Oil, vinegar, mustard form simple vinaigrette dressing, balance acidity and fat. Season at end for control of saltiness."
instructionsNote: "Cut garlic bulb top off to expose cloves. Simmer lentils and whole garlic in water until lentils tender but not mushy, around 50 minutes. Drain excess liquid if needed. Press cloves from garlic bulb, mash into creamy purée. Whisk dressing ingredients: oil, vinegar, mustard. Combine lentils, garlic purée, and diced vegetables. Add herbs last, toss well. Adjust with salt and pepper after tasting. Chill to blend flavors or serve right away. Keeps well refrigerated. Serves four comfortably. Great alongside spicy pork or as a vegetarian meal alone."
tips:
- "Use fresh greens make a difference. Chives, basil, celery leaves chopped finely. This adds a fresh layer of flavor. Don't skip. You want that burst. A good amount necessary."
- "Control that salt. Season at the end. You want taste balance. Depending on garlic strength, adjust. Remember, lentils soak flavors. Salting prior alters outcome. Be careful."
- "Cook lentils properly for soft texture. Too much heat makes mush. Too little? Hard bits spoil bite. Watch closely. Aiming for tender, but not breaking apart. Simmer helps achieve this."
- "Chill before serving. Flavors blend well together. Ensure they intermingle nicely. About 30 minutes chill time is best. Cold enhances taste. Room temperature works too, but cool has edge."
- "Perfect for meal prep. Store in fridge. Keeps well for several days. A hearty option for lunch or dinner. Grab it quickly. Great side dish for grilled meats. Versatile too."

- "q: Can I add more veggies? a: Yes, definitely. Zucchini, bell peppers, whatever you like. Just adjust cook times to keep everything tender. Play with flavors; it's versatile."
- "q: What's a good side dish pairing? a: Try it beside grilled meats. Spicy pork tenderloin or chicken works well. Light flavors let salad shine. Perfect balance; complements nicely."
- "q: What if herbs aren't available? a: Dried herbs can work too. But fresh is key for flavor. Maybe use Italian seasoning for a twist. Adjust amounts to taste."
