ingredients:
- "275 g pennes or other short pasta"
- "5 Italian sausages mild or spicy"
- "450 ml yellow cherry tomatoes"
- "450 ml red cherry tomatoes"
- "2 cloves garlic, minced"
- "65 ml olive oil"
- "3 ml black pepper, cracked"
- "3 ml crushed red chili flakes (adjust to taste)"
- "3 green zucchinis, diced"
- "8 green onions, thinly sliced"
- "100 ml grated Pecorino Romano cheese"
- "1 ball fresh buffalo mozzarella about 300 g or 5 bocconcini, torn"
instructions:
- "Fill a pot with salted water. Boil pasta until al dente, drain but keep a bit of water. Toss with a spoonful of olive oil. Set aside."
- "Remove sausage meat from casings, shape into roughly 1 teaspoon sized balls."
- "Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add sausage meatballs, yellow and red cherry tomatoes, and garlic. Cook for about 3 minutes until the sausage starts browning and tomatoes begin to soften."
- "Sprinkle in black pepper and chili flakes. Reduce heat slightly. Stir occasionally for 7 to 10 minutes until tomatoes burst and sauce thickens."
- "Add diced zucchini and sliced green onions. Stir and cook for about 6 minutes until zucchini softens and sausage cooks through properly. Season with salt."
- "Combine sausage and vegetable mix with pasta. Toss thoroughly, adding reserved pasta water a little at a time to loosen the sauce if dry."
- "Divide between 4 plates. Generously grate Pecorino Romano on top and garnish with torn mozzarella pieces. Serve warm."
introduction: "Pasta. Sausage. Tomatoes. That’s the starting point. Slight changes make a noticeable difference. More zucchini this time, a twist on the cheese with Pecorino Romano instead of Parmigiano. Buffalo mozzarella swapping for classic mozzarella for a bit more tang and cream. Little meatballs of sausage cook quickly, juicy with a hint of spice. Two kinds of cherry tomatoes give interest - yellow and red. Garlic present but not overpowering. Olive oil fuels everything. Green onions add crunch and freshness late in cooking. Heat is variable with the chili flakes. Quick preparation, decent cooking time. Leftover pasta water helps bind sauce. No fuss, flavor layers build in the pan."
ingredientsNote: "Penne is ideal here for its shape and ability to hold the chunky sauce. Slightly less pasta than the original version emphasizes the sauce over the carbs. Five sausages give more meat density but smaller balls so they cook evenly. Yellow and red cherry tomatoes keep sweetness balanced. Three zucchinis replace two but keep dice size similar for even cooking. Olive oil slightly increased for better cooking surface and moist veggies. Black pepper and chili flakes nudged up a bit for stronger spice note. Pecorino Romano chosen over Parmigiano for sharper, saltier punch. Buffalo mozzarella adds subtle creaminess and richness. Garlic remains a foundational aromatic but limited to two cloves minsed fine. Green onions more abundant for crunch and fresh bite contrast with soft zucchini."
instructionsNote: "Cooking pasta al dente first is vital; drain but don’t rinse to keep starches for sauce adhesion. Olive oil toss post-drain prevents clump. Sausage removed from casing before browning so it crisps differently in smaller balls rather than one big link. High heat start to sear meat and burst tomatoes fast, then lowered for slow tomato breakdown without burning. Timing tomato burst and sauce thickening is flexible; watch closely after 7 minutes. Adding zucchini and green onions later prevents overcooking and mushiness. Frequent stirring avoids burning on the pan base. Salt adjusted only near end keeps layers of flavor balanced. Combining pasta and sausage-tomato-veg mixture off heat prevents overcooking pasta. Leftover pasta water integration is key for sauciness without adding extra oil or cream. Cheese toppings last, melting softly from residual heat. Recommendations: setup mise en place for cheese and garnish ahead, slice green onions thin, and watch sausage balls closely to avoid drying out."
tips:
- "Use salted boiling water for pasta. This enhances flavor. Don't rinse after draining. This keeps starch. It helps sauce cling. Toss with olive oil after draining. Prevents stickiness. Timing on pasta is vital. Al dente texture is best."
- "Sausage meat must come out of the casings. Shape into small balls. They cook faster than links. Crisp edges are desirable. Browning at a high heat brings flavors. Pay attention to the browning process. Avoid burning."
- "Add zucchini and green onions later in the cooking. This keeps them fresh and offers crunch. Overcooking vegetables makes them mushy. Stir occasionally throughout cooking. Monitor closely when tomatoes burst. Sauce thickening takes time."
- "Combine pasta and sauce off heat. This prevents overcooking your pasta. Use reserved pasta water to adjust sauce consistency. Adds moisture without excess oil. Balance flavors with correct seasoning. Adjust salt near the end."
- "Cheese toppings go on before serving. Grate fresh Pecorino Romano generously. Add torn mozzarella pieces. Residual heat will melt it slightly. Serve immediately for the best experience. This dish is best enjoyed warm."
faq:
- "q: What’s the best way to cook the sausage? a: Remove from casings. Shape into small balls. Cook over medium heat until browned. Avoid big links."
- "q: Can I use different vegetables? a: Yes, experiment with bell peppers or mushrooms. Keep cooking times in mind. Adjust to your preference."
- "q: How do I reheat leftovers? a: Use the stovetop for best results. Add a splash of water. Heat gently to avoid dryness. Microwave works but may dry out."
- "q: How long does this dish last in the fridge? a: Typically lasts 3 to 4 days. Let it cool first. Store in airtight containers for freshness."
