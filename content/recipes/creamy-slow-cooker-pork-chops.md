description: "Pork chops dry seasoned and seared in hot oil for crust. Onions sliced thick, layered bottom slow cooker. Chicken broth and dry white wine add moisture. Slow cook low 1.5 hours til chops hit 145 degrees. Broth blended till silky, then mushrooms sautéed with garlic in same pan. Heavy cream and cornstarch slurry thickens sauce, rosemary and parmesan folded in. Salt and cracked pepper finish. Nutrient swap: chicken broth swapped for vegetable broth; parmesan replaced by pecorino. Garlic swapped for shallots for deeper aroma. Ends creamy, rich, wines acidity cuts through. Eyes on sear, texture, final sauce thickness. Time nudged for sensory cues. Serve folds well over chops."
metaDescription: "Creamy Slow Cooker Pork Chops combine seared chops with rich sauce. Tender pork over onions, infused with wine for depth. A must-try dish."
ogDescription: "Slow Cooker Pork Chops covered in creamy sauce. Perfect for cozy dinners. Opt for vegetable broth for a lighter touch or try with mushrooms."

ingredients:
- "4 bone-in pork chops about 1 inch thick"
- "1 ½ tsp kosher salt, divided"
- "1 tsp freshly ground black pepper, divided"
- "2 Tbsp vegetable oil (or avocado oil as substitute)"
- "2 medium yellow onions, sliced thick"
- "1 cup vegetable broth (sub for chicken broth)"
- "3/4 cup dry white wine (Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio)"
- "3 Tbsp unsalted butter"
- "8 oz cremini mushrooms, sliced"
- "2 small shallots, minced (swap garlic for depth)"
- "1 Tbsp cornstarch"
- "3 Tbsp cold water"
- "3/4 cup heavy cream"
- "1 tsp fresh rosemary leaves, finely chopped"
- "1/3 cup grated pecorino romano (instead of parmesan)"
instructions:
- "Pat pork chops dry front and back. Season evenly with 1 tsp salt and ½ tsp pepper each side. Dry surface key for crust; don’t skip."
- "Preheat a medium heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat. Coat bottom with oil. Wait until oil ripples and just starts to shimmer; test with a tiny drop of water—should pop."
- "Add chops one by one, sear undisturbed for 90-120 seconds each side until deeply browned crust forms. Searing seals juices; no crowding in pan or chops steam."
- "Remove chops from pan; turn off heat but keep pan nearby for gravy. Don’t rinse or wipe now; fond is flavor base."
- "Layer onions thickly in slow cooker base, use all. Onions act like a trivet, absorb pork drippings, soften slowly."
- "Nestle chops on onions. Pour in broth and wine gently, enough to barely cover onions but don’t drown chops."
- "Cover, cook on low 1 hour 20 min; internal temp target 145F. Check with instant-read thermometer. Carryover heat finishes meat; no guesswork here."
- "Remove chops carefully; tent loose foil to rest. Avoid piercing meat while hot."
- "Use immersion blender right in crock to blend broth and softened onions until velvety. If no immersion blender, ladle into blender in batches carefully."
- "Place skillet back on medium-high, add butter. Melt til bubbly but not brown."
- "Add mushrooms, sauté 5-6 min til edges crisp and water evaporates. Mushrooms should sizzle and shrink, get golden. Then add shallots, stir 1-2 min until fragrant but not burnt."
- "Pour blended onion broth into pan. Stir and scrape browned bits from bottom with wooden spoon to deglaze, releasing deep flavor."
- "Mix cornstarch and cold water to slurry, whisk into pan along with cream. Simmer gently, sauce thickens and coats spoon—thick but pourable."
- "Toss in rosemary, pecorino romano, remaining ½ tsp salt and ½ tsp pepper. Taste, adjust seasoning incrementally; cheese salty, add salt cautiously."
- "Serve sauce immediately spooned over pork chops. Sauce thickens more as cools; reheat gently if needed."
- "Backup: If no slow cooker, use covered ovenproof dish at 300F for 1 hour checking temp."
- "Mushroom sub: porcini mushrooms for earthy punch or button if unavailable."
- "Wine sub: dry vermouth or extra broth ok but wine acidity brightens."
- "Tip: Always rest chops before slicing to keep juicy. Use thermometer not time alone—trust feel and temp."
introduction: "Started with sear; build flavors from crust. Moist chops need dry surface and hot pan—No shortcuts. Onions soft, sweet, mushy layer under pork, slow cooked. Braising liquid split with wine for acid kick; vegetable broth swaps lighter if chicken broth not handy. Blend to thicken base, then mushroom sauté brings earthiness and texture contrast. Garlic swaps for shallots bring subtle sweetness, depth when cooked slowly. Cornstarch slurry crucial for legible sauce texture, not glue. Parmesan subs with pecorino to add sharp saltier note. Rosemary high aroma, chopped fresh releases oils fast. Salt last to control output but season carefully as cheese adds. Method tested and tweak based on sensory cues."
ingredientsNote: "Dry pork chops well; wet chops steam skip sear. Use thick sliced onions for consistent base, yellow onions optimal but white or sweet ok. Vegetable broth keeps it lighter; chicken broth richer but salt accordingly. Dry white wine essential acidity, pick midrange quality; avoid sweet wines or risk flavor clash. Butter for cooking mushrooms adds richness, oil doesn’t brown mushrooms well alone. Cornstarch slurry thicker than flour—flour makes “cloudy” sauce. Heavy cream not milk; cream ensures velvety richness. Fresh rosemary highest flavor, dried can be harsh. Pecorino instead parmesan adds sharp salty tang but salt to taste. Garlic and shallot textures close but shallots cook quieter and sweeter, great alternative."
instructionsNote: "Keep pan HOT before searing; test with water droplets. Don’t move chops early; crust forms best with patience. Slow cooker layering creates gentle cooking environment; onions trap moisture and flavor. Wine and broth liquid monitor level; avoid dry burn or watery stew, just enough to cover onions. Use thermometer at thickest part for doneness. Blending broth and onions creates thick texture without lumps—blend carefully with immersion blender in pot avoids transfers and mess. Sauté mushrooms till strongly browned and moisture evaporates; raw mushrooms release water and dilute sauce flavor. Deglaze de-fond impact; don’t skip scraping bits off pan, unlocks umami. Incorporate cornstarch slurry slowly, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Sauce thickens visibly—coats spoon ribbon signals done. Add cheese off heat momentarily if worried about curdling. Adjust seasoning last, taste is king. Serve hot, sauce thickens on standing, reheat gently over low flame."
tips:
- "Sear chops till they sing. Listen for that sizzle. Dry surface essential for browning. Pat and season well. No wet meat allowed. It'll steam."
- "Onions are more than just flavor. Layer thick, they soak up juiciness. Loose layered; not all squished together. Creates moisture layer."
- "Wine brings needed acidity. But don't drown in liquid. Cover onions, not chops. Just enough—monitor slowly during cooking."
- "Immersion blender hassle-free. Avoid splatter while blending. If no tool, ladle carefully. Let steam escape, avoid burns. Safety first!"
- "Cornstarch magic thickens without clouding sauce. Mix properly with cold water. Add slowly, stirring all the while. Watch for texture."
faq:
- "q: Can I use chicken instead of pork? a: Yes, but cook times differ. Check doneness; avoid drying out. Chicken breasts cook faster than pork."
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Store in airtight container. Refrigerate up to three days. Reheat gently or sauce thickens. Add a splash of cream."
- "q: What if I don't have white wine? a: Use dry vermouth; good substitute. Can use more broth but that acidity's key for balance."
- "q: Common mistake with slow cooker? a: Overfilling leads to uneven cooking. Monitor liquid levels. No one wants burnt edges or soupy onions."
