ingredients:
- "900 ml peeled, seeded butternut squash cut into 1.5 cm cubes"
- "25 ml olive oil"
- "350 g rigatoni"
- "600 ml sliced leeks (typically 1 large or 2 small)"
- "1 medium yellow onion finely chopped"
- "3 garlic cloves minced"
- "50 ml unsalted butter"
- "50 ml all-purpose flour"
- "450 ml chicken stock"
- "275 ml whole milk"
- "1.6 liters baby spinach roughly chopped (about 5 cups packed)"
- "1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes optional"
- "1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg optional"
- "200 ml sharp cheddar shredded"
- "160 ml Parmigiano-Reggiano grated"
- "Salt and black pepper freshly ground"
instructions:
- "Set oven rack center. Preheat oven to 205 Celsius or 400 Fahrenheit. Line baking sheet parchment. Toss squash cubes with olive oil, salt, pepper. Roast 18-22 minutes stirring halfway; tender with golden edges signals done. Remove."
- "Boil salted water for pasta. Cook rigatoni al dente, around 9-11 minutes; pasta should resist bite with slight chew not mush. Drain, toss with small drizzle olive oil to prevent sticking. Hold aside."
- "Use same pan for flavor continuity. Melt butter over medium heat. Add leeks, onion, garlic; sweat gently until softened and translucent, about 8-10 minutes, no color. Season lightly with salt and pepper to coax sweetness. Sprinkle flour evenly; cook stirring one full minute—forms base roux. Gradually whisk in chicken stock and milk, warm liquid prevents lumps. Bring to low boil, reduce slightly for 6 minutes to thicken sauce to creamy yet pourable. Too thick means add splash milk; too thin, simmer few more."
- "Off heat, immerse immersion blender into the leek sauce until silky smooth. Careful not to aerate excessively. Fold in roasted squash, cooked rigatoni, and chopped spinach. The residual heat wilts spinach perfectly. Taste for seasoning; add pinch crushed red pepper flakes and nutmeg if using, plus salt and pepper to balance savory depth."
- "Transfer mixture into a greased 33 x 23 cm baking dish; spread evenly. Top with cheddar and Parmigiano evenly scattered. Bake 23-27 minutes until bubbling and surface turns light golden. Avoid burning cheese by tenting loosely with foil if edges brown early."
- "Remove from oven. Rest undisturbed 12-15 minutes; gravity settles layers, making serving cleaner and slices hold shape better."
introduction: "Roasting squash? Listen for tender snapping under fork not mushy pulp; caramelization makes flavor deepen. Leeks take time to coax sweetness—rush and they’ll turn bitter or crunchy. The key: low heat, patient softening in butter. Sauce needs thickness but must stay pourable; if it clumps or pools watery, adjust liquid first before baking. Combining textures is everything here: al dente pasta still with bite, spinach that’s vibrant not limp. Cheese topping bakes golden, aromas nutty-cheddar mingle with roasted veggies. Timing flexible within minutes but trust eye and touch over clock. Perfect for potlucks, weeknights, or layered lunches that reheat well. Swap chicken broth for mushroom stock for earthy depth. Use kale if spinach missing. Cotija or mozzarella stand in for cheese; just balance salt accordingly. Keep your mise en place organized so squash roasting overlaps pasta cooking, saves time."
ingredientsNote: "Reduced squash quantity favors better sauce to pasta ratio; too much squash and gratin turns gummy. Butter and flour combined create classic béchamel base but flour can be replaced with cornstarch slurry for gluten-free version; use half the volume cornstarch. Chicken stock adds umami; vegetable stock acceptable for vegetarian. Milk type influences creaminess; whole preferred but 2% works with less richness. Cheddar choice affects final bite—use extra sharp if boldness preferred, mellow mild cheddar softens taste. Parmigiano-Reggiano grated fresh provides nuttiness and salt; powder won’t impart same texture. Spinach should be fresh or well-drained frozen; watery greens make it soggy. Garlic dosage can be varied but avoid overpowering—balance with sweetness from squash and leeks."
instructionsNote: "Roasting squash on parchment helps even cooking and easy sheet pan cleanup but confirm tender by stabbing—the flesh should yield with little resistance yet hold shape. When draining pasta, reserve some cooking water as emergency adjuster if sauce thickens excessively during mixing. Sweating onions and leeks requires patience and low to medium heat—avoid browning which introduces harsh bitter notes. Roux step critical for thickened creamy sauce; stir constantly to prevent flour lumps and burnt taste. Immersion blender ensures consistent texture; if lacking, transfer in batches to standing blender or mash finely for chunkier mouthfeel. Cheese scattering evenly promotes uniform melting and browning. Baking uncovered towards end allows crispy top. Resting before serving finalizes internal moisture redistribution; do not skip to avoid sloppy portions."
tips:
- "Roast squash until tender; golden edges signal readiness. Watch closely. Too long and it turns mushy. Check with fork—snaps tender without collapsing."
- "Squash too much? Ratio off. Stick with 900 ml; don't overdo. Sauce must coat pasta well. Gummy gratin isn’t appealing. Add more pasta if needed."
- "Leeks need patience and low heat. Avoid browning; ends up bitter. Should be sweet and translucent. Use slow sweats in butter for best flavor."
- "Sauce thick? Add splash milk to adjust. Too thin? Simmer longer. Should be creamy yet pourable. Roux is key; stir constantly to prevent lumps."
- "Rest gratin after baking. 12-15 minutes undisturbed. It helps layers settle. Cleaner servings. Don't skip this step; sloppy portions happen otherwise."
faq:
- "q: Pasta undercooked? a: Cook until al dente. Last few minutes matter. Drain and toss with oil. Hold until sauce ready. Don’t overboil."
- "q: Can I replace cheese? a: Yes, use mozzarella or cotija. Adjust salt based on options. Balance varies. Try other cheeses if preferred."
- "q: Leftover storage tips? a: Store in airtight container. Refrigerate up to 3 days. Reheat in oven for best texture. Microwaving softens crust."
- "q: Sauce clumpy? a: Blend sauce longer with immersion blender. If too thick? Thin with reserved pasta water. Add small amounts until right."
