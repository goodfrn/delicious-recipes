slug: "pork-filet-caramelized-pears"
description: "Pork tenderloin seared in a caramel base then simmered with pear and aromatics. Combines sugar, lime, and savory elements like fish sauce and soy. Pears add fruit sweetness, caramel layers, and acidity. Cook low and slow to keep pork juicy and blush pink inside. Sauce reduces to glossy, syrupy finish coating tender slices. Easy swap pears for firm apple or quince. Sambal oelek offers heat but can skip or replace with chili flakes. Technique focuses on watching caramel color and meat temp rather than times."

ingredients:
- "90 ml sugar (reduced from 125 ml)"
- "50 ml water (for caramel stage)"
- "1 pork tenderloin (about 400 g)"
- "1 firm apple peeled and sliced thin (substitute for pear)"
- "1 small shallot minced (substituted for onion)"
- "1 clove garlic minced"
- "20 ml lime juice"
- "20 ml tamari (gluten-free soy alternative)"
- "5 ml fish sauce (nuoc-mam)"
- "1 ml chili flakes (substitute for sambal oelek)"
- "Salt and pepper"
- "Additional 20 ml water reserved for simmer"
instructions:
- "Heat sugar and 50 ml water in heavy skillet over medium heat. Avoid stirring once syrup starts bubbling. Watch closely; amber hues signal readiness. Caramel smell should be rich but not burnt. If smoking, lower heat immediately."
- "Quickly add pork tenderloin to caramel. Sear, turning to coat all sides. The meat should brown fast without burning sugar. Splash water cautiously if caramel thickens too fast or darkens beyond amber. Season with salt and pepper. Remove pork and keep warm under foil."
- "Use the pork juices and residual caramel in pan to add minced shallot, garlic, and apple slices. Toss swiftly. The fruit should sizzle and start browning in 2-3 minutes, releasing sweetness and aroma. Avoid stirring too much to keep caramel texture intact."
- "Return pork to pan with remaining 20 ml water, lime juice, tamari, fish sauce, and chili flakes. Stir once to combine but don’t disrupt caramel crust. Bring to a gentle simmer then cover. Lower heat and poach gently about 18-20 minutes or until internal temp reaches about 53°C (127°F) for light blush inside. Resist overshoot for dry meat."
- "Remove pork, rest 10 minutes covered loosely. Meanwhile, keep sauce reducing over medium heat until thick and syrupy. Taste and adjust seasoning — acid might need balance with a pinch of sugar or more salt."
- "Slice pork thin against the grain. Spoon pear sauce generously over. Serve with steamed rice and lightly steamed greens like bok choy or rapini for contrast and crunch."
introduction: "Forget fuss, caramel needs attention not stirring. Watch sugar transition, amber is gold but seconds away from bitter. Quick flip pork in syrup coats flavors like glaze, locks moisture. Apples work here instead of pears; same texture but less watery, more tart. Shallots bring subtler sweetness than onions and balance garlic pungency. Lime juice cuts richness, tangy splash lifts flavors before slow simmer. That simmer phase critical — gentle bubbles, low heat keeps pork tender pink. Sauce reduction time not exact. Watch pour consistency, coat spoon thickly but still glossy. No dry meat, do rest pounds of muscle fibers tighten. Slice thin. Serve simple veggies steamed, rice to soak saucy layers. Skip sambal if you lack heat tolerance, chili flakes same punch, predictable. This one, requires senses over clocks. No cheat here."
ingredientsNote: "Sugar quantity lowered to prevent harsh caramel bitterness. Using apple for firm bite and acidity; if pears on hand are very soft, they risk turning mushy. Shallots replace onions to add subtle sweetness without overpowering. Tamari used in place of regular soy for gluten-free option and milder salty flavor. Fish sauce kept low to add umami but not overpower caramel's sweetness. Chili flakes substitute for sambal oelek—less texture but similar heat. Adjust water quantities carefully when caramelizing—too much water cools sugar and prevents caramelization, too little means burning. Fresh lime juice essential for acidity, canned often dull. Garlic and shallots minced fine to caramelize quickly without burning or turning bitter. Reserve some water to adjust sauce thickness in second simmer stage."
instructionsNote: "Caramel sugar critical: wait until amber, no stirring but gentle swirling if needed. Adding meat quickly afterward to stop caramel cooking progression avoids bitter notes. Searing pork in caramel locks juices and starts rich color. Use thermometer; undercooked pork raw, over means dry fibers. Apple and aromatics added carefully—too much stirring scrapes caramel layers off pan. Simmer covered short time to finish cooking, piercing meat releases juices otherwise lost. Resting is non-negotiable for moisture redistribution. Sauce reduced uncovered, watch texture closely — too thick means sugar crystallizing, too thin means watery flavor. Adjust at end with seasoning; acidity or salt for balance. Serve sliced thin against grain fibers; thick cuts get chewy. Quick cold water splash can stop caramel burn but avoid overdoing or caramel will seize. This technique repeats in many dishes—watch sugar colors, rely on smell and texture cues to nail."
tips:
- "Watch caramel color closely. Avoid stirring. Amber is ideal—too dark means burnt. A splash of water cools it but can change texture. Monitor temps not times."
- "For apples, use firmer varieties to avoid mushiness. Peel, slice thin. Cut against grain when serving. Juicy bites—don’t sacrifice texture."
- "Rest the pork, let juices redistribute. Don’t skip this step. Trim fat before cooking, it renders but can make dish greasy. Balance richness."
- "Adjust lime juice to taste; acid cuts sweetness. Monitor sauce texture as it reduces. Thick but glossy, needs to coat spoon. No one wants a watery sauce."
- "Chili flakes add subtle heat; adjust to preference. No sambal? No problem. Just a pinch goes a long way. Options are key in flavor building."
faq:
- "q: How to know if pork is cooked? a: Use thermometer. 53°C is target. Too low means raw. Too high, fibers dry out. Check temp."
- "q: What if sauce is too thick? a: Just add water slowly. Stir but gently. Keep cooking; shiny, glazed finish is goal. Stand over the pot."
- "q: Can I store leftovers? a: Refrigerate up to three days max. Reheat gently. Avoid high heat or microwave; risk drying out pork."
- "q: What's a good side with this dish? a: Steamed greens work great. Bok choy or other crunchy veggies contrast sauce well. Quick prep is ideal."
