ingredients:
- "1 small onion, thinly sliced"
- "1 mild green pepper (e.g. cubanelle or Anaheim), diced"
- "20 ml clarified butter (about 1 1/3 tablespoons)"
- "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil"
- "2 medium peeled tomatoes, roughly chopped"
- "1 tablespoon Aleppo chili flakes, divided"
- "1/2 teaspoon smoked sweet paprika"
- "Salt to taste"
- "Freshly ground black pepper, 1/4 teaspoon"
- "2 large eggs"
- "50 grams crumbly feta cheese or Turkish beyaz peynir"
- "Aleppo chili flakes for garnish"
instructions:
- "Heat clarified butter with olive oil in a small frying pan over medium flame. Once the butter melts and starts shimmering, add sliced onions and diced green pepper."
- "Sauté, tossing occasionally, until onions turn translucent and edges show light browning, about 6–7 minutes. Listen for faint sizzling sounds; aroma should shift from raw sharpness to sweet earthiness."
- "Add chopped tomatoes, 2/3 tablespoon Aleppo chili, smoked paprika, salt, and black pepper. Stir to combine thoroughly."
- "Reduce heat slightly and simmer uncovered, stirring gently now and then. Watch sauce thicken—edges will look glossy and cling to the spoon when lifted, roughly 7–9 minutes."
- "Make two shallow hollows in the chunky sauce, then carefully crack eggs into each. Lower heat to minimal and cover pan with a tight lid or inverted plate to keep steam in."
- "Cook gently until whites set and yolks are still slightly runny but not liquid; about 5 minutes. Peek occasionally to avoid overcooking, look for opaque whites and soft, domed yolks."
- "Remove from heat, scatter crumbled feta or beyaz peynir atop while ragout is hot. Sprinkle remaining Aleppo chili flakes for a touch of heat and visual pop."
- "Serve immediately with rustic bread or toasted flatbread to scoop up soft eggs and sauce."
introduction: "Mornings no time for fuss. Grab a pan, butter melting, onions and peppers sizzling, scent thickening the air. That sweet sharpness softens, melts into deep golden strands. Tomatoes dumped in, bubbling, thickening, colors deepening to rich orange-red, flecked with Aleppo heat and smoky paprika’s whisper. Eggs cracked in pockets of the latest flavor, steam trapped tight to coax the whites firm but yolks pliant. Cheese crumbled on top before it cools, a salty bite cuts through the cream. Serve fast with bread, dive right in. No excuses. Just flavor layered in every forkful. Turkish soul food meets simple weekday reality."
ingredientsNote: "Small onion and mild pepper provide the base sweetness and subtle crunch — not overpowering heat. Mild peppers like cubanelle or Anaheim work as easier substitutions for Turkish green peppers. Clarified butter keeps the fat clean and high-heat stable; olive oil adds a fruity balance. Tomatoes should be peeled for smooth texture, can swap fresh for canned crushed in a pinch but adjust cook time. Aleppo chili brings moderate heat and fruity warmth — replace with smoked paprika plus a pinch of cayenne if unavailable. Feta or beyaz peynir adds characteristic salty creaminess; good quality feta or a firm goat cheese can stand in. Adjust salt carefully due to cheese saltiness. Fresh cracked pepper rounds it off. If eggs cook too fast on top, lower heat further then rely on steam for gentle poaching."
instructionsNote: "Clarified butter must be hot enough to create sizzle on onions but not so hot it chars and turns bitter. Stir often first few minutes to avoid sticking then less as onions soften. Watch onions and peppers closely; golden edges and softened texture signal readiness, raw bite ruins the base. Adding tomatoes introduces liquid; simmer uncovered to concentrate and thicken. Sauce should be visibly thicker before eggs, no watery puddles. Crack eggs one at a time to avoid shells, break yolks only if making scrambled version. Covering traps steam essential for even cooking. Watch eggs carefully after lid: whites turn opaque, yolks slightly domed but jiggle when pan nudged. Overcooked eggs get rubbery whites, chalky yolks. Finish with cheese while hot to allow slight melting without weeping. Garnish with chili flakes last; too early loses crispness and sharp heat."
tips:
- "Use good quality clarified butter and olive oil. Bring butter to just shimmering. It makes a difference, trust in the sizzle. Mild peppers work, but even bell peppers are fine if you can't find cubanelle or Anaheim."
- "Watch the onions closely. They should soften and sweeten without burning. Smell it; the earthiness should replace the sharp bite. Adjust flames as needed. Layer flavors early."
- "Tomatoes must be chopped but could be canned in a pinch. If using fresh tomatoes, peel them for texture and taste. Unpeeled tomatoes will change everything; avoid. Simmer until thick."
- "Eggs need space to poach gently. Make hollows. Crack carefully to avoid shells. Don't rush this step. Cover tight, steam is your friend here. Don’t overcook; whites should firm but yolks soft."
- "Use a good feta or beyaz peynir. Cheeses can vary, but aim for something salty. It brings a creamy texture that contrasts with the ragout. Adjust salt according to the cheese."
faq:
- "q: Can I use different herbs? a: Absolutely, parsley or dill can work well. Fresh is better, but dry in a pinch. Don’t overpower the main flavors. Keep it simple."
- "q: What if my eggs are overcooked? a: If yolks harden, try again with lower heat next time. Adjust the cover, steam can't cook too fast. Crack one for dynamic eggs."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cover them in fridges. Use for a quick meal next day. Warm gently. Microwaving can dry out eggs. Aim for fast heat, watch it closely."
- "q: No Aleppo chili, what now? a: Swap with smoked paprika and a dash of cayenne for heat. It won’t be the same, but it retains some depth; adjust to taste."
