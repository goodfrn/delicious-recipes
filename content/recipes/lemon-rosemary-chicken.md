ingredients:
- "1.6 kg bone-in skinless chicken pieces (thighs, drumsticks, breasts)"
- "juice of 2 lemons"
- "75 ml all-purpose flour"
- "40 ml extra virgin olive oil"
- "1 medium shallot, minced finely"
- "200 ml dry white wine"
- "450 ml chicken stock"
- "3 fresh rosemary sprigs"
- "3 teaspoons dried thyme"
- "2 lemons scrubbed, quartered thinly"
- "fresh rosemary leaves for garnish"
- "salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Marinate chicken in lemon juice and a pinch of salt in fridge 25 minutes; moisture will bead and smell bright. Drain well to avoid steaming when browning."
- "Toss chicken pieces evenly with flour seasoned with salt; coating must be light to allow browning, not paste-like."
- "Heat half olive oil in heavy pot over medium-high heat until shimmering. Brown half chicken until golden, skin slightly crisp, about 3 min per side. Do in batches to avoid crowding—important."
- "Set browned chicken aside. Add remaining oil, then shallot, stir till translucent and aromas release, 2-3 min. Avoid browning shallot to keep sauce clean."
- "Pour wine in to deglaze, scraping bottom to lift browned bits; this builds deep flavor base. Boil briefly till slightly reduced, acid tames."
- "Nestle chicken pieces back, pour chicken stock. Toss in rosemary sprigs and dried thyme. Bring to simmer, cover, lower heat to gentle bubble. Cook 32-35 min or until meat yields easily from bone when poked with fork."
- "Add lemon slices, push down into liquid, cook uncovered another 18 min. Watch sauce thickness; should coat back of spoon, not watery or sticky."
- "Remove chicken, lemon slices, rosemary stalks promptly; leaving flesh to rest keeps juices locked."
- "Increase heat to medium-high, reduce sauce if needed to half or until syrupy but pourable. Taste, then season with salt and pepper carefully—flavors concentrate during reduction."
- "Serve chicken topped with lemon slices and spoonful of sauce. Sprinkle fresh rosemary leaves for herbal crispness."
- "Pair with fluffy basmati rice and steamed green beans or sautéed baby carrots for contrast and balance."
introduction: "Bright sharp citrus bathes lightly floured chicken pieces trimmed off skin for lean protein clarity. The floral pine scent of rosemary melds with subtle earthy thyme beneath bubbles of reduced white wine and chicken stock. Precise browning techniques seal edges while ensuring surface crispness—the thin crust holds moisture. Simmer low and slow to coax tender separation from bone without falling apart. Lemon slices brighten the rich herbaceous broth. Adjust dried herbs upward if fresh unavailable. Watch closely as sauce shrinks—too thick becomes gluey, too sparse lacks punch. Rustic but elegant French-inspired dish that’s adaptable, forgiving with timing and herbs."
ingredientsNote: "Chicken pieces with bone deliver flavor and slow-release moisture; skin removed for less fat presence but retain juiciness with proper marinate and sear. Lemon juice substitutes with lime if you prefer sharper notes. Flour amount slightly increased to ensure coating sticks and creates better fond for browning—don’t skip seasoning flour. Using shallots instead of onions trims sweetness and enhances acidity balance. White wine can be replaced with dry vermouth or even extra stock if no alcohol—adjust flavor accordingly. Fresh rosemary sprigs are indispensable; dry thyme replaces dry rosemary to vary aromatic profile with familiar pine-citrus hints. Use at least two fresh rosemary stalks; they impart depth, leaves garnish afterward for freshness. Lemon slices thin and even to avoid bitterness yet provide visible vibrant garnish."
instructionsNote: "Start with marinating chicken for around 25 minutes to lightly infuse acid and loosen muscle fibers—essential for tenderness. Draining before dredging ensures flour adheres properly without clumping, preventing soggy crust. Browning in two batches key to avoid steam and promote Maillard browning which locks flavor. Keep oil temperature medium-high; sizzling but not smoking. Shallots sweat not brown; sharp deglaze with wine retrieves all fond—thin layer brown bits stuck to pot bottom that deliver robust flavor once dissolved. Low simmer after lid covers avoids protein toughening seen at rolling boil. Adding citrus late in cooking avoids pith bitterness but allows fragrance to saturate. Removing solids before final reduction ensures sauce clarity. Watch sauce texture visually and by spoon test—too thick indicates overcooked. This step concentrates herbs and lemon flavor. Serve immediately; resting chicken in warm place retains juiciness. Common traps: overcrowding pan leads to steaming chicken, underbrowning dulls flavor base, neglecting sauce reduction leaves watery dinner. Quick fix for watery sauce—uncover and raise heat; too thick—add stock carefully. Keep tasting through finale for seasoning control."
tips:
- "Marinating chicken brightens flavor. Use other acids like lime or vinegar if no lemons. Important step for tenderness, pH helps protein break down."
- "Drain marinated chicken well. Avoid steam during browning. Better crust, flaky texture if flour clings without excess moisture. Oil temp matters."
- "Browning in batches is key. Prevent steaming. Sizzle makes things crispy. Watch color, golden edges means flavor is building. Don't rush."
- "Shallots instead of onions avoid sweetness. Brings out acidity from the wine. Key to clarity in sauce. Adds depth without overpowering."
- "Deglazing is crucial. Scrape bottom after browning chicken, lift bits stuck to pot. Those bits carry deep flavor. Don’t skip this part."
faq:
- "q: What if chicken isn’t browning? a: Oil temp too low. Increase heat slightly. Key for Maillard reaction. Look for golden color."
- "q: Can I use skin-on chicken? a: Yes, different texture and fat. Adjust cooking time slightly. Skin will render more moisture."
- "q: How do I know when chicken is done? a: Meat pulls away from bone easily. Use fork, poke and check. Juices should run clear."
- "q: Storage options for leftovers? a: Store in fridge for up to three days. Can freeze, but texture changes slightly. Reheat gently."
