ingredients:
- "160 g (approx 5.5 oz) frozen whole sardines, partial thaw only, scales gently scraped"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) green olives pitted and roughly chopped"
- "2 cloves garlic, finely minced"
- "3 ml (1/4 tsp) red pepper flakes"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) vegetable oil"
- "1 can 796 ml (28 oz) Italian whole peeled tomatoes"
- "10 g (1/4 cup) fresh dill leaves shredded"
- "10 g (1/4 cup) fresh parsley leaves chopped"
- "10 g (1/4 cup) fresh oregano leaves"
instructions:
- "Partial thaw sardines under cold running water. Using the blunt edge of a knife, rub off scales carefully, keeping flesh intact. Pat dry on paper towels."
- "Trim fins with kitchen scissors. Lay sardines flat. Using serrated bread knife, remove heads. Then fillet by sliding knife alongside backbone removing fillets cleanly. Gut fish together with viscera removal. Rinse briefly, dry thoroughly."
- "Heat oil on medium-high in large skillet. Add sardine fillets and olives. Stir in garlic and chili flakes. Sauté until fish just sears without breaking apart, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove fish, keep warm on plate."
- "Pour tomatoes into skillet. Crush with wooden spoon to break up. Bring to boil. Reduce to low, cover loosely with splatter guard. Simmer 25-30 minutes until sauce thickens and reduces slightly."
- "Return sardines to sauce carefully, nestle in. Adjust seasoning for salt and acidity. Heat through gently. Remove from stove."
- "At serving, scatter fresh dill, parsley, oregano over top. Best served with boiled baby potatoes or rustic bread to mop sauce."
introduction: "Sardines, quick and hands-on. Scale scraped just right, fish not fully thawed. Olives instead of capers, oregano swapping basil gives a twist. Garlic and chili sit in oil, then the fish hits the pan, just a quick sear. Tomatoes crushed slowly simmer down into thick rich sauce, fish nestled back in. A handful of fresh herbs chopped fine, sprinkled on top. Rustic, bold, no fuss. Goes well with potatoes or fresh bread. Gluten and dairy free, simple pantry staples. Sharp, herbal, slightly spicy. Mediterranean feel but quick enough for weeknight. Fish guts gone, bones out, just clean fillets. The timing tinkles - a few minutes here and there added or taken. Choppy steps but precise in flavor punch."
ingredientsNote: "Frozen sardines good if partially thawed only; easier to scale that way. Olives bring salt and slight bitterness rather than capers' tartness. Oregano replaces basil with more pungency, earthiness. Use good canned Italian tomatoes for rich sauce base. Garlic and chili flakes for punch, adjust chili to taste. Fresh herbs at end for aroma, not cooked long. Vegetable oil neutral; olive oil works if preferred but smoke point lower. Quantity tweaks lower sardines and chili slightly from original but keep balance."
instructionsNote: "Scaling fish gently to keep skin intact helps when filleting. Using serrated knife to cut mostly frozen fish gives clean fillets. Remove viscera carefully to avoid bitterness. Sauté fish quickly on medium high to get browning without falling apart; olives added alongside for salty contrast. Simmer tomatoes gently with splatter guard, timing adjusted +/- 5 minutes for sauce consistency. Return fish gently so fillets stay whole, adjust seasoning last because sauce concentrates as cooks. Sprinkle fresh herbs right before serving to maximize flavor impact. Serve hot with boiled new potatoes or crusty rustic bread; spoon sauce generously."
tips:
- "Sardines frozen help with scaling. Partial thaw only. Makes it easier. Use blunt edge knife for scraping. Skin stays intact. Preserve the fillet."
- "Use a serrated knife for fish. Cuts cleanly through partially frozen fish. A smooth technique ensures better fillets. Take your time with heads and viscera."
- "Oregano offers different flavor profile. More earthy and pungent than basil. Adjust quantities to your taste. Chili can be stronger or milder according to preference."
- "Thick sauce needs low simmer. 25 to 30 minutes is key. Cover loosely to prevent splattering. Stir occasionally while cooking."
- "Fresh herbs last. Sprinkle right before serving. Keeps flavor vibrant. Dill, parsley, oregano elevate dish. Match with boiled potatoes or crusty bread."
faq:
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Place in airtight container. Refrigerate for maximum three days. Can freeze but texture changes. Use within month for best results."
- "q: Can I use fresh sardines? a: Yes, if available do it. Adjust timing. Fresh cooks faster. Check doneness carefully. Try different flavors if you like."
- "q: What to do if sauce is too thin? a: Simmer longer to thicken. Stir often to not burn. Add small amounts of tomato paste for quick fix."
- "q: What alternatives for olives? a: Capers can work if needed. Different flavor profile. Or omit them for simpler flavor. Choose what you like."
