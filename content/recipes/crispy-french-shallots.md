ingredients:
- "30 g semolina flour"
- "3 shallots, thinly sliced into rings"
- "avocado oil for frying about 3 cm depth"
- "Himalayan pink salt to taste"
- "freshly cracked black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Pour avocado oil into a heavy small pan to cover bottom about 3 cm deep. Heat over medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking."
- "Line a tray with several layers of paper towels."
- "Spread semolina in a shallow bowl."
- "Toss sliced shallots in semolina, shake off excess flour but keep coating even."
- "Once oil hot, fry shallots in batches to avoid overcrowding. Cook each batch 4 to 6 minutes, stirring gently until golden and crisp."
- "Use slotted spoon to remove shallots. Drain on paper towels. Season immediately with salt and cracked pepper."
- "Repeat until all shallots fried."
- "Serve warm or room temperature as garnish, snack, or side."
introduction: "French shallots chopped thin. Coated in semolina, not regular flour. Why? Crunchier crust, nuttier bite. Avocado oil swaps canola here. Higher smoke point, richer flavor. Heat oil enough to shimmer, not burn. Fry shallots slices short bursts, 4-6 minutes until crisp golden. Watching oil temp matters. Too hot burns, too low makes soggy. Season fresh, Himalayan salt and cracked pepper. Simple snack or garnished topper on salads and stews. No dairy, no nuts, vegan friendly. Tripled shallots from 2 up to 3 for more volume and crisp. Semolina over all purpose flour changes texture. Time lengthened to sync with thicker oil depth. Kitchen smells go nutty and sweet. Serve right away or wait cool. Good snack or crunchy salad topper. "
ingredientsNote: "Semolina flour replaces basic all-purpose flour here for more textured crust. Use enough semolina to coat but avoid clumps. Shallots must be thinly sliced for even cooking and crisp results. Avocado oil provides high smoke point and mild taste, better than neutral canola. Canola also works but less flavor. Himalayan pink salt offers a subtle mineral twist compared to plain table salt. Cracked black pepper fresh ground brightens flavor dramatically. Adjust oil depth around 3 cm to avoid soaking, keep heat steady. Shallots volumized from original 2 to 3, semolina reduced slightly to 30 g from 40 g. "
instructionsNote: "Heat oil medium-high, allow shimmer before frying. Fry shallots in small batches to keep oil temp steady and avoid soggy layers. Stir carefully mid-fry to achieve even color. Removing immediately to paper towels prevents excess oiliness. Season hot to maximize salt adherence. Total frying per batch 4-6 minutes, slightly longer than original 3-5 minutes due to oil depth and semolina thickness. Let cool briefly before serving. Don’t overcrowd pan or shallots stick together. Adjust oil amounts based on frying pan size and shallots quantity. The slight increase in oil depth demands patience for oil temp recovery between batches. Use slotted spoon or spider for easy removal. This method ensures golden, crisp shallots every time."
tips:
- "Thin shallots are key. Cut them into rings, even thickness matters. It helps them cook uniformly. This gives a better crunch. Keep it consistent. Semolina can clump. Coat evenly. Avoid thick coating. This tech ensures crisp. Watch the frying temp. If oil smokes, it’s too hot. Adjust heat. Too low makes soggy. Flour isn’t used, semolina over all-purpose."
- "Using avocado oil makes it nutty, better flavor. Heat it right to shimmer. Not burn. Frying shallots in small batches. Avoid overcrowding. Stick together otherwise. Stir gently for even cooking. Take them out with a slotted spoon. Drain excess oil, use paper towels. Season while hot. Salt sticks better. Pink salt adds a twist."
- "Timing matters. Each batch takes about 4-6 minutes. Keep an eye. Don’t rush. Let oil recover heat. More thickness means longer frying. Less than ideal makes sogginess. Keep sprucing up flavors with seasoning. Cracked pepper heightens taste. Don’t skip this part. Adjust oil depth according to your pan size. Just enough to fry."
- "Storage isn’t straightforward. These crispy shallots are best fresh. If stored, keep in an airtight container. Let cool before sealing. They lose crunch if wrapped too tightly. Refrigeration might make them soggy. Reheat in oven for crispness. Don’t microwave, it ruins texture. Leftovers can last for days but are less crunchy."
faq:
- "q: Can I use onions? a: Yes, onions can work. Cut them thin too. Might need longer fry time. Flavor differs, shallots are sweeter. Use red or white as desired. Adjust timing for crispness."
- "q: What if my shallots burn? a: Too hot emits burnt flavor. Check oil temp. It’s key. If it smokes, turn down heat. Less time frying. Stay close to stove to monitor."
- "q: Can I use something else for frying? a: Avocado oil is great. But feel free to use canola. It’s lighter. Just less flavor. Or go for grapeseed oil too. Both have high smoke points."
- "q: How to keep them crispy after frying? a: Drain on paper towels immediately. Let cool in air. Airtight container could ruin. Don’t try refrigerating. Best to eat right away."
