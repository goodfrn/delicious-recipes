Garnished with fresh mint, a surprising cool twist to the bright lemon and rich textures."

ingredients:
- "2 medium zucchini, grated using large box grater holes"
- "3 tbsp unsalted butter"
- "100g guanciale, diced (sub pancetta if unavailable)"
- "2 medium shallots, finely chopped"
- "3 garlic cloves, minced"
- "1 tsp fine sea salt plus more"
- "1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper"
- "1/4 tsp red chili flakes"
- "Zest of 2 lemons"
- "Juice of 2 lemons, freshly squeezed"
- "1/4 cup heavy cream"
- "1/4 cup whole-milk ricotta"
- "3/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, plus extra for garnish"
- "400g fettuccine (sub linguine or spaghetti)"
- "Fresh mint leaves, chopped for garnish"
- "Extra starchy pasta water reserved from cooking"
instructions:
- "Grate zucchini on the coarse side of a box grater. Squeeze out as much water as possible in batches using a clean kitchen towel or cheesecloth. Too wet and sauce won't thicken properly."
- "Melt butter over medium in large skillet. Toss in diced guanciale and shallots. Cook, stirring often, 4-6 minutes or until shallots soften and guanciale renders fat, but don’t let shallots color too much. Smell before adding next ingredients; sweet sharpness."
- "Add garlic, salt, pepper, chili flakes and lemon zest. Stir briskly to wake up aromatics. Keep heat moderate; garlic burns fast here."
- "Introduce zucchini with a generous pinch of salt. Stir to coat. Cover pan tightly. Cook on low, stirring every 5 minutes to avoid scorching, totaling about 25 minutes. Texture should shift from raw to thick, shiny, jam-like—sometimes a bit sticky but not burnt. Patience here makes difference."
- "Meanwhile bring large pot salted water to boil. Cook fettuccine until al dente per package (usually ~8 minutes). Save about 1 ½ cups pasta water before draining."
- "Uncover zucchini mixture. Stir in lemon juice, heavy cream, ricotta, and ½ cup reserved pasta water. Blend well; sauce should loosen and coat spatula thickly."
- "Add drained pasta straight into skillet. Toss vigorously to marry pasta and sauce. Add pasta water in increments until sauce clings but doesn’t pool. You want silk coating every strand, not swimmy noodles."
- "Taste, adjust salt, pepper, chili flakes. Fold in chopped fresh mint. Why mint? Cuts richness, adds freshness, unexpected but works perfect with lemon and rich pork notes."
- "Serve immediately topped with extra Parmigiano and mint. No waiting; cream sauce stiffens quickly once off heat."
introduction: "Shredded zucchini, cooked low and slow until it turns uber thick and jammy—this is kitchen science you can taste. That tactile change is the signal to add cream, the taste of lemon zest and juice waking up the pan. Guanciale replaces pancetta here because its fattiness hits more umami notes, but if you only have pancetta, no drama. Shallots soften gently to a sweetness that balances the garlic punch. Fettuccine swaps in for linguine to hold more sauce on each strand. Fresh mint at the end, a twist borrowed from summer pastas, a little cool contrast that slices through richness. Keep an eye on the zucchini texture and trust your senses—too watery and your sauce won't hold. No shortcuts, no skipping those stir intervals. It takes time but the payoff is a dish with layers of flavor and luscious mouthfeel that punches well above its humble ingredients."
ingredientsNote: "Zucchini’s water content varies wildly—always squeeze it well or your sauce ends up watery. If you don’t have guanciale, use good-quality pancetta or even thick-cut bacon, but reduce salt in recipe accordingly. Ricotta cuts the heavy cream in half without sacrificing the silkiness, keeping things balanced while adding a delicate tang. Fresh herbs? Mint works unexpectedly here, but basil or oregano could do. Lemon zest and juice both essential—zest for aroma, juice for brightness. Garlic minced fresh not powder, garlic burns fast here so low heat after adding important. Always reserve pasta water. Its starch thickens and smooths sauce, a critical lifesaver if your sauce feels clumpy or too thick."
instructionsNote: "Grate zucchini coarse, then squeeze dry with a towel to avoid watery mess. Cook guanciale slowly so fat renders but don’t scorch shallots—light caramelization here adds foundational sweet flavor without bitterness. Keep garlic addition quick and gentle to avoid burning, which ruins aroma. Cover zucchini to steam and break down; stirring intermittently prevents sticking and burning. Look for a change to a sticky, thick jam texture—not mushy, not watery. Timing varies with zucchini freshness so trust sight and texture over clock. Pasta water is your textural savior—use judiciously to hit right consistency. When tossing pasta into sauce off heat, move fast to coat evenly before sauce firms up. Adding fresh mint last preserves its brightness and adds a culinary twist on a lemon-scented classic."
tips:
- "Grate zucchini well, then squeeze. Too much water wrecks sauce consistency. Use clean towel, cheesecloth. Patience here really matters. Jam is the goal."
- "Guanciale brings flavor, but pancetta works. Reduce salt if using pancetta. More umami with the guanciale. Crisp it slowly for best results."
- "Keep garlic on low heat. It burns quickly. Brown garlic ruins flavor. Mix it in after other aromatics. Timing is key; don’t rush"
- "Zucchini texture changes are the cue. After 25 minutes, look for that jammy thickness. If still watery, keep cooking. Stir often; avoid sticking."
- "Reserve pasta water. Half a cup/minimum is essential for sauce. Adds starchiness to sauce—makes it cling to pasta. Adjust as needed during toss."
faq:
- "q: Why is my sauce watery? a: Zucchini needs to be dried thoroughly before cooking. Squeeze it well. If too wet, sauce won’t hold."
- "q: Can I substitute guanciale? a: Yes, pancetta or even bacon is fine. Adjust salt downward; add smokiness differently. Flavor will shift."
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Refrigerate for about 3 days. Reheat gently on low. Be careful not to overcook cream. Sauce can separate."
- "q: What if I have no ricotta? a: You can skip it, but balance sauce with more cream. Creaminess won’t be as light, but it’ll be fine."
