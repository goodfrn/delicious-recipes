ingredients:
- "=== Meatballs ==="
- "2 large eggs"
- "200 ml (3/4 cup plus 1 tbsp) whole milk"
- "90 g (1 cup) panko breadcrumbs"
- "900 g (2 lb) lean ground pork"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) toasted sesame oil"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) gochujang chili paste"
- "2 garlic cloves, grated finely"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) kosher salt"
- "freshly ground black pepper, to taste"
- "=== Salad ==="
- "1 Persian cucumber, thinly sliced on mandoline"
- "1 medium carrot, thin ribbons with peeler"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) rice vinegar"
- "Fresh cilantro leaves, to garnish"
- "=== Sauce ==="
- "80 ml (1/3 cup) low-sodium soy sauce"
- "60 g (1/4 cup plus 1 tbsp) dark brown sugar"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) toasted sesame seeds"
- "10 ml (2 tsp) toasted sesame oil"
instructions:
- "=== Meatballs ==="
- "1. Center oven rack, preheat to 215 °C (420 °F). Line sheet pan with silicone mat or parchment paper."
- "2. Whisk eggs, milk, and panko in large bowl; let soak 6 minutes. Don't skip soak; it holds moisture, keeps meatballs tender."
- "3. Add pork, sesame oil, gochujang, garlic, salt, and pepper. Use hands to mix until just combined. Don't overwork; tough meatballs start here."
- "4. Use 60 ml (1/4 cup) scoop to portion meat. Wet hands lightly to shape into balls without sticking. Place on prepared pan. Yields 20 sizeable meatballs (note reduction). If you want smaller, adjust but watch cooking time."
- "5. Bake 27–30 minutes until golden crust forms, juices run clear, and internal temp hits 70 °C (160 °F). Tap a meatball; firm but springy signals doneness."
- "6. Optional pause: Freeze raw meatballs on tray, then bag. Freeze up to 2 months. Bake straight from frozen; add 10-15 minutes, watch for dryness."
- "=== Salad ==="
- "7. Toss cucumber slices and carrot ribbons with rice vinegar in bowl. Salt lightly and pepper. Let macerate minimum 5 minutes, up to 20. Drain just before serving to avoid sogginess."
- "8. Cilantro adds brightness. Add last minute. No cilantro? Mint or Thai basil can play substitute roles—adjust quantity to avoid overpowering."
- "=== Sauce ==="
- "9. In heavy skillet, combine soy, brown sugar, toasted sesame seeds, sesame oil. Bring to vigorous simmer over medium heat. Stir often; sugar will melt, sauce thickens within 4 minutes."
- "10. Once syrupy and bubbles slow, add baked meatballs gently to pan. Spoon sauce over to glaze thoroughly without breaking meatballs."
- "11. Warm through, 2–3 minutes. Avoid boiling vigorously; sugar can burn and get bitter."
- "12. Plate: Spoon meatballs with glossy sauce onto shallow bowls. Nestle salad alongside—drain so dressing doesn’t dilute sauce. Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves."
- "13. Serve with sticky rice or steamed jasmine. Avoid tossing meatballs in salad; flavors compete and texture suffers."
introduction: "Lean ground pork, a bit of spice, and sesame oil for that roasted depth. Not your usual messy meatball collapse thanks to soaking panko first. Eggs and milk meld crumbs to protein for moist interiors. Oven baking gets that fine crust with less mess than pan-frying, no splatter battles or oil rationing. The crunch of fresh cucumber ribbons tempered with sweet rice vinegar tames rich meatballs. Heat from gochujang sneaks in, balanced by sticky brown sugar soy sauce. Coriander freshness as contrast. Cool, vibrant salad meets warm, umami-laden bites. This is balance. Simple steps, smart tweaks."
ingredientsNote: "Panko is critical here; regular breadcrumbs weigh down. Adjust milk slightly if panko looks dry, but don't oversoak — mushy mix means flat meatballs. Go for lean pork to avoid greasy fallout. Short on gochujang? Sambal oelek or chili garlic paste works, but tweak quantity—less sweet, more burn. Sesame oil toasted and fresh delivers nuttiness — avoid pale sesame oil, it’s flat. Brown sugar sways caramelized sauce; dark is preferred, but light or coconut sugar substitute okay if measured carefully. For cucumbers, Persian or English work best; seedless or small-seeded varies texture. Coriander optional but highly recommended; use herbs fresh. Frozen meatballs hold well; separate on tray before bagging prevents collapsing."
instructionsNote: "Preheat fully before baking; meatballs need consistent heat to form crust quickly, locking juices inside. Shaping with wet hands prevents sticky fingers and maintains meatball integrity—too dry, crumbly; too wet, slippery. Bake on lined sheet for even browning, minimal cleanup. Recognize doneness by golden color, firm bounce, and internal temp (use thermometer if unsure). Sauce reduction demands attention—low and slow prevents burning sugar glaze. Adding meatballs to sauce off heat risks tofu texture; warm pan cooks just enough. Salad: max crispness with quick macerating and draining prevents sogginess next to warm meatballs. Timing steps so meatballs rest briefly after baking allows juices to redistribute, no immediate cutting. Floating coriander leaves last minute for vibrant look and punch. Don't rush any step; the payoff is texture and layered flavors, not a rush job."
tips:
- "Start by preheating. Oven must be hot; not halfway warmed. Meatballs need steady heat. Look for golden crust; it means the juices stay inside. Use a thermometer. It helps catch any undercooked spots."
- "Mix meat gently. Overworking is bad. Texture suffers, and meatballs get tough. Keep hands wet while shaping. It cuts sticking; no mess. Don't ignore the resting time after baking."
- "Adjust soak time for panko. Too long makes paste; too short means dry mix. Watch the balance. If ground pork feels too lean, mix with a touch of beef. Adds fat, flavor."
- "Cucumber slices must be thin. Use mandoline for uniformity. If too thick, crunch is lost; soggy bits can happen. Drain well after soaking in vinegar; soggy salad is no good."
- "Need alternatives for gochujang? Try sambal oelek or chili garlic sauce instead. Adjust the quantity, less heat, more vinegar maybe. Don't scrap the flavor; sauce takes time and attention."
faq:
- "q: How to know if meatballs are done? a: Look for golden brown outside. Firmness counts too. Gently press; it should spring back. Juice running clear is key. Use thermometer for 70 °C."
- "q: Can I use other meats? a: Yes, ground chicken works but watch fat content. If too lean, add soaked panko to keep moisture. Turkey can dry out; adjust cook times."
- "q: What's the best way to store leftovers? a: Store in an airtight container. Refrigerate up to 3 days. Can freeze up to 2 months. Reheat in oven to maintain texture, avoid microwaving."
- "q: What if my sauce is too thick? a: Add water or low-sodium soy sauce to thin out. It should pour, not glop. Whisk in slowly to control the thickness."
