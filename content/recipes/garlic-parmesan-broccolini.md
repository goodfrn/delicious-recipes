ingredients:
- "1 bunch broccolini trimmed"
- "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil divided"
- "3 cloves garlic minced"
- "1/4 cup shaved Pecorino Romano cheese"
- "fine sea salt to taste"
- "freshly ground black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Preheat broiler on high. Line rimmed baking sheet with foil for easy cleanup; broccolini will crisp and may mark pan."
- "Spread broccolini evenly on pan. Use 1 tablespoon olive oil to coat stalks thoroughly by hand; toss gently to avoid bruising fragile tips."
- "Season with sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper. Don't be shy here. Those simple seasonings matter for flavor depth under heat."
- "Place pan 6 inches under broiler. Roast for roughly 10 to 12 minutes depending on stalk thickness and broiler intensity. Watch carefully once the tips start to brown and edges curl slightly."
- "While broccolini cooks, mix remaining olive oil with minced garlic in small bowl. Careful to mince finely, so garlic distributes evenly without large pungent chunks."
- "Once broccolini is removed from oven, immediately toss with garlic oil mixture, stirring to coat while still hot, which unlocks the aroma without burning raw garlic’s bite."
- "Sprinkle shaved Pecorino Romano over top. The residual heat melts cheese slightly, adding salty tang and texture contrast."
- "Serve right away. Will lose crispness if held. Texture is crisp tender with just enough char. If broccolini goes limp, fast reheat under broiler 1-2 minutes but watch closely."
- "If using asparagus instead, increase broil time 1-2 minutes or until similar caramelization on tips. For oil substitute, avocado oil or light grapeseed can be used but olive oil gives best flavor match."
- "Avoid overcooking to prevent mushy stalks; listen for faint crackling as broccolini chars. Garlic must be minced fine to avoid bitter bites—if worried, infuse oil warm on stove briefly before mixing."
- "Leftovers reheat poorly; best eaten fresh but can be served cold in salads for a fibrous crunch with creamy cheese mellowness."
introduction: "Broccolini takes a quick turn under the broiler for a punchy side dish that's anything but boring. The natural green sweetness gets a smoky edge as the tips blister and char. Garlic infuses the oil, turning fragrant but not harsh. Pecorino Romano—sharp, salty, aged—adds a savory layer once the stalks come out hot. Timing here is flexible but crucial; you want crisp-tender stalks, not limp or burned. Easy to get wrong if you just leave it in the oven. Watch textures and smell cues—the faint sizzle is your friend. Simple ingredients, skilled manipulations. Swap out broccolini for asparagus or even thin green beans. Olive oil is best but other neutral oils won't kill it. You just want enough fat to promote caramelization without greasiness. This is more technique than ingredient list. Knowing when to pull from heat or toss with garlic oil while warm makes or breaks the experience. You learn by doing."
ingredientsNote: "Broccolini works here because it’s thinner and more delicate than asparagus; cooks faster, chars more evenly. Trim tough ends or peel larger stalks to prevent woody bites. Garlic should be finely minced or crushed to release aroma without raw harshness. Pecorino Romano chosen for its sharp, salty profile; Parmesan or Asiago can substitute though flavor shifts. Extra virgin olive oil ideal for flavor and smoke point balance—use light olive oil or avocado oil if higher heat tolerance desired. Sea salt pulls moisture from the stalks for better caramelization; kosher salt is good alternative. Fresh cracked black pepper adds bite and depth. Key to success is not using pre-minced garlic which can burn or taste off. Keep ingredients fresh to marry flavors intact."
instructionsNote: "Broiler temperature and closeness vary; pan placement matters. Keep the broccolini spread evenly on a foil-lined baking sheet to promote even cooking and cleanup. Toss with the initial olive oil and seasonings prior to broiling to ensure each stalk browns nicely. Broil timing fluctuates—look for tips turning golden brown and stalks changing from raw green to deeper shade but still rigid when poked. Use your ears for a gentle crackle that signals Maillard reactions. Mixing garlic oil immediately after removing from heat allows garlic aroma to meld without frying raw garlic into bitterness. When adding Pecorino, residual heat softens and slightly melts it—adding creamy texture and salt punch. Serve fast; letting rest makes broccolini soggy. If uncertain about doneness, cut one stalk at the thick end to check for tender snap. For leftovers, reheating quickly under broiler recovers some crispness but eat fresh whenever possible."
tips:
- "Trim broccolini ends for even cooking. And if thick stalks, peel them. Reduces woody bites. Remember, thinner cooks faster. Timing is key."
- "Watch closely; broiler intensity varies. Keep broccolini 6 inches under heat. Look for slight blistering and crispy edges. Don't leave it alone."
- "Garlic oil; mince finely. Avoid raw chunks that burn. Infuse oil low on stove for a gentler touch if worried. Garlic aroma, that's what you want."
- "Heat of pan and placement matters. Foil helps with cleanup, but also helps distribute heat. Broccolini should be spread out, not crowded."
- "Leftovers? Best eaten fresh, but if needed, cold in salads. Can reheat under broiler fast but crispy is tough with reheats. Aim for fresh."
faq:
- "q: How long to broil broccolini? a: Depends on thickness. 10-12 minutes is typical. Monitor closely; look for browning and crisp edges."
- "q: Can I use different oil? a: Yes, avocado or grapeseed works too. Olive gives best flavor but others won’t ruin it. Fat is crucial for caramelization."
- "q: What if my broccolini is soggy? a: Pull from heat sooner next time. Aim for a gentle crackle when cooking. Avoid overcooking to prevent limpness."
- "q: Can I store leftover broccolini? a: Yes but messy. Best eaten fresh. If storing, cold is better. Warm up—quickly under broiler if needed."
