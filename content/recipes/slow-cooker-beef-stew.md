description: "Chunky beef cubes, talc-dry, floured, and seasoned. Browned sharply in hot oil for a sear that locks flavor. Carrots, celery, onions, and small Yukon Gold potatoes layered over. A broth built thick with tomato paste, red wine swap with dry sherry, beef stock, Worcestershire, and a splash of apple cider vinegar. Fresh rosemary swapped for savory. Herbs tied with bay leaves. Slow cooked low for 7–9 hours until meat shreds easily, veggies soften but not mush. Thickened with a cornstarch slurry plus frozen pearl onions instead of peas. Butter stirred in last for creaminess. Ruled with chopped fresh tarragon or parsley. Serve hot with toasted sourdough or buttered noodles. Hearty, rustic, no guesswork."

ingredients:
- "2 ½ lbs chuck beef, cut into 1 ½ inch cubes"
- "Kosher salt, to taste"
- "Fresh ground black pepper, to taste"
- "½ cup all-purpose flour"
- "3 tablespoons vegetable oil (can substitute with grapeseed or avocado oil)"
- "1 large yellow onion, chopped"
- "3 garlic cloves, minced"
- "4 medium carrots, sliced on a bias"
- "3 celery stalks, chopped"
- "1 ½ lbs Yukon Gold potatoes, quartered"
- "3 tablespoons tomato paste"
- "1 cup dry sherry (sub for red wine for deeper, slightly sweeter notes)"
- "4 cups low-sodium beef broth (or use concentrated beef base diluted for a richer flavor)"
- "1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce"
- "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard"
- "1 ½ tablespoons apple cider vinegar (replaces balsamic for brightness)"
- "1 teaspoon dried thyme"
- "2 teaspoons dried savory (swap for rosemary to avoid bitterness)"
- "1 teaspoon dried parsley"
- "2 bay leaves"
- "3 tablespoons cornstarch"
- "3 tablespoons cold water"
- "1 cup frozen pearl onions (instead of peas for a sweet crunch)"
- "3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter"
- "Fresh tarragon or parsley, chopped for garnish"
instructions:
- "=== Prepare and brown beef ==="
- "Pat beef chunks thoroughly dry with paper towels; moisture kills sear. Season generously with salt and black pepper. Dust with flour until lightly coated but not clumpy. This crust helps form a roux layer later in cooking. Heat oil in a heavy skillet on medium-high until just smoking. Don’t crowd pan; sear in batches. Brown each side about 45 seconds until crust forms. No gray spots. Transfer browned beef into base of 6-quart slow cooker."
- "=== Vegetable layering ==="
- "Scatter chopped onions, minced garlic, carrots, celery, potatoes evenly over beef. Spread for even cooking and heat penetration."
- "=== Building the broth ==="
- "In a bowl, whisk tomato paste into dry sherry. Add beef broth, Worcestershire, Dijon mustard, apple cider vinegar; season with pinch more salt and pepper. Stir in thyme, savory, parsley. Pour this aromatic pool over meat and veggies. Nestle in bay leaves. Avoid stirring now; let flavors merge undisturbed."
- "=== Slow cook low and slow ==="
- "Cover slow cooker lid tightly. Cook on low for 7 to 9 hours, checking visual cues after 7 hours: beef should pull apart with minimal resistance—fork tender, not mush. Vegetables should be tender but hold shape—potatoes just start to flake, carrots soft but resilient. If beef resists, add 30 mins more; watch consistency."
- "=== Thickening stage ==="
- "When done, mix cornstarch with cold water to form a smooth slurry. Stir gently into stew along with frozen pearl onions. Replace lid; let simmer in residual heat for about 12 to 15 minutes until broth thickens and pearl onions turn translucent but keep bite."
- "=== Final enrichment ==="
- "Drop cold butter cubes into stew just before serving. Stir to melt; adds silky texture and rounds acidity."
- "=== Serving ==="
- "Ladle into warmed bowls. Sprinkle freshly chopped tarragon or parsley on top. Best with toasted sourdough slices or buttered noodles to soak up juices. Enjoy the gentle clatter of spoons and melting mouthfeel."
introduction: "Beef stew demands respect. Dry meat—simple but overlooked—to avoid that weird gray boiling look. Flour coating is old-school but builds a natural thickener so you don’t end up with broth that’s thin and watery. Searing? Non-negotiable. It locks in flavor compounds and gives your stew savory depth. Skip it and you get dull meat and bland liquid. Wine swap with dry sherry for a faint sweetness that cuts through richness. Vinegar? Apple cider here. Keeps the acidity vibrant, not weighed down like balsamic. Vegetables chunked, not mush. Slow cook low until meat’s a tease away from falling apart and veggies keep subtle bite intact. Then thicken with cold slurry—key move for perfect mouthfeel. Butter last—don’t cook butter too long or you kill richness. Toss chopped fresh tarragon or parsley to lift flavors just before serving."
ingredientsNote: "Always start with room temperature beef; cold meat steams rather than browns. Dried herbs hold up better for long slow cooking; fresh lose potency. Carrots and celery add aroma, texture, and sweetness but don’t overchop—they should soften, not dissolve. Yukon Gold potatoes used for creamy texture without crumbling like Russets. Pearls onions replace peas for a touch of crunch and sweetness that cuts richness. Tomato paste anchors umami and color. Red wine can be tricky if weak or cheap; dry sherry adds complex notes but keep alcohol levels moderate. Vinegar acidity brightens the stew, balancing collagen-rich beef and butter. Flour coating is crucial; helps mix with rendered fat creating natural gravy, avoid clumps by tossing lightly. Cornstarch slurry must be mixed cold to prevent lumps and added near end to preserve clarity."
instructionsNote: "Searing is vital—hot pan, no crowded batches, and don’t stir too soon. You want those crackly browned bits, called fond, stuck to pan for flavor. Layer vegetables evenly, don’t bury beef too deep to allow juices to mingle. Slow cooker lids vary—if yours vents steam, expect the stew to thicken a little slower, adjust times accordingly. Fork test triumphed over timers. Don't overcook veggies into oblivion; they should still have structure. Slurry added last helps you control thickness precisely, unlike flour dumped at first which can turn pasty. Stir slurry in thoroughly but gently, then seal and let residual heat work. Butter added at end thickens and enriches without breaking down. Garnishes aren’t optional; fresh herbs brighten the slow-cooked intensity and present like a semi-fresh finish against rustic hunks."
tips:
- "Start with dry beef, moisture ruins a good sear. Dust beef with flour lightly. This helps with roux. Don't crowd the pan while searing. Good crust is key for depth."
- "Layer veggies carefully. Ensure even distribution. Onions, garlic, and root vegetables retain structure. Watch cooking time. Too soft ruins texture. Keep it chunky."
- "For broth, whisk in tomato paste until smooth. Add sherry, broth. Don't stir after pouring. Let it merge naturally. Bay leaves whole, they'll infuse over time."
- "Slow cook on low, check at 7 hours. Beef should pull apart easily. Don't overcook veggies. Aim for fork-tender, not mush. 30 more mins if underdone."
- "Cornstarch slurry should be mixed cold. Add last. Thickens while preserving clarity. Too soon and stew turns pasty. Stir gently but thoroughly. Include cold butter for richness last."
faq:
- "q: What's the best beef cut? a: Chuck is ideal—fatty, tender when slow-cooked. Flank or brisket work but less flavor."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool stew completely. Transfer to airtight container. Refrigerate for up to 3 days. Freeze up to 3 months."
- "q: What if stew is too salty? a: Add a peeled potato. It absorbs some salt. Other options: more broth or water. Balance flavors."
- "q: Can I make it gluten-free? a: Swap flour for cornstarch. Toss beef in that instead. Follow same searing technique. Avoid flour for thickening."
