ingredients:
- "=== Rice ==="
- "240 g (1⅔ cups) cooked jasmine rice cold, preferably day-old"
- "25 ml (1½ tbsp) red curry paste"
- "25 ml (1½ tbsp) neutral oil like canola"
- "=== Pork ==="
- "400 g (14 oz) ground pork, lean"
- "12 ml (¾ tbsp) vegetable oil"
- "25 ml (1½ tbsp) minced fresh ginger"
- "1 large garlic clove, minced"
- "25 ml (1½ tbsp) low-sodium soy sauce"
- "=== Salad ==="
- "Zest and juice of 1 juicy lime"
- "8 ml (1½ tsp) brown sugar packed"
- "4 ml (¾ tsp) fish sauce (sub oyster sauce or extra soy if needed)"
- "1 medium English cucumber, sliced thin half-moons"
- "3 scallions, sliced thin"
- "50 g (⅓ cup) dry roasted unsalted peanuts, roughly chopped"
- "25 g (¼ cup) dried unsweetened shredded coconut, toasted"
- "10 g (⅓ cup) fresh mint leaves torn"
- "Lime wedges to serve"
instructions:
- "=== Rice ==="
- "Preheat oven to 210 °C (410 °F). Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Toss cold rice with curry paste and oil until evenly coated. Season with salt. Spread rice thinly in an even layer—important to avoid steaming. Roast 22 to 27 minutes, stirring halfway. Look for deep golden brown with random darker spots—rice should crackle when pressed."
- "=== Pork ==="
- "While rice roasts, heat oil in heavy skillet over medium-high. Add pork, breaking up lumps constantly. When pork starts to brown around edges, about 7–9 minutes, add ginger and garlic. Stir and cook 2–3 minutes until fragrant. Splash in soy, stir 1 minute more to glaze meat. Season with black pepper; skip extra salt as soy is salty enough. Remove from heat."
- "=== Salad ==="
- "Mix lime zest, lime juice, brown sugar, fish sauce, and 20 ml (1 tbsp) oil in bowl. Adjust balance—should be tart, sweet, salty. Add cucumber, scallions, peanuts, coconut, and mint. Stir gently, so cucumber stays crisp but all coated well."
- "Combine rice with salad mixture gently in same bowl. Test seasoning; add more lime or sugar if needed."
- "For serving, spread salad on shallow platter. Scatter pork evenly on top for a neat presentation. Serve immediately with lime wedges. The contrast between juicy pork and crisp rice is key—don't let rice sit too long or it loses crunch."
introduction: "Rice salad. Not just any rice salad. Crispy bits of jasmine with tingling red curry paste. The kind of crunch that wakes the mouth. Ground pork cooked till browned, ginger and garlic waft from the pan. Fresh cucumber sliced paper thin for snap. Peanuts—roasted, chopped, punchy. Coconut flakes toasted but subtle, whispers of sweet. Lime juice sharp with zest tangled in. Mint torn last minute, bright and green. Combining hot, cold, soft, hard textures—that’s the goal. No soggy fail here. Timing matters; roasts need patience. Pork needs color, not just heat. Balance. Salt, sweet, sour, savor. Quick, precise. Layers build flavor fast, no fluff."
ingredientsNote: "Switched rice quantity down by 20%. Too much rice kills the assembly; less cooks more evenly on the sheet. Curry paste trimmed slightly to avoid overwhelming heat - test your brand, some pack a punch. Subbed standard veggie oil for varied oil suitability—canola or sunflower work well here for neutral flavor. Ground pork quantity lightened for lean balance, but still enough fat for flavor. Garlic cut to one clove to keep punch without burn risk. Brown sugar lowered, fish sauce slightly reduced to pull back saltiness, alternatives noted for allergen swaps or if fish sauce is missing—oyster or more soy sauce avoid dead-ends. Coconut flakes reduced and toasted separately to prevent burning. Mint quantity adjusted - more overpowering as fresh ingredient, use as garnish if preferred. Peanuts smaller portion—watch nut allergies, swap for roasted pumpkin seeds or toasted soy nuts for crunch without nuts."
instructionsNote: "Flip usual process on its head. Start rice first, slow crisping works better in oven over stovetop fry where uneven coloration kills texture promise. Spread thin layer to get real crunch. Don’t overcrowd pan; moisture traps under thick piles. Pork cooks best alone, separate pan—don’t crowd. Break meat down to increase surface area browning. Don’t rush the color stage; brown means intense flavor. Add aromatics once edges form crust, so garlic and ginger don’t burn into bitterness. Toss pork with soy last minute to seal flavor. Mixing salad, get tastes balanced first before rice joins. Add rice last, gently—crunch is fragile. Serve straight away. Letting sit? Rice softens fast. Keep lime wedges handy for extra zing on the plate. A quick flip through this recipe wins texture and complexity, no soggy mess. Trust your senses watching colors and smells. Loud sizzle, fragrant steam still rising when done."
tips:
- "Start with cold rice. Overnight chilling really helps. Should be dry. Mix with curry paste right before roasting. Spread thin on the sheet to get crunch. Don't overcrowd it. Stir halfway; check color. Should be golden with crackles. If still soft? Roast longer."
- "Pork needs browning. Break it up as it cooks. High heat, lots of movement. Adds flavor. When it just starts coloring, garlic and ginger go in. Watch closely; burnt garlic is bitter. Add soy last minute to coat, avoid oversalting."
- "Coconut can burn fast. Toast it separately, on low. Keep stirring. Just takes minutes to get nice color. Check often. For salad dressing: balance the lime, sugar, fish sauce. Adjust as you go. Should taste bright and zesty."
- "Combine rice and salad gently. Rice is fragile, loses crunch quickly. Serve right away. If it sits too long, sogcity sets in. Get toppings just right—peanuts last to avoid sogginess too. Extra lime on the side helps with flavor."
- "Mint? Use fresh, torn last minute. Brightness makes a difference. Scallions add crunch, but cut them thin. Cucumber—should be paper-thin for the right snap. If looking for nut-free? Pumpkin seeds or soy nuts work well in place of peanuts."
faq:
- "q: What if my rice isn’t crispy? a: Check spread in oven. Thin layer is key. Too thick? Steam builds up. Roast longer; watch color. Cracker-like is the goal."
- "q: Can I use ground turkey instead of pork? a: Sure! Similar method. Turkey cooks drier. Add more oil or moisture to prevent drying out. Watch cooking time."
- "q: Can I make it ahead? a: Best fresh, rice will soften. If must prep, store parts separately. Combine just before serving. Keeps crunch this way."
- "q: How should I store leftovers? a: Fridge in airtight containers. Rice can harden; reheat gently, a splash of water helps revive it. Eat within a couple of days."
