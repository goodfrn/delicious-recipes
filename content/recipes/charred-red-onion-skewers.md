description: "Thick slices of large Spanish red onions threaded on soaked skewers, brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with fresh rosemary. Seasoned simply with sea salt and cracked pepper. Grilled over medium heat until soft with char marks. Aromas sharp, sweet, smoky. Serve off skewers to release sweetness. Uses rosemary instead of thyme. Skewer soak prevents burning. Cook 12 minutes, looking for translucent edges and slight collapse. Best on gas grill or charcoal ember bed. Substitute shallots or white onions for variations. Omit oil for no-fat but watch sticking. A smoky, tender base for salads or sides."

ingredients:
- "3 large Spanish red onions"
- "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil"
- "1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, chopped"
- "Sea salt"
- "Cracked black pepper"
- "Metal or wooden skewers soaked 30 minutes"
instructions:
- "Start by peeling the large red onions. Cut into thick slices, about 1.2 cm (half an inch plus a touch). Don’t go thinner; you want the layers to hold together on the skewers without falling apart mid-grill."
- "Thread the slices carefully onto your skewers. If wooden, soak them at least 30 minutes to prevent charring; metal skewers heat evenly but can get hot, so be cautious."
- "Brush olive oil across each slice generously — this protects and promotes caramelization. Sprinkle chopped rosemary evenly, a fragrant swap for thyme. Salt lightly; pepper just a dash. Seasoning early lets it soak during grilling."
- "Heat grill to medium heat - approx 350-375°F if using gas. Place skewers across grates. Don’t crowd. Listen first: faint sizzle means the oil hits heat, onions start to soften."
- "Cook for about 12 minutes, turning every few minutes. Watch edges turn translucent, tiny blisters form, and slight blackened spots appear. A subtle char smell but not burnt. Texture should yield easily to a fork without collapsing."
- "Keep turning to avoid burning thin edges. If edges blacken too fast, move skewers away from direct flame or lower heat slightly."
- "Remove from grill, slide slices off skewers onto plate. Rest a couple minutes — aroma deepens, sweetness intensifies."
- "Serve warm. Use as a robust base for salads, with fresh herbs, feta or drizzle balsamic vinegar for complexity."
- "Substitutions: Shallots work but cook faster — adjust time to avoid mushiness. White onions hold shape better if preferred."
- "If no grill, oven broiler on medium-high rack for 10 minutes, turning once midway, mimics char. Keep a close eye."
- "No oil option means more frequent flipping and watch for sticking. Use nonstick grill mat or foil with holes punched to reduce stuck onions."
introduction: "Big red onions sliced thick, threaded on skewers after a good soak. Olive oil and fresh rosemary give a punch of aroma, salt, pepper bring out latent sweetness. Fire kiss turns layers from raw bite to tender melt. Charred edges contrast sweet heart. Medium grill heat crucial - too hot burns, too low steams. Watch those onions closely. Achieving balance between smoke, softness, and that caramelized edge. Simple technique, but requires attention. Quick flip every 3-4 minutes. Wooden skewers soak so no flame flare ups. Alternative herbs help swagger the flavor profile - rosemary aromatic, more piney than thyme’s herbal lift. Approach onions like muscle. Respect them. Don't skimp thickness or drip oil. Otherwise, dry or uneven cooking."
ingredientsNote: "Red onions hold up best but any onion will do if sliced thick and treated gently. Fresh herbs increase fragrance; rosemary’s woody notes are sturdier on flames. Olive oil coats and lends fat for caramelization; use a neutral oil if preferred but avoid butter here — higher smoke point oils needed. Metallic skewers conduct heat; wooden skewers safer but soak well to avoid fire hazards. Salt at the start draws moisture, try not to over salting which draws too much juice and weakens slices. Pepper ground fresh just before grilling for best pungency. Timing depends on onion size and grill heat; trust visual and tactile cues rather than clock."
instructionsNote: "Cutting onions thick ensures structural integrity — thinner slices turn to pulp quickly. Skewer threading aligns layers vertically; don’t overcrowd. Oil coating is key — ensures caramelization and prevents sticking. If grill flames flare from dripping oil, shift skewers to indirect heat. Listen for steady sizzle sounds, not crackles of flames. Flipping every 3 minutes encourages even cooks and prevents charring one side. Watch for translucent edges; when knife or fork slides through with light resistance, onions are ready. Resting off heat lets sugars redistribute. If oven broiler used, grill pan or rack needed to allow air circulation; open flame replaces broiler cycles but don’t leave unattended. Handling delicate onion slices requires patience; turn gently with tongs to keep slices intact."
tips:
- "Thick slices keep onions intact on skewers. If too thin, turn to mush. Aim for about 1.2 cm. Layered but firm. Oil prevents sticking; no oil means constant flipping or risk of burning."
- "Scent of rosemary enriches flavor. Fresh herbs are best; sturdier than dried. Experiment with thyme or even sage for different depth. Adjust grilling time for shallots. Cook them faster. Watch closely."
- "Keep an ear out for that sizzle sound. It indicates heat working. If flames hit, shift to indirect heat. Overcrowding leads to steaming instead of grilling. Maintain space."
- "Resting off heat is key. Intensity of sweetness develops after a few minutes. Move gently when serving; preserving shape matters. Sugars redistribute. Provides richer flavor."
- "Using a nonstick grill mat or foil with holes helps avoid sticking. No oil means diligence required. Keep flipping. Watch edges carefully. Dark but not burnt. A smoky hint comes from char."
faq:
- "q: Can I use different onions? a: Yes, but choose thick slices. Shallots cook quick, white onions hold their shape better. Watch those cook times closely."
- "q: What if I don’t have skewers? a: Grill them directly on the grates. Use a grill rack or basket. Helps prevent falling through. Keep an eye on sticking."
- "q: How do I store leftover skewers? a: Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat gently or enjoy cold. Flavor intensifies over time."
- "q: Any flavor variations? a: Try a balsamic glaze for sweetness. Add garlic paste to oil or pepper flakes for kick. Switch herbs to match dishes you're making."
