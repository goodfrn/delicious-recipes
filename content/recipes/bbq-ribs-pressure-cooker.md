description: "Pork back ribs, spice-rubbed, pressure steamed then charred on the grill. Sauce with apple jelly swapped for peach preserves, and Worcestershire replaced by soy sauce for umami depth. Reduced cassonade, bumped chili seasoning, fresh cracked pepper, and smoked paprika added for smokiness. Quick simmer sauce thickens into glossy glaze. Natural pressure release prevents tough meat. Grill finish caramelizes edges, locks juices. Ribs cut in 3-4 bone sections for even cooking. Rack toasted with oil to avoid sticking. Sauce basting keeps surface moist and sticky. Home method to replicate slow smoke in short time."

ingredients:
- "=== Dry Rub ==="
- "21 ml (1 1/2 c. tbsp) light brown sugar"
- "18 ml (1 1/4 c. tbsp) chili powder"
- "12 ml (2 1/2 tsp) kosher salt"
- "4 ml (3/4 tsp) cracked black pepper"
- "2 ml (1/2 tsp) smoked paprika"
- "2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) onion powder"
- "2.3 kg (5 lb) pork back ribs"
- "=== Barbecue Sauce ==="
- "2 ml (1/2 tsp) onion powder"
- "2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) garlic powder"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) unsalted butter"
- "125 ml (1/2 cup) ketchup"
- "125 ml (1/2 cup) apple cider vinegar"
- "125 ml (1/2 cup) peach preserves"
- "60 ml (1/4 cup) Dijon mustard"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) soy sauce"
instructions:
- "=== Pork Ribs Prep & Pressure Cooking ==="
- "Cut ribs into 3-4 bone sections for manageable steaming and better spice adhesion. Mix dry rub ingredients thoroughly, ensure even granules for consistent seasoning. Rub onto ribs liberally; coat both sides pressing in - not just dusting. The sugar caramelizes later; salt penetrates meat fibers; smoked paprika adds subtle hint of smoke without a smoker. Pour 180 ml (3/4 cup) water into pressure cooker base to create steam. Use steaming rack or trivet inside pot so ribs don’t sit in water, which causes sogginess."
- "Stack ribs standing vertical on the rack; saves space and ensures even heat exposure. Seal lid, set cooker to high pressure on meat or manual for about 45 minutes. Pressure cooks tough pork fast, but natural release at least 20 minutes mandatory. Quick release toughens meat, fibrous resistance remains. Natural release lets connective tissues relax, absorbing moisture. Open lid cautiously, watch steam hiss, ribs tender enough to pull apart easily without falling to mush."
- "Remove ribs from cooker, discard liquid. Let rest to firm slightly before grilling; cool ribs handle oiling and flipping better without falling."
- "=== Barbecue Sauce Simmer ==="
- "Melt butter in small saucepan; toast powders onion and garlic briefly ’til aromas bloom – 30-40 seconds max; burnt powders turn bitter. Add ketchup, vinegar, peach preserves instead of apple jelly for fruitier tang. Mustard and soy sauce give acid, spice, and umami depth; slightly saltier than Worcestershire, adjust salt later. Bring to low boil, then reduce heat to gentle bubble."
- "Simmer uncovered, stir occasionally, 12 to 18 minutes till sauce thickens and glazes spoon-back with some resistance. Under-thick sauce runs off ribs ruining caramelization; too thick hard to brush. Taste and adjust salt and pepper here, balance acidic-vinegar bite against sweet fruit."
- "=== Final Grill & Serve ==="
- "Preheat grill to medium heat; oil grates to prevent sticking – use tongs and paper towel dipped in oil (vegetable or canola oil preferred). Wait ’til hot so oil bonds to metal; prevent flare-ups by not dripping fat early."
- "Place ribs directly over heat; grill 15-18 minutes turning frequently for even char and caramelization. Brush ribs liberally with sauce every 4-5 minutes; builds sticky layers, helps crust develop. Watch fat sizzle and drip; flames licking underside indicate time to flip or move to cooler spot preventing charred bitterness."
- "Ribs done when meat near bones is reddish-pink but pulls away slightly, edges crisp but not burned. Should feel tender but hold shape; internal texture moist, not mushy. Rest a few minutes off grill; carries juices through meat fibers."
- "Serve ribs hot with reserved sauce for dipping or additional glazing just before eating. Garnish with chopped fresh herbs like cilantro or parsley if desired to cut richness."
- "Common issues and fixes: if ribs tough, likely quick release pressure too soon or insufficient rub. Drier sauce means simmer longer or thin with vinegar if overly thick. If grill sticks, clean better next session or raise temperature briefly to burn residue. Ribs falling apart on grill? Possibly overcooked in pressure cooker or handled too roughly when flipping."
- "Swap peach preserves back to apple jelly or add a tablespoon molasses for dark, rich tone. Soy sauce can be replaced with Worcestershire if available, but avoid doubling salty elements or sauce will overwhelm ribs."
introduction: "Dry rub crusted ribs. Pressure-steamed fast, retaining moisture while softening sinew. Timing tweaked to avoid rubber texture common with rushed releases. Sauce with peach preserves swaps tart apple jelly; soy sauce replaces Worcestershire—more savory, deeper flavor. Spices jiggled up with smoked paprika for subtle, smoky notes without smoking gear. Grilling finish seals juices—brush constantly. Ribs cut into smaller chunks for even cooking and easier handling. Watch skins bubble and char. Smells sweet, tangy, spicy. Quick but yields tender fish-hook ribs that pull from bone with firm bite. No fuss, just essentials. Kitchen tested methods shared."
ingredientsNote: "Sugar quantity reduced slightly to keep sauce from burning too fast on grill, critical for caramel color without bitterness. Chili powder increased for warmth and a bit more kick. Smoked paprika added—your shortcut to smoky flavor without smoker. Onion powder standard but garlic replaced with powder in sauce for better consistency and integration; fresh garlic burns easily in sauces like this. Peach preserves for seasonal twist, fruitier and less sticky than typical apple jelly. Soy sauce swaps Worcestershire to add earthy savoriness, easier pantry find in some households. Water quantity decreased to minimize steam dilution but enough for pressure cooking. If no pressure cooker, slow simmer ribs an hour in tightly covered pot then proceed to grill. Dry rub should be applied firmly so spices penetrate meat surface to flavor inner layers. Can substitute kosher salt with sea salt but measure carefully—fine salts pack differently."
instructionsNote: "Cut ribs in sections to ease flipping and even cooking—large racks don’t cook evenly in pressure cooker, especially at edges. Natural pressure release mandatory—rushing this step leaves tendons tense, ruining tender goals. Use steaming rack or raised trivet so ribs avoid water immersion; letting them boil results in mushy crust loss after grilling. Toast dry spices briefly in butter during sauce prep—aromas signal ready moment. Sauce needs slow simmer for reduction; watch bubbles—too vigorous and sugar burns, too slow extends time. Grill setup crucial: hot grill with oiled grates is the secret to crisp edges without sticking. Brush ribs with sauce several times while grilling to build sticky layers that caramelize under heat. Flip often to avoid burnt spots. Rest ribs a few minutes after grilling to allow juices to redistribute—cutting immediately drains flavor. Sauce can be made ahead and refrigerated, warming gently before use. Adjust sauce thickness with vinegar if it gels too firm after chilling."
tips:
- "Ribs cut into sections for even cooking and handling. Better spice adherence. Use a solid rub; don’t skimp. Let sit for 20 minutes if time allows."
- "Natural release matters. Quick release toughens meat. Let it sit. Ribs relax, juices redistribute, tenderness improves. Don’t rush this part for best results."
- "Oil the grill before it heats. Use paper towel, tongs, low smoke oil. No sticking; prevents flare-ups. Allow the grill to reach full temperature."
- "When simmering sauce, keep an eye on bubbles. If too vigorous, sugar burns. Stir occasionally. Light simmer is key; avoid overcooking or burning spices."
- "Flipping ribs often is crucial for even charring. Watch for flare-ups; adjust heat. Ribs need that reddish-pink but not mushy texture for best bite."
faq:
- "q: What if ribs turn tough? a: Quick release likely. Make sure to let it naturally release to relax fibers. Don't skimp on rub; it helps."
- "q: Sauce too thick? a: Simmer longer to thin out. Add a splash of vinegar if too firm after chilling. Balance flavors with careful adjustments."
- "q: Ribs falling apart on grill? a: Probably overcooked in pressure cooker. Handle gently while flipping. Less is more here. Keep it controlled."
- "q: Storage tips? a: Keep ribs refrigerated; cover well. Can freeze but separate layers with parchment. Sauce keeps too; can reheat gently."
