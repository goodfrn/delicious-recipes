ingredients:
- "3 medium zucchinis halved lengthwise and thinly sliced"
- "25 ml olive oil"
- "1 pizza dough recipe divided into four discs"
- "150 ml ricotta cheese at room temperature"
- "40 g finely grated pecorino romano cheese"
- "120 g smoked trout diced"
- "90 g peeled shrimp diced"
- "Fresh thyme and lemon zest to garnish"
- "Lemon wedges to serve"
- "Salt and cracked black pepper"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven at 220 C (425 F). Place heavy baking sheet upside down on lowest rack to heat thoroughly. The hot surface ensures crisp base."
- "Toss zucchini slices with olive oil; season with salt and pepper. This softens them quickly on the pizza without releasing excess water that sogs dough."
- "Divide dough into four equal parts. Flour surface to prevent sticking. Roll or press each piece into thin 20 cm discs. Thinner crust crisps better with rich toppings."
- "Spread ricotta evenly over one dough disc, leaving 1-2 cm border. Ricotta adds a creamy tang base with less fat than mascarpone; good substitute."
- "Sprinkle grated pecorino romano cheese evenly. This saltier, sharper cheese replaces parmigiano well."
- "Distribute zucchini, smoked trout and shrimp over the cheese layers. Smoky trout has more depth than fresh and works well with shrimp sweetness."
- "Season again lightly with salt and freshly cracked pepper. Under-seasoning dulls all flavors; taste your ricotta first to adjust salt."
- "Slide pizza (on parchment or peel) onto the preheated inverted baking sheet one at a time. Bake 12-14 minutes watching crust edges turn golden brown and cheese bubble gently. Don’t rely solely on timer; visual cues matter here."
- "Remove from oven carefully. Immediately sprinkle fresh thyme leaves and lemon zest over surface to brighten flavor and release herbal aroma. The heat will coax oils from thyme and fragrance lemon skin."
- "Serve with lemon wedges for squeezing. Acidity cuts richness."
- "Repeat for remaining pizzas."
introduction: "Starting off with zucchini, trout and shrimp on a white pizza. Different textures here. Zucchini thin and tender, trout smoky with meaty bites, shrimp sweet little pops. Cheese layer creamy but not heavy thanks to ricotta swap. Pecorino’s salt punches through. Oven screaming at 220 C with hot tray on bottom rack. Key to a crisp base is that intense, radiant heat. Watch for that golden edge, not just the timer. And herbs—cannot forget the herbs. Thyme releases that woody bright aroma that lifts the whole thing. Lemon zest too, zinging in freshness. If you can smell the oven and hear crackle of crust pulling away from metal sheet, you’re on the right track."
ingredientsNote: "Zucchini - go for medium-sized ones, avoid big fat water-logged monsters; slice thin so they cook swiftly without soggy dough issues. Ricotta in place of mascarpone trims fat but keeps richness; easy to find and less temperamental. Pecorino romano can be swapped back for parmigiano but expect sharper bite. Smoked trout adds complexity when fresh trout not available; it’s firmer, less moist so complements the dough better. Shrimp diced small to distribute evenly and cook quickly. Olive oil coats zucchini to soften but monitor quantity to avoid greasy base. Keep lemon and thyme fresh for impactful aroma; dried herbs won’t cut it here."
instructionsNote: "Heating the baking surface before assembling toppings is a game changer. Creates bottom heat that crisps dough before moisture from toppings turns it soggy. Tossing zucchini in oil and salt pre-emptively draws out some moisture and seasons uniformly. Rolling dough thinner ensures it cooks through in allocated time, avoiding doughy center. Spread ricotta in thin, even layer to prevent bubbling but still give creamy base. Watch the crust edges as main doneness signal. A golden hue with slight firming below means ready. Overcook and crust goes tough and dry. Under the oven rack keeps cheese top from burning while base crisps up. Fresh thyme and lemon zest sprinkled off heat release essential oils without wilting into brown bits. Lemon wedges add needed sharp acidity against creamy toppings. Timing judged by crust color and cheese bubbling not clocks; ovens vary too much otherwise. These variations keep pizza reliably consistent."
tips:
- "Want crispy dough? Preheat heavy baking sheet upside down. Creates hot surface to crisp base from below. Essential for success here. No soggy bottoms."
- "Zucchini slices need prep. Toss them in olive oil, salt. Helps draw moisture before baking. Season evenly; don't skip this. Moisture management vital."
- "Dough management matters too. Divide into four discs. Roll or press thin, about 20 cm. Thinner crust helps crisp perfectly. Watch edges turning golden."
- "Ricotta swaps are smart. Creamy without heavy fats like mascarpone. Spread thin layer. Prevents bubbling. Flavor intensity here is a must."
- "Cheese choice impacts everything. Pecorino’s sharpness vs. parmigiano’s softness. Choose based on desired flavor profile. Smoked trout is lively twist too."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid soggy pizza base? a: Preheat baking sheet. Monitor moisture from toppings, especially zucchini. Season your layers well; moisture control boosts crisp."
- "q: What about ingredient swaps? a: Use fresh herbs whenever possible. Olive oil for zucchini is crucial too. Pecorino and parmigiano can exchange roles; expect different flavors."
- "q: Key to doneness? a: Watch for golden crust edges, bubbling cheese. Visuals matter. Not just timers. Thick center? More time in oven. Adjust as needed."
- "q: Storage tips for leftovers? a: Store in fridge, airtight. Reheat hot oven. Microwaving leads to soggy crust. Be vigilant when reheating, crispiness is key."
