ingredients:
- "4 large skinless chicken thighs"
- "25 ml olive oil"
- "1 medium shallot, finely chopped"
- "3 cloves garlic, minced"
- "5 ml ground turmeric"
- "2 ml ground cinnamon"
- "1 thumb-size piece ginger, grated"
- "180 ml chicken stock"
- "1 large celery stalk cut into 4 cm lengths"
- "Zest of 1 lemon"
- "Salt and freshly cracked black pepper"
instructions:
- "Set pressure cooker to sauté mode, heat oil until shimmering. Brown half the chicken thighs at once, 3 minutes per side until golden but not cooked through. Salt and pepper now; store on plate. Repeat with remaining thighs."
- "Lower heat, add shallot to rendered fat, gently cook until translucent and just starting to color, about 4 minutes. Add garlic, turmeric, cinnamon, ginger; stir constantly 1-2 minutes until fragrant but not burnt. Smell should shift aromatic-citrusy-spiced."
- "Pour in chicken stock, scrape browned bits with wooden spoon. Return all chicken pieces to pot, nestle celery chunks around them. Sprinkle lemon zest over everything. Season again carefully. No liquid covering chicken fully — partially submerged to keep skin from soggy texture."
- "Lock lid, set pressure setting to poultry or 12 minutes if manual. Natural release for 15 minutes. If the cooker has no natural release, vent carefully after 12 minutes to avoid steam burns."
- "Remove lid, chicken should be tender but still holding shape. Celery remains slightly firm but not raw—bright green, with snap when pierced. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Optional splash of olive oil or squeeze fresh lemon juice to finish."
- "Serve with long-grain white rice or millet. Sauce may appear thin; swirl in cold butter substitute (vegan margarine) off heat to thicken slightly, if preferred."
introduction: "Skip drying chicken. Skinless thighs cook evenly under pressure without rubbery skin getting in the way. Hands-on browning builds flavor base—you want those caramelized bits stuck to the pot; this is gold for your sauce. Celery isn't just filler. Cut too small it turns to mush; too big, it never softens. 4 cm chunks hit the sweet spot. Aromatics layered: turmeric for earthiness, cinnamon for warmth, ginger for zing. Swapping safran with cinnamon here, safer pantry move. Lime zest swapped for lemon zest adds brightness but less acidity, letting spices shine. Watch the liquid level—chicken partially bathed, not swimming. Texture depends on that. Pressure cook times vary by cooker model; learn your gear's signs. Natural pressure release lets meat rest and keeps juices locked in. You'll hear that shift in pressure, watch the hiss—the pressure cooker talks if you listen."
ingredientsNote: "Skinless thighs preferred because skin tends to get flabby or tough under pressure. Use dark meat for moisture retention. Shallots mellower than onions, more elegant base aroma. Garlic gets the briefest cook to avoid bitterness. Turmeric powder fresh gives earthy color; if you only have ground ginger, decrease quantity to avoid overwhelming. Celery stalks must be firm and fresh; limp celery becomes stringy. Swap celery with fennel stalks if you want an anise twist. Instead of chicken stock, vegetable broth or even water with bouillon cube is fine—but flavor dims slightly. Lemon zest over juice here to keep dish balanced without watering down. Olive oil for sauté works, no necessity to use butter substitutes if not allergic. Salt late and taste often; pressure cooks concentrate seasoning."
instructionsNote: "Browning chicken pieces in batches prevents steaming, locks moisture in. You want golden crust, not pale. Use moderate heat—too hot and oil smokes, too low it just stews. Remove chicken before adding aromatics to avoid burning garlic or spices. Stir aromatics constantly once added; their window before turning bitter is short. Deglazing scrapes those flavorful browned bits; essential. When returning chicken and celery, nestle everything, don’t overcrowd. Liquid level at about halfway submerges chicken to prevent sogginess. Set pressure mode specifically for poultry or use manual timing at about 12 minutes; go higher only if pieces are unusually large. After cooking, natural pressure release is key. Quick release can make meat tough due to abrupt temperature change. Celery remains slightly crisp which provides texture contrast; overcooked celery is mushy and unappealing. Finish with fresh acidity suits the earthy spices, balancing heaviness. If sauce appears runny, swirl in cold vegan margarine or cornstarch slurry off heat to thicken but avoid boiling once thickener is added."
tips:
- "Start with skinless thighs. Less flabby texture under pressure. Brown in batches; oil should shimmer but not smoke. 3 minutes each side. Lock in flavor."
- "Add shallots before garlic. Gently cook them in rendered fat, about 4 minutes. Avoid bitter garlic by timing. Once fragrant, it's time for spices."
- "Scrape those browned bits. They’re packed with flavor—must deglaze. Chicken partway submerged, texture matters. Don't drown it. Bright flavors need balance."
- "Watch the cooker—12 minutes on poultry setting is key. Limit steam burns with careful venting. Natural release keeps moisture intact. Visual cues matter."
- "If the sauce is thin, swirl in cold vegan margarine off heat; it thickens slightly. Overcooked celery? No good. Aim for firmness with snap, bright green."
faq:
- "q: How to keep chicken moist? a: Brown well first. Follow timing; watch pressure settings. Too long equals dryness. Adjust liquids accordingly."
- "q: What alternatives for celery? a: Try green beans instead. Or zucchini in last 5 minutes. Timed right, they add nice crunch and flavor."
- "q: What if browning doesn’t happen? a: Lower temp and reshape batches. Overcrowded pot leads to steaming. Keep space for searing; it matters."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Airtight container is best. Fridge up to 3 days; freeze for longer. Reheat gently. Quick reheating = drying out."
