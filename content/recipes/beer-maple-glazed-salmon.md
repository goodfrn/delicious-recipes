ingredients:
- "=== Glaze ==="
- "90 ml (6 tbsp) stout beer"
- "80 ml (5 tbsp plus 1 tsp) maple syrup"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) tamari soy sauce"
- "4 ml (3/4 tsp) whole grain mustard"
- "=== Salmon ==="
- "550 g (1 1/4 lb) salmon fillet skin removed, cut into 4 pieces"
- "Salt and black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "=== Glaze Preparation ==="
- "1. Combine stout, maple syrup, tamari, and grainy mustard in a small pot."
- "2. Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat, stir often to mix mustard seeds and dissolve ingredients."
- "3. Reduce heat and let simmer about 12 minutes or until thick and syrupy, almost jam-like consistency."
- "4. Remove from heat, cool for 15 minutes then refrigerate until cold and slightly firmer."
- "=== Salmon Cooking ==="
- "5. Position oven rack in the upper third and preheat broiler to high."
- "6. Lightly oil a shallow baking dish or rimmed pan."
- "7. Place salmon pieces in dish, season with salt and black pepper."
- "8. Brush a thick layer of chilled glaze onto each piece, saving some glaze for serving."
- "9. Broil salmon 7 to 9 minutes depending on thickness until edges start to caramelize and flesh flakes easily."
- "10. Optional: Give one last glaze brush right before serving for shine and flavor boost."
- "11. Serve hot with barley pilaf and roasted root vegetables or other simple grains and veg."
introduction: "Glaze sticky, not too thick. Sharp hit of grainy mustard seeds. Beer adds bitterness that cuts the maple. Layers of flavors — sweet, umami, tangy, smoky. Salmon flaky, juicy inside. Broiling quick, no fuss. The sauce reduces to a syrup you want to slather, not drown. Dark stout and tamari play well together, richer than soy and pale ale originally in mind. Salmon comes out glossy, crackling on top. Good with any roasted root veg — carrots, parsnips. Barley pilaf fills the plate, chewy contrast. No dairy, nuts, eggs here. Clean, straightforward. No fancy gadgets. Time to get sticky fingers."
ingredientsNote: "Switched stout for dark beer, lends malt caramel notes plus smoke over regular black beer. Tamari instead of soy sauce—deeper, less salty, more umami. Grainy mustard for texture and bursts from mustard seeds, replacing smooth Dijon. Reduced liquid quantities to avoid runny glaze. Salmon quantity cut slightly to maintain balance with thicker glaze. Keep sauce cold until brushing so it coats well and doesn’t drip. Use skinless filets, uniform size for even cooking. Salt and pepper season simply, nothing else needed. Good quality maple syrup preferred, medium amber for balance between sweetness and earthiness. No added oils in glaze, just natural ingredients. Convenient, creates a versatile glaze usable for other proteins too."
instructionsNote: "Heat and stir glaze ingredients, watch carefully to avoid burning. Simmer until thick—thickness cues: slow drip from spoon, syrupy but pourable at room temp. Cool fully then chill, the glaze firms and thickens for better coating. Broiler placement crucial — too close, burns glaze; too far, no caramelization. Oiled baking dish prevents sticking, supports even cook. Brush glaze generously before broiling and optionally after — glossy finish, concentrated flavor. Cooking time shifts ±1-2 minutes depending on filet thickness. Salmon is done when it flakes easily but still moist inside, bright pink. Let rest briefly before serving so glaze sets, flavors meld. Barley pilaf cooked separately, paired with slow-roasted root veg to keep plate rustic. Don’t overbrush glaze during cook, might drip or burn."
tips:
- "Chill glaze well after cooking. Thickens more. Ideal for coating. Cold glaze sticks better. Saves mess. Brush it on generously. Check thickness before broiling. Should string from spoon but not drip."
- "Broiler heat varies. Position an oven rack properly. Too close, burns edges. Too far, no crisp top. Salmon pieces should be similar size. For even cooking, ensure uniform thickness. 1 inch ideal generally."
- "Use good quality maple syrup. Medium amber gives balance. Earthy, not overly sweet. Grainy mustard brings texture. The seeds burst. Cuts sweetness from syrup with tangy punch. Measure accurately for best results."
- "Oiled dish prevents sticking. Less cleanup. Use rimmed pan to avoid glaze drips. Essential for catching juices. Don’t overcrowd salmon pieces. Each needs space. Let heat circulate for even broiling."
- "Keep an eye while broiling. Salmon cooks fast. Flakes easily but should stay moist. Cook times can shift depending on thickness. Monitor closely for best results. Use fork to check doneness. Rest before serving."
faq:
- "q: How to get glaze right? a: Cook till thick, syrupy. Watch carefully. Avoid burning. It needs cool down time. Helps firm. Brush it cold. Easy application. Don’t rush this step."
- "q: What if salmon is dry? a: Common mistake. Overcooking. Use a timer. Broil just till flakes appear. Salmon holds moisture well. Rest after cooking. Let flavors meld before you serve."
- "q: Can I use other fish? a: Yes, choices matter. Try trout or cod. Cooking times vary. Flaky, tender. Adjust glaze quantity as needed. Fish type could change texture too."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep in airtight container. Refrigerate for up to two days. Reheat gentle. Use oven or microwave. Avoid drying out. Cover with moisture for better results."
