description: "Take a classic blondie bar, twist the candy mix for new textures and flavors. Butter and sugars whipped until just right, not a second wasted. Folded in are semi-sweet chocolate chunks swapped instead of chips for better melt, and chopped toasted pecans replace sprinkles, adding crunch. M&Ms remain but reduced quantity so no candy overload. Few extra minutes baking until golden brown all around, center still moist but firm to touch. Lift from pan by parchment, cut before fully cold for cleaner squares. Easy swap ingredients keep pantry-friendly but exciting results every batch."
metaDescription: "Holiday Candy Blondie Bars combine rich butter, brown sugar, and candy for a festive treat that’s chewy and satisfying."

ingredients:
- "1 cup unsalted butter melted plus extra for pan"
- "1 cup light brown sugar packed"
- "1/2 cup granulated sugar"
- "1 large egg at room temperature"
- "1 ½ teaspoons pure vanilla extract"
- "1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour sifted"
- "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chunks"
- "1/4 cup mini M&M’s chopped"
- "1/3 cup chopped toasted pecans"
instructions:
- "Heat oven to 345°F. Butter an 8×8-inch square pan, line with parchment leaving overhang on two sides for easy lifting."
- "In a large bowl whisk together melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar just until combined, not granular. Whisk in egg and vanilla, beating until glossy and slightly thickened. Avoid overmixing or you'll toughen the batter."
- "Sift flour and salt directly over wet mixture. Fold in gently with spatula until no dry streaks but batter still lumpy. Over-folding develops gluten and dries final texture."
- "Stir in chocolate chunks, chopped M&M’s, and toasted pecans carefully. The nuts add crunch and nutty warmth, balancing sweetness."
- "Spread batter evenly in pan. Smooth top with offset spatula, don’t press down or risk compacting crumb. Scatter a few extra M&M pieces on top for visual pop."
- "Bake 23–27 minutes. Look for edges turning golden and center set but still tender to the touch—not liquidy or overly firm. Toothpick inserted should have a few moist crumbs, not wet batter."
- "Remove from oven. Set pan on a rack to cool for at least 30 mins until warm but no longer piping hot—makes cutting cleaner."
- "Lift bars out using parchment. Cut into 9 squares right away for sharper lines or after full cooling for fudgier bites."
- "Store airtight. Shelf life shrinks if nuts go stale, so for longer keep in fridge sealed to preserve crunch."
introduction: "Bars with candy bits scattered in batter. Butter and sugar whipped forming base that anchors dense but tender crumb. Egg and vanilla pull flavor together, flour added gently - too much mixing, tough bars. Chocolate chunks melt differently than chips; preference, but chunks give pockets of gooey richness. Nuts add texture variance—a must in candy bars to avoid samey chew. M&M’s tossed in controlled quantities so sweetness doesn’t drown the layers beneath. Parchment with overhang, your best friend for lifting correct. Visual cues trump timers—edges golden, center set but soft. Trial and error in kitchen fine tunes baking time, trust your eye."
ingredientsNote: "Butter melted for easy incorporation and moist crumb. Swap semi-sweet chunks for chips to avoid clumping and promote melty pits. Toast nuts dry at low heat until fragrant, 5–7 mins will do, bring out oils without overcooking. M&M quantity adjusted down to 1/4 cup chopped, less candy bulk means balance between texture and sugar. Vanilla important for depth, imitation vanilla won’t yield same notes. Flour sifted catches any lumps, lighter batter. Salt counters all sweetness; don’t omit. Using parchment with overhang makes removal clean and fast without damaging edges—essential for neat squares. Refrigerate leftover bars to preserve toasted nut crunch."
instructionsNote: "Butter and sugar should be whisked until they lose granularity but not airy. Egg whisked in to emulsify fats and sugars smoothly, prevents greasy pockets. Mix flour in with a folding motion, think gentle waves not whipping action, avoids tough bars. Adding chocolate and nuts last prevents overmixing. Spreading batter evenly ensures even cooking; thick spots will hold moisture and spoil edges. Watch for visual and tactile signs rather than relying solely on minutes. Oven temps vary, so the golden edges and clean toothpick test matter more. Cool bars on wire rack so steam escapes; trapping moisture ruins texture. Cut warmish for clean edges, cool completely for chewy texture. Store in cool place, nuts prone to rancidity if left too long at room temp."
tips:
- "Whisk butter and sugars until granular disappears. Mix slowly and well. Avoid air, or bars get dry. Eggs should blend smoothly for tenderness. Use room temp for easier mixing."
- "Sifting flour catches lumps. Helps create lighter texture. Fold carefully—no overmixing to avoid tough bars. Visual cues matter: edges golden, center soft but not wet. Check with toothpick."
- "Use good quality chocolate chunks; they melt better than chips. Adds gooey richness. Chopped nuts should be toasted for depth. 5-7 mins in low heat enhances flavor without burning."
- "Store bars airtight to keep them fresh. Nuts can go stale quickly. Refrigerate leftovers to maintain crunch. Room temp not good long-term; they need cool storage."
- "Try swapping pecans for walnuts if desired. Both work well. Adjust the sweetness in M&M’s—go for less if worried about overload. Balance is key in candy desserts."
faq:
- "q: How to tell when bars are done? a: Look for golden edges. Center should be set but soft to touch. Insert toothpick. Few moist crumbs is right."
- "q: Can I add more M&M's? a: Yes but adjust overall sweetness. Too much can drown out other flavors. Consider textures—more candy means less balance."
- "q: What if they stick to the pan? a: Use plenty of butter. Parchment paper helps remove them cleanly. Let them cool—steam can cause sticking."
- "q: How long do these bars last? a: About a week at room temp. Fridge extends life but changes texture. Store in airtight container, keep moisture out."
