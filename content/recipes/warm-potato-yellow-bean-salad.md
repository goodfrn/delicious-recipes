ingredients:
- "1.4 kg (3 lb) yellow-fleshed potatoes cut into eighths"
- "60 ml (4 tablespoons) olive oil divided"
- "200 g (7 oz) trimmed yellow beans"
- "2 stalks celery finely sliced with leaves"
- "80 ml (1/3 cup) mayonnaise"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tablespoons) grainy Dijon mustard"
- "15 ml (1 tablespoon) apple cider vinegar"
- "15 ml (1 tablespoon) honey"
instructions:
- "=== Salad ==="
- "1. Heat barbecue to high heat."
- "2. Lay two large sheets of aluminum foil overlapped. Place potatoes in center. Drizzle with 40 ml (2 1/2 tablespoons) olive oil. Salt and pepper liberally. Seal tightly into a packet."
- "3. Place packet on grill. Close lid. Cook 15 minutes."
- "4. Prepare another foil packet layered similarly. Put beans inside. Drizzle with remaining 20 ml (1 1/2 tablespoons) olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Seal well."
- "5. Arrange bean packet next to potatoes on grill. Flip potato packet once halfway through cooking. Close lid. Grill beans and potatoes together 10 more minutes, until tender."
- "=== Dressing ==="
- "6. In a large bowl whisk mayonnaise, Dijon, vinegar, honey until combined."
- "7. Remove packets from grill carefully. Transfer potatoes, beans, and celery into bowl with dressing."
- "8. Gently fold all together to coat. Adjust seasoning if needed. Serve warm or at room temperature."
introduction: "Potatoes chunked and grilled. Beans yellow and tender. Celery crisp and bright. A rough-hewn salad, warm and rustic. Dressing creamy with tang and sweetness, honey swapping maple, grainy Dijon sharp and textured instead of whole grain mustard. Foil packets on the barbecue. Steam, smoke, all in one. Flip the potatoes; the beans just need a bit less time, tender but still with snap. No fuss. Mix it all in the bowl, fold gently to not break the soft potatoes. Serve with grilled tomahawk or tofu if you want protein. No gluten, no nuts, no dairy. Just pure vegetable warmth and tang."
ingredientsNote: "Increase potatoes slightly to 1.4 kg for more servings or hearty portions. Use yellow-fleshed potatoes for balanced starch and buttery texture. Yellow beans can be replaced with green beans for color but lose the mild sweetness. Celery adds crunch and fresh aroma; leaves can be included or omitted depending on preference. For dressing, swap maple syrup to honey for a floral note, and use grainy Dijon instead of whole grain mustard, creating a sharper spread and more textured dressing. Olive oil split between potatoes and beans coats evenly and aids steaming under foil, trapping smoky heat from grill. Salt and pepper generously to build flavor in simple ingredients."
instructionsNote: "Start potatoes first since they take longer, sealing in foil traps moisture. Fifteen minutes initially at high heat ensures cooking begins deeply, flip to cook both sides evenly. Beans cook slightly less time—ten minutes total with potatoes—remain just tender and bright yellow. Keep foil packets sealed snugly for steam and smoke infusion. Use separate packets to allow even seasoning and cooking control. Dressing whisked while grill works frees hands, blending creamy mayo, sharp vinegar, mustard, and honey for balanced sweet-tart notes. Tossing warm vegetables with dressing lets flavors mingle, potatoes absorb some dressing, celery stays crisp. Best served warm or room temp, not cold, texture and flavor more vibrant. Adjust salt and pepper after mixing, as dressing and cooking soften bites."
tips:
- "Precook potatoes till tender, then grill them. It speeds up the process. Reduce grilling time for the beans. Keep an eye on them. They cook fast. Flavor builds with salt and pepper—don’t skip that part."
- "Cut potatoes evenly. Ensures they grill at the same rate. If pieces vary in size, some get mushy. Use good quality olive oil. Strong flavor enhances both potato and beans. Don't go cheap; it matters."
- "Make the dressing first. It saves time and it blends flavors. Use a whisk for a smooth mix—don’t rush. Adjust honey; balance the tang from vinegar. More sweetness next time? Save this info for later."
- "Serve warm. Not cold. Warmth enhances flavors in this salad. It brings out the sweetness of potatoes and beans. So, bring it to room temp if made earlier. Texture changes if cold."
- "Leftovers? Store in the fridge. But reheating alters textures. Use low heat to preserve flavor. Beans can go mushy easily. Consider adding fresh herbs before serving. Brightens up old salads."
faq:
- "q: How to ensure even cooking? a: Start with potatoes first those need longer. Then add beans. Keep everything sealed during grilling. Flip packets halfway steals flavor."
- "q: What to substitute for beans? a: Green beans work but change taste. Use broccoli for crunch. Carrots offer sweetness too. But cut them smaller, fast cooking."
- "q: Can I use different dressings? a: Absolutely. Swap mayo with yogurt for lighter feel. Mustard too, different types change flavor profile. Experiment till it feels right."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Store in airtight container. Keeps for a couple of days. Reheat gently to keep textures. Use in wraps or grain bowls later for a twist."
