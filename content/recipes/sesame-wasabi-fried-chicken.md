instructions:
- "=== Wasabi Mayo ==="
- "1. Combine mayonnaise, lemon juice, mirin, and wasabi in a bowl. Stir well and refrigerate while preparing chicken."
- "=== Chicken Prep ==="
- "2. Heat canola oil in fryer or deep pan to 175°C (350°F). Line a tray with paper towels or use a wire rack."
- "3. Mix soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame seeds, toasted sesame oil, wasabi, and crushed black pepper in a large bowl."
- "4. Add flour, tapioca starch, and water to the wet mix. Stir to combine, avoid clumps. Rest about 15 minutes for flavors to meld and batter to thicken slightly."
- "5. Add chicken pieces to batter. Toss until every piece is coated evenly."
- "6. Fry chicken in batches, 4-5 pieces at a time, about 5-6 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through. Be cautious with hot oil splashes."
- "7. Drain on prepared tray and keep warm. Repeat until all chicken is done."
- "8. Serve hot with wasabi mayonnaise on the side."
introduction: "Chunky chicken bits. Crispy shell with a kick. Sesame seeds give nuttiness. Wasabi adds sharp heat. Mayo dips, sharp and tangy, hits balance. Quick batter with tapioca starch, flour, water mix. Mirin and rice vinegar bring brightness. Frying needs attention. Hot oil splattering, careful with batches. Warm, fresh from fryer best. Asian-inspired snack or main. No nuts to worry about. No dairy either. Just punch and crunch."
ingredientsNote: "Adjust wasabi level to taste; powder or paste both fine but measure carefully. Tapioca starch adds crispness, can swap with potato starch if needed but alters texture slightly. Mirin adds sweetness and depth; substitute with dry sherry or a mix of sugar and rice vinegar if unavailable. Sesame oil and seeds introduce a smoky aroma—don't skip. Use unbleached flour for batter’s best texture. Chicken breasts are lean; don’t overcook or dry out. Let batter rest so starches hydrate and thicken, coating better."
instructionsNote: "Temperature control crucial. Preheat oil fully before frying, 175°C is spot on, too cool means greasy chicken. Batter should cling thickly but flow slightly; thin batter leads to thin crust. Resting batter helps. Fry few pieces at once to maintain oil temperature. Drain well on rack or paper towels. Keep cooked chicken warm in low oven if making big batch. The mayo comes first to set flavor tone; refrigerate to meld. Serve chicken hot with mayo alongside for dipping. Wasabi mayo also usable as spread for sandwiches or burgers."
tips:
- "Use a thermometer. Maintain oil at 175°C for crispiness. Too low the chicken soaks oil. Too high burns. Batch frying isolates temp drops."
- "Batter should be thick yet flow. Cling to chicken pieces. Rest the batter. Hydrate starches. Avoid lumps but don’t overmix."
- "Adjust wasabi level. Start small; you can always add. Powder or paste work for mayo. Experiment till you find the heat you love."
- "Drain chicken well once fried. Paper towels help soak up excess oil. Kick up warmth if making a big batch in advance with low oven."
- "Tools matter; use a wire rack for draining. Keeps chicken crisp. Avoid sogginess from resting in oil. Safety with hot oil is key."
faq:
- "q: Can I use chicken thighs instead? a: Yes you can. Thighs have more fat. They stay juicier. Adjust frying time. Keep an eye on temperature."
- "q: How long does this stay fresh? a: Store in fridge. Last about 2 days. Reheat in oven if you want crisp. No microwave to avoid sogginess."
- "q: Can I make it gluten-free? a: Sure! Use gluten-free flour. Tapioca starch works well too. Check soy sauce if concerned about gluten."
- "q: What if I have no mirin? a: Substitute with sugar and rice vinegar mix. Or use dry sherry. Not exact but gives a sweet touch."
