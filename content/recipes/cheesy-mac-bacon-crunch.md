- "1 garlic clove, minced"
- "1 shallot, minced"
- "1 cup baguette croutons, crushed"
- "1/3 cup fresh thyme leaves, chopped"
- "=== Pasta ==="
- "300 g elbow macaroni"
- "1 tbsp corn starch"
- "750 ml evaporated milk"
- "1/2 tsp smoked paprika"
- "1/4 tsp dry mustard powder"
- "1/2 tsp garlic powder"
- "3 tbsp unsalted butter"
- "2 tbsp all-purpose flour"
- "1 1/2 cups sharp white cheddar cheese, shredded"
- "1/4 tsp cayenne pepper"
instructions:
- "=== Bacon Crumble ==="
- "Fry bacon on medium-high until crispy. Drain fat into bowl, reserve both separately."
- "In same pan, add garlic, shallot, croutons. Use bacon fat as needed. Stir 3 mins till croutons color. Remove from heat. Toss in bacon and thyme. Keep warm."
- "=== Pasta ==="
- "Boil salted water. Cook macaroni till al dente, about 8-9 minutes. Reserve 1 cup pasta water. Drain."
- "Whisk corn starch into 1/4 cup milk. Stir in paprika, mustard, garlic powder."
- "Melt butter in saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour, cook 1-2 mins whisking to form roux."
- "Gradually whisk in milk mixture, then remaining milk. Bring to gentle boil whisking constantly. Simmer 2 mins till thickened. Remove from heat."
- "Stir in cheddar till melted. Season with salt and pepper, add cayenne to taste."
- "Mix macaroni with sauce. Return to low heat briefly if needed. Adjust thickness with pasta water."
- "Serve pasta in bowls. Sprinkle bacon crumble on top immediately."
introduction: "Cheese sauce sharp, with white cheddar and smoky paprika. Heat from cayenne not overwhelming but noticeable. Cornstarch thickens gently. Bacon crisp, garlic and shallot mingle with croutons, thyme adds herbal pop. Macaroni cooked till soft but firm inside. Sauce coats every bite, creamy thick. Slice of lemon wedge optional. No nuts or eggs. Simple base for layering flavor."
ingredientsNote: "Bacon quantity trimmed to reduce greasiness but keep crunch. Thyme swaps parsley for earthiness. Cayenne replaces Tabasco for dry heat style. White cheddar stands in for orange for sharper bite. Evaporated milk ensures richness with less water. Flour and cornstarch combo for smooth but stable sauce. Croutons must be crunchy to hold crumble texture. Shallot instead of French echalote for subtle difference. All ingredients readily found."
instructionsNote: "Crisp bacon first, hold fat for toasting crumbs, locking flavor. Toast croutons just till golden adds texture, careful not to burn. Pasta timing crucial—overcooked turns mushy, undercooked gummy. Roux cooked 1-2 mins to avoid raw flour taste. Whisk milk gradually to avoid lumps. Melting cheese off heat prevents grainy sauce. Reheat gently to combine. Use pasta water to loosen sauce thoughtfully. Serve immediately or crumble soggy."
tips:
- "Start with crisping the bacon. Cook on medium-high. Drain fat in a bowl. Reserve both. This step builds flavor."
- "When toasting croutons—keep an eye on them. Just until golden. Don’t burn. Brown edges add crunch. Use bacon fat."
- "Timing on pasta crucial. Too soft ruins texture. Al dente is the goal—about 8-9 minutes usually works. Drain, but reserve pasta water."
- "Whisk milk gradually when making sauce. Avoid lumps. Cornstarch in milk before combining helps thicken smoothly. Don’t rush."
- "Mix cheddar into sauce off heat. Melts better, smoother sauce. Adjust thickness with reserved pasta water if too thick. Serve immediately."
faq:
- "q: How long to cook pasta? a: About 8-9 minutes for al dente. Timing matters a lot. Too long mushy. Timing crucial."
- "q: Can I use a different cheese? a: Yes. Gouda or mozzarella could work. Adds different flavors. Sharpness may differ. Adjust spices."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. Lasts 3-4 days. Reheat low and slow. Might dry out. Add some milk."
- "q: What's the best way to reheat? a: Oven or stovetop preferred. Heat gently. Sauce may thicken. Add moisture if needed."
