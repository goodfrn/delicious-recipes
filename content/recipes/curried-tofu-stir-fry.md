ingredients:
- "315 g firm tofu cut into cubes"
- "45 ml olive oil"
- "1 medium onion thinly sliced"
- "3 garlic cloves minced"
- "400 g mixed fresh or frozen veggies (carrot slices, broccoli florets, cauliflower florets)"
- "12 ml curry powder"
- "1 can 150 ml coconut cream"
- "2 green onions, thinly sliced"
- "1 lime, finely grated zest"
- "20 ml fresh lime juice"
- "4 ml sugar"
- "5 ml harissa paste"
instructions:
- "Heat half the olive oil (22 ml) in large nonstick skillet over medium-high."
- "Brown tofu cubes on all sides, about 4-5 mins total, until golden and crisp. Remove and set aside on plate."
- "Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan heat remaining oil (23 ml). Add sliced onion and garlic. Cook 4 minutes stirring occasionally until softened but not browned."
- "Add mixed vegetables to saucepan and cook 6 minutes stirring frequently to keep veggies slightly firm."
- "Return tofu to vegetables. Sprinkle curry powder over mixture. Stir and cook 2 minutes to bloom spices."
- "Pour coconut cream into pan. Add lime zest, lime juice, sugar, and harissa. Stir to combine evenly."
- "Simmer gently 5 minutes uncovered, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens slightly and vegetables are just tender but still crunchy."
- "Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste."
- "Sprinkle green onions over top before serving."
- "Dish into bowls and optionally serve with plain steamed white rice."
introduction: "Firm tofu transformed into crunchy cubes. Bright veggies sliced and simmered slightly. Curry spice powder coats everything. Tropical notes from coconut cream soften heat. Lime zest and juice slice through richness. Harissa paste amps spicy volume. Garlic and onion soften base flavors. Quick sear on tofu builds texture contrast. Vegetables stay crisp to add bite. All vegan and allergen-friendly, no gluten or dairy. Balanced, colorful, easy. The kind of meal you throw together after work, without fuss. Spices meld gently with coconut, heat lingers just right. Rice optional but recommended. Leftovers reheat good. No long waits, no weird ingredients."
ingredientsNote: "Scale tofu down slightly to accommodate olive oil’s lower smoke point compared to canola, preventing burning. Harissa replaces sambal oelek for a deeper smoky heat. Coconut cream makes sauce thicker and richer than coconut milk. Lime juice reduced a bit to balance sourness with sweetness. Use a colorful mix of vegetables for texture contrast—carrots keep sweet snap, broccoli adds slight bitterness, cauliflower softens slightly but holds shape. Onion and garlic finely minced to meld into sauce without overpowering crisp veggies. Fresh green onions added after cooking for brightness and a slight crunch. Sugar rounds out spicy and sour notes, balancing flavor harmonies."
instructionsNote: "Brown tofu in half the oil until crisp and golden; avoid overcrowding pan for even sear. Transfer tofu out to keep texture. Sauté onion and garlic gently in remaining oil to release aromas without coloring too much. Add veggies next for a gentle cook maintaining al dente quality; avoid overcooking. Curry powder added after tofu returns to skillet to toast slightly and deepen flavors; stir constantly to prevent scorching spices. Pour coconut cream and add lime zest and juice last to preserve fresh citrus taste; simmer uncovered to thicken sauce and intensify flavor melding. Harissa stirred in provides smoky heat contrasting with citrus zing. Salt and pepper season at end so salts don’t dry veggies during cooking. Garnish with green onions freshly sliced to finish. Serve immediately or hold briefly on very low heat."
tips:
- "Use firm tofu. More texture, holds up. Squeeze excess water before cooking. Helps crisp better while frying."
- "No overcrowding in skillet. This ensures even browning. Work in batches if necessary. Crispiness is key."
- "Vegetables should remain al dente. Overcooked veggies lose crunch. Stir frequently to keep them firm and vibrant."
- "Sauce thickens during simmering. Stir often, prevent sticking. Cook uncovered to let moisture escape. Adjust moisture based on preference."
- "Adjust lime juice for tartness. Add more if needed. Tastes best when balanced. Sweet and sour harmony is ideal."
faq:
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Keep in airtight container. Refrigerate for 3 days. Reheat gently on stove."
- "q: Can I use different veggies? a: Yes, mix and match. Bell peppers, snap peas work well. Frozen veggies are fine too."
- "q: Why is my tofu not crispy? a: Excess moisture causes sogginess. Press tofu before cooking. Avoid overcrowding pan."
- "q: Can I substitute coconut cream? a: Use coconut milk if desired. Note that sauce will be thinner. Adjust cooking time as needed."
