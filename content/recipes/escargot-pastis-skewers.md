- "2 garlic cloves minced"
- "2 cans escargots 100 g each rinsed drained"
- "30 ml olive oil"
- "60 ml absinthe"
- "125 ml dry white wine"
- "25 ml mayonnaise"
- "15 ml finely chopped fresh tarragon"
- "1/2 tsp fennel pollen"
instructions:
- "Heat oil in pan. Add shallot garlic. Cook 3 minutes until soft."
- "Add escargots. Season with salt pepper. Stir 2 more minutes."
- "Pour absinthe and white wine. Let reduce almost dry about 6 minutes."
- "Remove from heat. Transfer to bowl. Cool down 10 minutes."
- "Mix mayonnaise tarragon fennel pollen into cooled escargot mix. Adjust salt pepper."
- "Soak wooden skewers 30 minutes in water while prepping."
- "Preheat grill high. Oil grates lightly."
- "Thread escargots carefully onto skewers. Small groups per skewer."
- "Grill 2-3 minutes per side until just charred. Watch close."
- "Serve warm right off grill. Appetizer style."
introduction: "No fuss. Snails meet booze. Absinthe replaces pastis here, sharper but aromatic. Shallots and garlic soften the game. No cream, no gluten, no frills. A sprinkle of fennel pollen sneaks in an extra layer. Quick sear on hot grates, just enough char. Skewers bring a pop of rustic French vibe. Bite-size little things, easy on hands, casual nibbling at the start. Traditional, reworked with a slight herb twist. Cool then warm, texture and flavor contrast. A starter with personality."
ingredientsNote: "Escargots need a rinse to take off any briny residue. Shallots and garlic finely chopped to avoid overpowering chunks. Switched butter for olive oil to cut richness and add a grassy note. Absinthe swaps pastis, lending a sharper, aniseed flavor but less sweetness. Fennel pollen is subtle - optional but recommended for complexity. Mayonnaise binds but keep it light, just enough creaminess. Fresh tarragon chopped and folded at end, don't cook or lose aroma. Wooden skewers soak 30 minutes max to avoid burning on grill."
instructionsNote: "Cook shallots garlic low and slow at start to soften but avoid brown bits. Adding escargots early infuses flavor. Deglazing with absinthe and wine reduces liquid to concentrate aroma, watch closely not to burn. Cool mixture properly before mayo to prevent breaking. Threading escargots in tight little groups gives better bite and stability on grill. Grill on clean, oiled grates to avoid sticking. Turn briskly after 2 minutes for even char. Don't overcook escargots or they get rubbery. Serve immediately off heat, no garnish needed but lemon wedge optional."
tips:
- "Use fresh shelled escargots. Drain before cooking. Rinse them well. This helps remove any brine taste. Should be tender. Check quality."
- "Soak wooden skewers in water for 30 minutes. This prevents burning on the grill. Essential step. Keeps the skewers intact while cooking."
- "Use a fine dice for shallots and garlic. This way, they won't overpower each bite. Flavor balance is key. Don't let them brown."
- "Keep an eye on the grill heat. High is good, but avoid flare-ups. Turn the skewers frequently for even char. Two to three minutes per side."
- "Chill the escargot mixture before adding mayo. This avoids breaking. Light mix keeps it airy. Balance flavor without heavy cream."
faq:
- "q: How can I make this dish spicier? a: Add crushed red pepper to garlic mix. Spice needs balancing. Don’t overdo it though. Check heat level."
- "q: What if I can't find absinthe? a: Use pastis instead. Or try ouzo. Different taste slightly, keep it close. Both add anise flavor to dish."
- "q: What's the best way to store leftovers? a: Store in airtight container. Refrigerate for a day or two. Reheat on low heat. Avoid microwave."
- "q: Are there gluten-free options for accompanying dishes? a: Yes. Serve with gluten-free bread or crackers. Veggies also work well. Fresh salads are great."
