ingredients:
- "1 container lemon curd about 12 ounces"
- "8 ounces cream cheese softened"
- "1 large egg"
- "3/4 cup granulated sugar"
- "1 box dry lemon or vanilla cake mix 15.25 ounces"
- "1 cup unsalted butter sliced thinly or use frozen butter pats"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven 335°F adjust slightly lower for even browning; hotter ovens risk burning topping before filling bubbles."
- "Spread lemon curd firmly but not smeared flat in bottom of 9x13-inch baking dish. Leave some thickness to maintain layer distinctness."
- "In medium mixing bowl, beat softened cream cheese, egg, and sugar until no lumps remain but don’t overwhip into foam. Mixture should be creamy and dense."
- "Drop spoonfuls of cream cheese mixture randomly over lemon curd—not spread flat. Pockets create texture variation after baking."
- "Sprinkle dry cake mix evenly over lemon and cream cheese layers. Don’t press down. Cake mix stays loose for butter to absorb and crust to form."
- "Slice very thin pats of butter or use frozen cubes and scatter completely over cake mix layer. Cover as much dry cake as possible. Thin butter ensures crisp topping rather than soggy pockets."
- "Place in oven center rack. Bake 38-43 minutes. Watch for edges bubbling loudly and top turning golden amber with some darker brown spots around edges."
- "Pull from oven when edges bubble vigorously and top looks toasted. Jiggly center is fine; residual heat finishes it."
- "Rest uncovered 12-15 minutes before serving. Settling lets filling thicken and topping set without sogginess. Better texture, easier slicing."
introduction: "Dump cakes cut corners but demand the right balance. Lemon curd at base for tart zip holds moisture beneath. Cream cheese whipped just enough adds richness without curdling or graininess. Dry cake mix on top, untouched, draws in butter and browns into crust that crunches when you bite. Watch the oven: bubbling edges are your timer; that golden brown top? That’s your visual cue. Rest it after baking for firmer slices. Too hot an oven ruins texture; too cold and topping sogs. Simple, layered, fast. Add a pinch of lemon zest or swap cake mix for a spiced one for twist. Trust your eyes, ears, touch."
ingredientsNote: "Cream cheese must be softened for easier mixing and better texture without lumps. If unavailable, use mascarpone or ricotta strained well (less tang, more cream). Lemon curd can be homemade or store-bought; homemade adds freshness but store-bought is consistent. For butter, unsalted gives control over salt; salted butter might push sodium higher. Thin slices ensure even melting—chunky butter melts unevenly and leaves greasy spots. Cake mix choice shifts outcome: lemon flavor best but vanilla or white cake mix keeps neutral base. If gluten-free needed, use GF cake mix but expect slightly different crust texture."
instructionsNote: "Oven temperature matters; 335°F is just right to brown slowly while allowing filling to bubble fully before crust burns. Spread curd with a firm but gentle hand to keep layers intact—too thin means filling disappears into crust. Don’t overmix cream cheese; too much beating traps air and creates uneven bubbles. Dropping spoonfuls instead of spreading cream cheese creates interesting pockets of gooey texture inside final bake. Loose cake mix lets butter saturate pieces evenly; pressing compacts cake and blocks butter absorption. Butter layer coverage dictates crust quality: more butter means richer, crispier crust; less can cause dry topping. Resting lets filling thicken; slice too soon and filling runs. Clean knife after each cut for neat slices."
tips:
- "Use softened cream cheese; blends easier, no lumps. If unavailable, mascarpone or well-drained ricotta. Store-bought lemon curd works too—consistent."
- "Preheat oven to 335°F; ensures even browning. Hotter risks burning topping, cooler means soggy crust. Watch for that bubbling sound and golden edges."
- "When dropping cream cheese, don’t spread; create texture pockets instead. More interesting results when spooning rather than pressing all flat."
- "Slice butter thinly; very thin pats melt better. Butter needs to cover dry cake mix fully. Even melting prevents greasy spots and soggy areas."
- "Rest uncovered 12-15 minutes post-baking; allows filling to thicken. Cutting too soon leads to runny slices. Clean knife for neat cuts every time."
faq:
- "q: How to prevent soggy crust? a: Oven temp matters. 335°F is key. Enough butter coverage too. Soggy can come from too much moisture below."
- "q: Can I use different cake mix? a: Yes! Vanilla or spiced cake works if lemon isn’t on hand. Texture changes slightly though, be prepared."
- "q: Storage for leftovers? a: Refrigerate covered for 3-4 days. Can freeze too but texture varies after thawing. Best fresh though."
- "q: What if I lack lemon curd? a: Make your own or use another fruit filling. Try something berry or even an apple mix. Adjust sweetness accordingly."
