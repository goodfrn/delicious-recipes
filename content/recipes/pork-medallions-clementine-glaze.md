ingredients:
- "175 ml fresh clementine juice (about 7-8 clementines)"
- "10 ml honey"
- "7 ml arrowroot powder"
- "5 ml Dijon mustard"
- "2 pork tenderloin fillets, sliced into 2.5 cm thick medallions"
- "25 ml olive oil"
- "1 small shallot, finely chopped"
- "1 small garlic clove, minced"
- "20 ml butter"
- "15 ml apple cider vinegar"
- "1 sprig fresh thyme"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Mix clementine juice, honey, arrowroot powder, and Dijon mustard. Set aside."
- "Heat oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Brown pork medallions 1.5 minutes per side. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from pan to plate."
- "Add butter to same skillet. Sauté shallots and garlic until translucent, about 3 minutes."
- "Deglaze pan with apple cider vinegar. Add fresh thyme sprig."
- "Pour in clementine mixture. Stir and bring to low boil, stir constantly to thicken slightly."
- "Return pork to skillet. Lower heat to medium-low. Cook until medallions are cooked through and sauce is glossy, about 5 minutes."
- "Discard thyme. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve immediately. Goes well with roasted fingerling potatoes and steamed green beans."
introduction: "Clementines squeezed fresh. Sharp honeyed juice with mustard tang. Pork cut thick, seared to lock juices. Quick pan dance. Aromas of thyme and garlic mingle. Saucy glaze thickens, coats. Sweet, tart, savory mashup. Simple protein dressed up. Fast but fancy. Skip the long slow cook. Keep it sharp, bright. Medallions ready before you blink. Serve hot; sauce sticky enough to hold on but light enough to sip. Potatoes and green beans play straight man to this bold pork spectacle."
ingredientsNote: "Switched original measures down by about 30 percent to better balance flavors. Clementine juice comes fresh because canned misses the brightness; at least 7 clementines needed. Arrowroot powder does double-duty here: clearer glaze and a bit more shine than cornstarch. Dijon stands but apple cider vinegar softens acidity, blends better with thyme. Fresh thyme tip: add early for infusion, remove before serving. Keep garlic and shallot finely minced to melt right into the sauce. Pork tenderloin sliced thick, ensures juicy bites not dry scraps. Olive oil for searing replaced some butter for browning with less burn risk."
instructionsNote: "Heat oil ahead so pork sizzles on contact. Don't crowd pan or you’ll steam, no sear. Timing critical: 1.5 minutes each side for a browned crust and medium rare center. Remove pork before sauce build. Sauté shallots and garlic low and slow until translucent but no browning to avoid bitterness. Vinegar deglaze brings up fond flavors; add fresh thyme early to release herb oils. Pour clementine-honey mix last, whisk to avoid lumps. Simmer on medium to thicken patiently, arrowroot sets quickly but don’t boil long or sauce thins again. Return pork just to warm through, keep tender. Quick, deliberate, repeat tasting for salt and pepper. Fresh thyme goes in, comes out. Serve immediately or sauce loses sheen and thick glaze effect fades."
tips:
- "Fresh clementine juice is a must. Canned just dulls the flavor. About 7 to 8 clementines give you enough. Squeeze them right before starting. Bright, tangy juice makes a big difference."
- "Use a hot skillet. Oil must shimmer, then add pork. Don’t crowd the pan. Too many at once steams meat instead of searing. Sear each medallion for 1.5 minutes. Achieve a beautifully browned crust."
- "Butter adds flavor but can burn. Balance it with olive oil for frying. Oil stands higher heat. Butter brings richness. Together, they create a great sear without bitterness. Adjust how you use each."
- "Arrowroot powder works quickly. Mix it with clementine juice before adding to sauce. Thickens smoother than cornstarch. Avoid lumps. Stir constantly right after adding. Patience helps the sauce shine."
- "Watch the heat after returning pork to the skillet. You want to warm the medallions gently. Too high heat, and they lose tenderness. Temperature is crucial; keep it medium-low for best results."
faq:
- "q: How do I know the medallions are cooked through? a: Use a meat thermometer to check. 145 degrees Fahrenheit is safe. Juices should run clear. Slightly pink inside is normal."
- "q: Can I make this ahead of time? a: Yes, prepare sauce ahead. Store separately. Heat up before serving. But reheat medallions gently. Don't overdo it, or they’ll dry out."
- "q: What should I serve with this dish? a: Roasted fingerling potatoes pair nicely. Steamed green beans also work. Both maintain brightness. Don't overpower the glazed pork."
- "q: Can I freeze leftovers? a: Yes, but best to freeze medallions without sauce. Sauce can separate. Store separately and use within a month. Reheat gently for best texture."
