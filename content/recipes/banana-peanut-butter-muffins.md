- "150 ml milk"
- "3 ml pure vanilla extract"
- "60 ml chopped roasted pumpkin seeds"

instructions:
- "Position oven rack center. Preheat oven to 200°C. Line 12 muffin tins with paper liners."
- "In small bowl, mash banana with lemon juice roughly. Set aside."
- "In separate bowl, whisk flour with baking powder. Keep for later."
- "In mixing bowl, beat butter with brown sugar and almond butter until creamy."
- "Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition."
- "Slowly combine dry ingredients alternately with banana puree, milk, and vanilla extract. Mix just until combined."
- "Distribute batter evenly into muffin cups. Sprinkle with pumpkin seeds on top."
- "Bake approximately 35 minutes until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean."
- "Remove from oven, cool on wire rack."

introduction: "Banana and peanut butter mash. Tang of lemon juice. Flour and powder, mixed. Butter, sugar, almond butter instead of peanut, beaten smooth. Eggs, milk, vanilla thrown in. Roasted pumpkin seeds swap out peanuts. Batter settled in muffin tins, seeds sprinkled. Bake a little longer than usual. Toothpick test. Bananas sliced thick. Dollops of jam beside. Sweet, nutty, soft. No nuts, but still punchy. Quick breakfast. Snack or dessert. Dense. Moist. Jammy. Crunchy top. A shift away from the classic, a subtle twist. Simple, not fussy. Ready in an hour or so."
ingredientsNote: "Bananas must be ripe to lend natural sweetness and moisture. Lemon juice avoids browning and adds a hint of tartness. Using almond butter swaps the peanut element, keeping flavor but removing peanuts for nut-sensitive diets—feel free to try sunflower seed butter too. Pumpkin seeds provide the crunch instead of peanuts, more subtle but still satisfying. Brown sugar deepens the flavor better than white for this blend. Flour measurements altered down slightly to keep the texture moist but not dense. Vanilla is pure concentrate, a teaspoon reduced to three milliliters to balance the taste. Feel free to choose your preferred milk—dairy or plant-based. Adjust chopped seeds amount as desired for texture variation."
instructionsNote: "Preheat the oven hotter than usual; this compensates for wetter batter from banana and milk increases. Grease muffin liners or paper for easy release. Mash banana with lemon first to keep from darkening and add a subtle acid punch. Whisk dry components separately to ensure even rising agents before adding to wet mix. Cream butter and sugar well to aerate, important since the butter substitutes a third of the fat with almond butter. Beat eggs slowly, one at a time, integrating fully. Add dry ingredients in portions between milk and banana to avoid overmixing—results in lighter crumb. Spoon batter evenly so baking is uniform. Sprinkle seeds on top rather than inside for crunch texture on bite. Bake until tops golden and toothpick clean, usually closer to 35 minutes here. Cool on wire rack to prevent soggy bottoms. When serving, fresh banana slices keep moistness balanced; jam topping adds sweet acidity and freshness. Leftover muffins freeze well wrapped tightly."
tips:
- "Use ripe bananas. Essential for natural sweetness. Helps with moisture too. Lemon juice added. Keeps bananas from browning. Adds slight tang."
- "Whisk flour and baking powder separately. Important for even rising. Helps batter mix better. Mix dry in stages with wet ingredients. Avoids overmixing."
- "Mash bananas properly. Set aside first. Cream butter and sugars until smooth. This aerates mixture. Important for light texture. Eggs next, one by one."
- "Keep pumpkin seeds crunchy. Sprinkle on top not mixed in. Change texture of muffins. Seeds add interesting bite. Works same with sunflower seeds."
- "Bake muffins until golden. Do the toothpick test. Usually around 35 minutes. Ovens vary, check for doneness. Cool muffins on rack to avoid sogginess."
faq:
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Can freeze muffins. Wrap tightly. Keeps flavor and texture. Refrigerate too if preferred."
- "q: What if I don’t have almond butter? a: Swap for any nut butter. Peanut butter works great. Or use sunflower seed butter."
- "q: Can I make these without eggs? a: Try applesauce or flaxseed meal. Adds moisture. Change texture some. Experiment with ratios."
- "q: How do I adjust sugar levels? a: Reduce brown sugar if needed. But muffins may taste less sweet. Increase bananas for natural sweetness."
