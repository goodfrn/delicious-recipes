slug: "smoky-chicken-tamales"
description: "Corn husks softened in hot water grab attention first. Masa mix gritty, with cayenne swapped for smoked paprika — deeper fire, less heat sneaking up. Chicken filling fused with roasted poblanos and charred red onion for earth and subtle sweet. Wrapped tight in husks, double-locked in foil for even steam, they get a barbecue bath, flipped enough times to hear sizzle and smell roasting corn and spices mingle. Optional final unwrapping crisps husks gently for aroma and bite before salsa delivery. Texture balancing here essential — soft, moist masa with firm chicken and crispy husk edges. Timing based on feel and look, not the clock."
metaDescription: "Smoky Chicken Tamales are an explosion of flavor with roasted peppers, savory chicken, and grilled kernels wrapped perfectly in corn husks."
ogDescription: "Smoky Chicken Tamales deliver rich textures. Tender masa, firm chicken, and crispy edges — grill for that aromatic touch."

ingredients:
- "6 corn husks, intact with some nerves removed"
- "6 squares aluminum foil, about 30 cm each"
- "500 ml corn flour (masa harina), sifted"
- "8 ml baking powder, 1 teaspoon"
- "4 ml fine sea salt"
- "10 ml smoked paprika, 2 teaspoons"
- "120 ml cold lard or coconut oil, diced"
- "160 ml rich chicken stock"
- "2 poblano peppers, charred, peeled, diced"
- "1 med red onion, finely chopped and grilled"
- "2 cloves garlic, minced"
- "15 ml butter or oil"
- "1 tomato, chopped"
- "700 ml shredded roast chicken"
- "45 ml fresh cilantro, chopped"
- "Salt and pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "=== Corn Husks ==="
- "Trim husks to remove torn pieces holding structure. Score each from base to tip carefully to ease peeling. Soak husks in near-boiling water, not full boil, for 25-35 minutes till flexible but not soggy. Drain flat to prep wrapping."
- "=== Masa Preparation ==="
- "In a mixing bowl, combine sifted corn flour, baking powder, salt, smoked paprika. Cut in cold lard with fingertips until mix has coarse crumbs and small clumps — texture matters here. Gradually add cold stock while kneading lightly by hand until dough holds shape, soft but not sticky. Cover with damp towel, rest 20 minutes."
- "=== Filling ==="
- "Char poblano peppers fully on grill or open flame until skin blackens and blisters. Transfer to covered bowl to steam 15 minutes; peel and dices skinless flesh. Grill chopped red onion in pan with butter over medium until translucent and slightly charred edges form. Add garlic, cook 1 minute until fragrant. Mix in tomato and poblanos, sweat briefly (~2 minutes), add shredded chicken and cilantro. Season with salt and pepper to your taste."
- "=== Assembly and Cooking ==="
- "Set grill to medium heat. Pat dry husks well. Spread a golf ball-size masa onto inner husk side — thin but even. Place 2 tbsp filling center; fold husk over to encase filling tightly, fold ends under to seal. Wrap each tightly in aluminum foil squares, twisting edges to lock."
- "Grill tamales 25-35 minutes, flipping every 8-10 minutes for even heat. Look for firm, set masa with slight pull from husk. Optional unwrap and grill 5 more minutes directly on grates to toast husk edges, smell that toasty corn aroma."
- "Serve with your favorite fresh salsa or pickled vegetables."
introduction: "Stuffed corn dough, charred peppers, grilled chicken. Not just thrown in a pot. Learn the art of husk prep and soaking — keep husks bendy, not mush. Masa isn’t just flour and water. Powder rising, fat for flakiness; that fundamental texture changes everything. Char peppers till black spots buzz like a firecracker giving smoky depth. Onion burnt edges carry sweetness that cuts through richness of chicken. Wrapping tight in husks then foil traps steam, cooks evenly without soggy patches. Grill time? Not stopwatch. Firm feel, slight tug on dough from husk, aroma of roasting corn and spices. Speed and care combined. Confidence over guesswork."
ingredientsNote: "Swap butter for coconut oil or lard for crispier masa. Smoked paprika in place of chili powder adds deep woody tone without burning tongue mid-bite. Poblano peppers sub blackened chilies but less heat, more earth; red onion swapped for grilled white onion offers bolder flavor punch. Stock matters — homemade or rich broth enhances depth, avoid watery bases. Husks soaked hot to soften but not floppy, or risk tearing at assembly. Corn flour freshness affects elasticity — old stock leads to dry masa; test with water pinch before crafting dough. Double foil wrap ensures no steam leak; single often dries tamales too fast. Chicken roasting leftovers shine here; moist, not dry, shredded cleanly past tendons is key."
instructionsNote: "Husk soaking critical; too long turns fragile, too short snaps when wrapping. Rely on hand feel more than clock — pliable but firm. Masa texture: grainy but holds shape under pressure. Overmix scrambles structure, under mix leaves dry bites. When cutting peppers, blister skin only; peel carefully or bitterness remains. Sauté onions on moderate heat to coax natural sugars but avoid burning — black edges okay; carbon is flavor. Folding husks tightly traps steam, no leaks; seal foil ends well or moisture escapes, tamales dry. Flip tamales every 8-10 minutes; listen for subtle crackle, cooking evenly. Final husk grill optional but adds crunch and smoky perfume. Salsa from store fine but homemade pico brightens balance. Check salt before serving. Patience rewards with layers of texture and smell that hit the kitchen hard."
tips:
- "Husk prep is critical. Trim them right; torn edges cause issues later. Soak in hot water — not boiling. Flexibility matters; aim for bend, not mush."
- "Masa texture matters — should feel gritty but hold when pressed. Cold fats mix into coarse crumbs. That's the goal. Adds flakiness to the final dish."
- "Chicken shredding should be clean, not stringy. Moist meat matters. Consider leftovers, they shine in this. Dry chicken ruins the bite. Watch for that."
- "Grilling technique matters. Flip tamales regularly — 8 to 10 minutes. Firm feel, slight pulling from husk means readiness. Aroma should be intoxicating."
- "Want crispy edges? Unwrap for a few more minutes on grill, high heat. Just monitor, smoke adds depth, aroma signals uncooked masa."
faq:
- "q: What if my husks are too fragile? a: Trim them well before soaking. Soak too long turns mushy, too short causes tearing. Aim for nice balance."
- "q: How do I make masa without lard? a: Coconut oil works fine. Grease for flavor, texture. Butter can replace, but not for crispiness. Watch moisture levels."
- "q: What to do if filling spills out? a: Wrap tighter. Check husk folds, must encase filling well. A good seal prevents leaks, mess, enhances flavor."
- "q: How to store leftover tamales? a: Refrigerate in airtight container, 3 days max. Freeze later if necessary. Just reheat in steamer or grill. Maintain moisture."
