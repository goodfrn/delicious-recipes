slug: "sesame-shrimp-stir-fry"
description: "Quick sautéed shrimp with crisp snow peas, ginger, and a tangy hoisin-rice vinegar-soy sauce blend. Uses grapeseed oil and tamari for a slightly different flavor profile. The sauce balances acidity, umami, and a touch of heat from fresh chili. Serves 4. Ready in about 30 minutes. Tossed with green onion whites first, sprinkled with tops at the end. Keeps shrimp juices juicy, sears them fast to stay tender. Sesame seeds toasted separately for nuttiness. Great over jasmine or brown rice."

ingredients:
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) hoisin sauce"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) rice vinegar"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) tamari sauce"
- "600 g (1 1/3 lb) peeled deveined shrimp"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) grapeseed oil"
- "400 ml (1 2/3 cups) sliced snow peas"
- "5 scallions, thinly sliced whites and greens separated"
- "20 ml (4 tsp) toasted sesame seeds"
- "20 ml (1 tbsp) minced fresh ginger"
- "2 cloves garlic, minced"
- "1.5 ml (1/3 tsp) fresh chopped chili or to taste"
- "25 ml (1 2/3 tbsp) toasted sesame oil"
- "Optional - 100 g snap peas, sliced, for crunch twist"
instructions:
- "Mix hoisin, rice vinegar, tamari in a small bowl. Set aside."
- "Pat shrimp completely dry with paper towels. Moisture kills sear, remember."
- "Heat half grapeseed oil in wok or heavy skillet over very high heat. Add half shrimp, spread out. Listen to that sizzle, do not crowd or shrimp steam. Cook ~1 min each side until just turning pink and firm. Season lightly with salt. Remove to plate. Repeat with rest shrimp and oil."
- "In same pan, lower heat slightly. Add sesame oil, then ginger, garlic, sliced snow peas (and snap peas if using), and scallion whites. Stir-panfry briskly. Vegetables should stay crisp-tender; listen for light popping sounds; about 4 to 5 minutes max. Overcook and they'll get mushy."
- "Return shrimp to pan. Add sauce mixture. Toss gently, coating shrimp and veggies evenly. Cook another 1-2 minutes until sauce thickens and clings, shrimp fully cooked but juicy. Watch closely, reduce heat if sauce chars."
- "Turn off heat. Sprinkle green tops of scallion and toasted sesame seeds. Quick toss, then serve piping hot on jasmine or brown rice."
- "If no wok, use large heavy skillet. Keep oil hot but don't burn. Shrimp overcooked = rubbery—a frequent error. Dry shrimp well. Toast seeds in dry pan until they pop, smell nutty bright, before adding at the end."
introduction: "Shrimp sear fast—they don't wait for anyone. Dry surface key, oil screaming hot. In texture contrast, snow peas stay crunchy if you don’t overdo the heat. Ginger’s sharp, chili brings fire, touches up the sweet sour salt of the hoisin-rice vinegar-tamari blend—think layers of flavor steeping quickly. Tossed with scallions at two points—whites early to soften, greens last for fresh punch. Toasted sesame seeds bring that almost-hidden fragrance you only catch last minute. Don’t skip toasting. Grapeseed oil swaps in for olive here; cleaner high heat, less oil flavor fighting. Snap peas add a textural pop but optional. Keep everything moving in the pan; scramble is no good here."
ingredientsNote: "Altered hoisin, rice vinegar, and tamari (gluten-free soy sauce alternative) quantities cut by one-third for balance with added chili punch. Grapeseed oil replaces olive oil for cleaner high heat searing and less smoky aftertaste common in olive oils. Toast sesame seeds separately to avoid bitter burnt notes when heated with sauce. Snap peas swap in for some snow peas, add crunch and variety; if unavailable, just use more snow peas. Onion greens used dual stage—white for aroma, green for brightness. Fresh chopped chili replaces purée for better control over heat. Garlic and ginger fresh, never powder—vital for the kick and fragrance."
instructionsNote: "Dry shrimp well. Searing shrimp in batches improves caramelization, prevents steaming. Listen for the sizzle to know when oil’s hot—shrimp should sing when hitting pan, not hiss or bubble slowly. Don't crowd pan; shrimp must brown. After shrimp cooked, do not wash pan—let fond flavor the veggies. Stir-fry veggies fast, high heat, only until bright green with slight bite retains. Adding shrimp back with sauce—coat gently; over stirring breaks shrimp. Sauce thickens with carryover heat—stop cooking just shy of dryness. Toss scallion greens and toasted sesame last—heat will wake them without burning aroma. Emergency: No scallions? Use chives or fresh basil for fresh green punch. No hoisin? Mix equal parts molasses, soy sauce, and rice vinegar—adjust sweetness and acidity. Toast sesame seeds just till color deepens—no longer or bitter taste develops."
tips:
- "Dry shrimp completely first. Paper towels crucial here. Moist shrimp won't sear. Make oil scream hot. Hear it sizzle! That's your cue. Don't crowd pan. Allows browning."
- "Cook shrimp in batches. No steaming, only searing. Cook about a minute per side. Watch closely, they turn pink fast. Touch test for firmness. Remove without overcooking."
- "Adjust heat during stir-fry. Snow peas should pop and stay crisp, not mushy. So, steady stirring; keep them moving hot. If they start to soften, pull the pan off heat."
- "Toast sesame seeds before adding to dish. Dry pan, medium heat; watch them closely. Should turn golden and fragrant. Don't walk away; burnt seeds ruin flavor."
- "Want a twist? Add snap peas for texture. Just slice them and toss in with snow peas. Extra crunch gives a fun bite. They work nicely if you have them."
faq:
- "q: Can I use frozen shrimp? a: Yes, defrost them first. Dry well. Same drying rule applies. Fresh shrimp ideal, but frozen works if that's what you have."
- "q: What if I don't have hoisin sauce? a: Mix equal parts molasses and soy sauce. Add a splash of rice vinegar to balance. Adjust sweetness if needed. Works just fine."
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Keep in airtight container in fridge. Should stay good for about 2 days. Reheat gently to keep shrimp tender. Avoid microwave if you can."
- "q: What if I overcooked the shrimp? a: Solution first: don't panic. Shrimp can be tough if overdone. Next time, cook in smaller batches. Watch timing."
