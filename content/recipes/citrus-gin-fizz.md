ingredients:

- "600 ml (2 ½ cups) gin"
- "300 ml (1 ¼ cups) agave syrup"

- "850 ml (3 ½ cups) cold tonic water"
- "Ice cubes"
instructions:
- "Combine grapefruit juice, gin, agave syrup, and 7 sprigs thyme in a large pitcher or jar."
- "Press sprigs slightly to release oils before adding."
- "Chill the mixture for 18 to 22 hours in the fridge to let flavors meld."
- "Discard the thyme sprigs after infusing."
- "Before pouring, stir gently to mix settled syrup."
- "Fill glasses with ice cubes."
- "Add 90 ml (3 oz) of infused gin mixture to each glass."
- "Top off with 60 ml (2 oz) tonic water per serving."
- "Garnish each with a fresh thyme sprig."
introduction: "Grapefruit juice. Gin. Agave syrup — natural sweetness. Thyme instead of rosemary — sharper, greener, unexpected. Tonic water chilled, bubbly. Simple. Rested overnight. No fuss. This mix yields around 2 liters, or about 24 servings, so party ready. The cold tonic balances the sweet and bitter perfectly. Ice clinks, herbs float, citrus zings. Serve cold. Large pitcher. Easy for groups. Maceration time crucial for depth — 18 to 22 hours, not less. The long rest lets flavors marry. The herb swap changes the whole vibe; thyme adds a dry fresh note where rosemary lingered resinous."
ingredientsNote: "Freshness key. Grapefruit juice best fresh but bottled works fine too. Agave syrup smooth, less sweet than cane syrup — try to keep the balance light but noticeable. Gin selected should be clean and crisp, not overly juniper-heavy since grapefruit flavor stands out more. Thyme sprigs bruise gently, not pulverize, just enough to release oils. Reserve 7 for infusion and extra for garnish. Cold tonic water, best chilled long to avoid diluting the mix early. Ice cubes standard but plenty; serve drinks cold to keep them crisp and lively."
instructionsNote: "Start by bruising thyme sprigs slightly to trigger oils but keep stems intact. Mix juices, agave, gin, and herb in a clear container for easy monitoring of infusion. Timing is flexible but 18-22 hours cold is essential to develop fragrant, balanced notes without overpowering bitterness. After macerating, strain out herbs carefully to avoid bitterness or pulp. Stir lightly before serving to remix any settled syrup at the bottom. Each drink portion standardized at 90 ml mix plus 60 ml tonic; topping with tonic last maintains carbonation. Use fresh thyme sprig garnish for aroma release with every sip. Serve immediately over ice cubes for cold refreshment."
tips:
- "Use fresh grapefruit juice. Bottled is okay too. Agave syrup adds smoothness, but be cautious. Balance is key. Select a crisp gin. Avoid heavy juniper."
- "Bruise thyme gently. Releases essential oils. Don't overdo it. Seven sprigs for infusion. Reserve some extra for garnish. Cold tonic is a must. Keeps drink lively."
- "Maceraion time matters. Chill for 18-22 hours. Let flavors mingle, but don't rush. Remove thyme after infusion. Don't let bitterness sneak in. Simple steps work."
- "Ice is essential. Fill glasses up. Lots of ice cubes - serve cold. Each drink is 90 ml mix plus 60 ml tonic. Pour tonic last to keep fizz."
- "Garnish with thyme sprig. A nice touch. Enhances aroma as you sip. Drink cold for refreshment. This makes a lot, about 2 liters."
faq:
- "q: What's best way to serve? a: Serve cold with lots of ice. Mix is lively. Pour tonic last for carbonation. Glasses should be chilled too."
- "q: How long can I store it? a: Uses fresh ingredients, best served quick. Tonic loses fizz. Mix can last few days. Keep in fridge, sealed."
- "q: Can I use other herbs? a: Thyme is unique. Experiment with mint for sweetness. Basil offers different freshness. Try rosemary too."
- "q: What gin should I pick? a: Choose a clean gin. Strong juniper isn't ideal. Go with something light. Balance is crucial with grapefruit."
