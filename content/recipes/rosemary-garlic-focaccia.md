slug: "rosemary-garlic-focaccia"
description: "A reworked focaccia elevated with sage in place of rosemary and smoked sea salt substituting fleur de sel, alongside a splash of honey for subtle sweetness. Adjusted hydration and altered rising times for better crumb. Uses spelt and rye flour blend instead of all-purpose for added texture and nutrition. Cooked in a preheated cast iron skillet inside a pizza oven, focusing on tactile dough cues and visual blistering to guide timing. Ideal for 6-8 hungry portions, vegan and allergen-friendly."

ingredients:
- "300 g (2 cups) spelt flour"
- "75 g (1/2 cup) rye flour"
- "7 ml (1 1/2 tsp) sugar"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) instant yeast"
- "6 ml (1 tsp) fine sea salt"
- "280 ml (1 1/4 cup) lukewarm water"
- "50 ml (3 tbsp plus 1 tsp) olive oil"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) fresh sage leaves chopped"
- "1 clove garlic minced"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) honey"
- "smoked sea salt to taste"
instructions:
- "Mix flours, sugar, yeast, and salt in a large bowl or stand mixer bowl fitted with dough hook. Do this dry first so yeast disperses evenly."
- "Add lukewarm water and honey. Stir until a shaggy dough forms."
- "Knead by hand or mixer on medium low for 6-7 minutes until dough is soft but slightly tacky, elastic. Avoid over-kneading; dough should spring back when pressed. If too sticky, dust with a bit more flour but no more than needed."
- "Pour 20 ml of olive oil into a well-seasoned cast iron skillet. Transfer dough into it, turning to coat completely with oil. Stretch and press dough to edges of skillet. Don't worry if it resists; let it rest 5 minutes then try again."
- "Cover skillet with damp towel or cling film, place in draft-free warm spot for 1 hour 45 minutes. Dough should visibly swell, puff up, nearly double volume. Finger poke test: indent springs back slowly, leaving slight impression."
- "Preheat pizza oven to max heat 20 minutes with door closed. High intensity."
- "Drizzle remaining olive oil over dough. Using fingers, dimple dough surface deeply to create wells holding aroma and oil. Don't overdo or holes collapse."
- "Scatter sage and garlic evenly over top. Sprinkle smoked sea salt instead of regular for subtle smoky hit while baking."
- "Instead of full uncovered rest, let dough rise an additional 25 minutes uncovered inside warm oven on lower temp setting (about 70-90°C) so surface dries slightly and skin forms without cracking."
- "Reduce oven to lowest intensity (approx 1), bake focaccia 4 min with door closed. Then rotate skillet 180 degrees using handle for even exposure to radiant heat."
- "Continue baking 5-6 min until crust visibly golden with irregular brown spots, slight blistering."
- "Turn off oven, leave focaccia inside with door closed for 12-15 minutes. Residual heat finishes cooking interior without drying crust."
- "Remove skillet carefully; cool focaccia in pan 10-15 minutes until just luke warm. Slipping thin spatula around edges helps release it from pan walls."
- "Transfer to cutting board. Slice thick wedges, serve warm. Crisp edges give way to tender but structured crumb heavy with herb aroma and garlicky punch."
introduction: "Forget the usual straight flour swap and identical timing. This focaccia comes with checks on skin elasticity and visual cues instead of ticking clocks. Tender crumb with that rustic chew of rye and spelt, dark speckles of sage and the lingering smoke from salt. You’ll want to feel the dough’s resistance and listen for crackling when it comes out—oven roar, oil sizzling, garlic aroma thick in the air. Perfect for ripping apart with fingers dipped in olive oil or paired with a robust red. No fluff, just focused methods and real kitchen sense."
ingredientsNote: "Opt for spelt and rye for depth in flavor and better structure. All-purpose flour gets the job done but compromises texture. Honey replaces sugar delicately raising yeast activity without overpowering. Smoked sea salt brings a bold but balanced layer that regular fleur de sel lacks. Fresh sage swaps out rosemary here, lending earthiness that keeps focaccia interesting. Adjust oil slightly for easy handling and moisture balance. Lukewarm water crucial—too hot kills yeast, too cold stalls rising; test with finger to be just warm, not scalding."
instructionsNote: "Dry mix first ensures even yeast distribution. Stretch and fold the dough in skillet rather than aggressive kneading saves time and builds gluten gently. Watch dough swell more than clock times. Poke tests reveal readiness better than watches. Dimpling not just cosmetic—helps oil and herbs sink, stopping dry spots. Bake on low temp after high heat setting to develop crumb while crust crisps without burning. Turning skillet mid-bake avoids hot spots and uneven browning. Resting inside oven post-bake lets heat settle, finishing crumb cook without toughening crust. Use a thin spatula to free from pan; letting cool a bit avoids tearing. Serve warm—not piping hot—for best texture and aroma reveal."
tips:
- "Check elasticity. Dough needs to spring back when you poke it. Texture matters. Too sticky, add flour slowly. Don’t rush the resting time."
- "Sage substitutes? Try thyme or oregano. Strong flavors balance the smoke of sea salt. Adjust oil if dough feels dry. Always feel for proper hydration."
- "Two rise times. First—warm spot. Second, watch the oven temp. Let surface dry slightly before baking; ensures a good crust without cracks."
- "Skillet choice matters. Cast iron heats evenly, good crust. Rotate too, prevents hot spots. Make sure dough's oiled well for easy release post-bake."
- "Wait before slicing. Let it cool a bit in the pan. Keeps the texture intact. Enjoy the aromas wafting. Fresh herbs add layers to each bite."
faq:
- "q: Why skip all-purpose flour? a: Spelt, rye add flavor and nutrition. All-purpose can dull texture. Doesn’t rise same way. Looser crumb less chewy."
- "q: What if it’s not rising? a: Check the yeast. Old yeast can stall. Warm water's important; just warm, not scalding. Try again. Patience helps."
- "q: Storing focaccia? a: Wrap loosely. Room temp, lasts days. Freeze it if longer; slice first, reheat in oven. Keeps texture better than microwaving."
- "q: Can I add toppings? a: Yes, olives or sundried tomatoes can work. Just be cautious with moisture. Adjust bake time if overloaded with extras."
