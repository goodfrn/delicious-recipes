description: "A frozen treat made from chocolate almond milk, vanilla protein powder, and sugar-free instant pudding powder. Swapped classic Oreos for crunchy cinnamon graham crackers, adding a warm twist. Salt balances sweetness; no lid freezing prevents blade damage. Whisked with a handheld frother for fluffier mix. Freeze uncovered for 23 hours, spin on light ice cream mode, then fold in crunchy mix-ins with a single pulse. Texture creamy with bits of spice. A practical method that prevents icy clumps. Serves one pint. Kitchen-tested and foolproof."

ingredients:
- "1 cup unsweetened chocolate almond milk"
- "1 scoop vanilla whey protein powder"
- "1 ½ tbsp sugar-free instant vanilla pudding powder"
- "⅛ tsp kosher salt"
- "5 cinnamon graham cracker crumbs plus extra for topping"
instructions:
- "===Mix Base==="
- "Pour the chocolate almond milk, vanilla protein powder, pudding powder, and salt into an empty CREAMi™ pint container. Using an electric milk frother or a vigorous whisk, beat until the ingredients disappear into a silky, uniform mix. Avoid overfoaming; just steady and thorough. No lumps. This step ensures powder hydration, preventing gritty final texture."
- "===Freeze==="
- "Place the pint directly on a flat freezer shelf, lid off. Leave at least 23 hours. Frost forming on the top surface means it’s setting well; don’t cover with lid or plastic wrap—traps moisture and causes that annoying peak that can destroy your blade when spinning."
- "===Prepare Machine==="
- "Take out the pint, wipe any frost from rim. Insert into the CREAMi™ outer bowl, secure lid firmly. Lock the lid shut and assemble onto the motor base. Twist the handle clockwise to lift the platform, locking in place. Make sure it’s seated properly for smooth operation."
- "===Spin Base==="
- "Select the Lite Ice Cream program and start. Listen for the consistent whoosh of the blade; pause means jammed mix—usually bad freezing or powder clumps. If too soft or too icy, a second spin of the same program helps without overwhipping, which melts texture."
- "===Add Mix-ins==="
- "Using a spoon, dig a 1½-inch well in center of the ice cream after spinning. Drop in 4-5 crushed cinnamon graham cracker pieces. Run the mix-in program once. One swirl, not overdoing. Larger chunks crush machine blades."
- "===Serve==="
- "Remove pint, sprinkle crushed crackers over the top. Soft cream, cold but not frozen solid, with cinnamon arcs in every bite. Serve immediately for best texture. Leftover? Freeze sealed but thaw slightly 5-10 minutes before digging in again."
- "===Troubleshooting==="
- "Too icy? Next batch, increase pudding powder slightly or reduce freeze time by an hour. Too soft? Check freezer temp or freeze with lid off longer. Powder clumps? Pre-sift powders or blend dry ingredients first."
introduction: "Chocolate ice cream with protein. Almond milk instead of dairy—lighter, less chance of icy patches. Vanilla instead of chocolate protein powder—brings out pudding’s flavor. Switched from Oreos to cinnamon graham crackers for crunch and a warm punch. Keep the lid off during freezing; that peak spells trouble and broken blades. A quick whirl with a frother minimizes lumps—precision, no guesswork here. Freeze for 23 hours; patience pays. CREAMi™ steps fixed. Know the noisy blade hum—that’s good. Timing’s flexible ±5%. Mix-ins go in once, not soaked. Crunch redistributes evenly, not pulverized. Serve straight from the pint, sprinkle extra crackers, enjoy the contrast. Kitchen science not guesswork."
ingredientsNote: "Chocolate almond milk works well for creaminess minus heaviness; if allergic to nuts, sub oat or soy milk but expect slight flavor shift. Vanilla whey beats chocolate powder here; chocolate protein often thickens too much and dulls pudding notes. Sugar-free vanilla pudding powder cuts calories but if unavailable, regular instant vanilla pudding powder is okay—reduce mix-in sugar accordingly. Salt—tiny pinch clears latent sweetness, balances the chocolate. Cinnamon graham crackers swapped for Oreos because they add nuanced spice and crunch without mess or overly sweet chunks. Crushed finely so they don’t jam blades; whole cookies break equipment. If no CREAMi™, freezepint and blend in a high-speed blender for 30 seconds; freeze again briefly. No frost-covered lids; always open during freeze."
instructionsNote: "Use a consistent whisk or milk frother for thorough incorporation of powders. Avoid clumps—they show up frozen and cause blade stress. Freezing uncovered is critical—lid traps moisture, creates a frost 'hump' that guillotines blades. Watch freeze time; slightly soft to firm but not rock solid. Ambient freezer temps may vary; test with your kitchen conditions. Lifting and locking the pint in the machine is essential; misalign and blades stall or spin unevenly. First spin program—stop there. Over spinning creates heat, melting texture. Mix-in scoop carefully; no deeper or wider than 1½ inches to avoid hollow spots and balance distribution. Multiple mix-in runs pulverize add-ins and ruin crunch. Serve right away—texture degrades with time. Leftovers freeze hard; thaw briefly to revive scoopability."
tips:
- "Start by whisking chocolate almond milk with protein powder—no clumps allowed. Blend until they disappear completely. Avoid over-air—keep it dense. Remember, balanced texture is key here. If you find clumps, run a sifter next time or mix powder beforehand."
- "Freeze uncovered for max 23 hours—yes, keeping the lid off helps prevent ice bumps. Those bumps can damage blades—no one wants broken equipment. Frost is a good sign on top. Coolness needs to permeate throughout. Watch the surface, it's crucial."
- "Post-spin, create a small well in the ice cream before adding mix-ins. That's where you drop the crushed graham crackers. One light swirl with the mix-in program is ideal. Don't pound them into the mix—big chunks jam blades. Keep it gentle."
- "Serving immediately gives the best texture; warmer cream has a creamy mouthfeel. Leftovers freeze solid—thaw for 5-10 minutes before trying to scoop again. Storing sealed stops ice from forming, but don’t leave it too long. Get that optimal gobble right away."
- "Use alternatives like oat or soy milk if allergic to almonds. Adjust sweetness if you opt for regular pudding. Just watch out for texture shifts—sweetness might shift. If your ice cream turns icy next time, slightly increase pudding powder or reduce freezing time."
faq:
- "q: What's the key if ice cream gets icy? a: Increase the pudding powder. Try reducing freeze time by an hour. No fixes? Check your freezer temp; sometimes it's too cold."
- "q: How to fix a soft ice cream? a: Check that freezer temp isn’t off. Ensure pint is freezing long enough—more hours can work but keep that lid off. Try spinning longer; just don’t overdo it."
- "q: Longer freezing time creates frost—what to do? a: Don't cover the pint at all. Frost means good freeze—but freezing too long brings ice. Experiment with your timing; every kitchen's different."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Seal pint tightly. Store in the coldest section of freezer. Thaw slightly when serving—too hard to scoop? Aim for 5-10 minutes but not too long—avoid complete melt."
