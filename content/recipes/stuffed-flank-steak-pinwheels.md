slug: "stuffed-flank-steak-pinwheels"
description: "Flatten flank steak thin but avoid tears. Sauté mushroom, shallot, garlic mix until volume halves, cooling before spreading. Use feta and goat cheese for tang. Roll tight enough to hold but gentle on filling. Season outside with smoked paprika blend. Pour beef broth under, not over, roast. Bake at 380°F until internal temp hits 130°F mid-rare to medium. Rest 8-10 minutes. Slice into pinwheels, reveal spiraled filling. Perfect for visual and flavor impact."

ingredients:
- "2 lb flank steak, butterflied and tenderized"
- "1 1/4 cups chopped cremini mushrooms"
- "1/4 cup finely chopped shallots"
- "3 cloves garlic, minced"
- "2 tbsp chopped fresh Italian parsley"
- "1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese"
- "1/2 cup crumbled goat cheese"
- "1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil"
- "1 tsp salt, divided"
- "1/2 tsp white pepper, divided"
- "1 tsp smoked paprika"
- "1/2 tsp garlic powder"
- "1/2 tsp onion powder"
- "1 tsp vegetable oil"
- "10 oz beef broth"
instructions:
- "Butterfly the flank steak as thin as you can without making holes. Use a meat mallet gently, starting from the center and working outward. Paper towel under steak stops mess."
- "Preheat oven to 380°F. Spray 9x13 glass baking dish. Keep handy."
- "Heat vegetable oil in pan over medium heat. Toss mushrooms, shallots, parsley, garlic in. Stir often until volume shrinks about half. Aroma should turn earthy, garlic fragrant and onions softened. About 8 minutes. Remove from heat to cool."
- "Season flattened steak with half salt and white pepper evenly on laid out surface. Spread mushroom mixture over leaving 1/2 inch border around edges to prevent spill."
- "Sprinkle evenly with the mixed feta and goat cheese, adding creamy tang and tangy notes."
- "Roll steak tightly but gently, lengthwise along grain. Don’t over-tighten or filling bulges out. Tie securely with kitchen twine at 1- to 1.5-inch intervals."
- "Rub rolled roast with olive oil coat. Mix remaining salt, pepper, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder. Massage spice blend over roast exterior."
- "Place in prepared baking dish. Pour beef broth into dish but avoid pouring on roast—moisture around but keep crust dry."
- "Bake 40-45 minutes. Check internal temp with probe thermometer. Stop at 130°F for medium-rare to medium temp range. The crust will be browned, spices aromatic, broth simmering."
- "Remove and tent with foil for 8 to 10 minutes rest. Meat juices redistribute, hold shape."
- "Slice into 1-inch pinwheels. Spirals clear, filling intact. Juicy and tender, spices toasted."
- "Serve immediately. Leftovers reheat gently wrapped in foil or sliced cold over greens."
introduction: "Flank steak’s a tough cut if mishandled. Flatten and butterfly to gain surface area for rolling and even cooking. Don’t rush this; holes turn this into meat shreds and leaks the filling. Mushrooms and shallots cook down until their scent fills the kitchen, signaling when moisture evaporates and flavors concentrate. Cheese choice matters. Switching feta for a blend of feta and goat cheese adds creaminess without overpowering the meat and mushrooms. Rolling can be fiddly—loose and everything spills, tight and you squeeze out juices. Seasoning both inside and out builds layers. Smoked paprika gives the crust a hint of subtle fire without heat. Broth keeps the pan moist but don’t drown the roast or the crust will steam instead of crisp. Resting stops juice runoff and allows easier slicing. This isn’t delicate, it’s about controlled technique and knowing when you nailed the internal temp. Slice and reveal your efforts. Can serve hot or cold; great flexibility. Trouble with tight rolls? Chill for 10 before baking for firmer shape."
ingredientsNote: "Flank steak can come uneven—look for one uniform thickness or butterfly carefully to even the thickness. If unavailable, skirt steak can substitute but watch for thinner size. Mushrooms act as moisture reservoirs; cremini offers deeper flavor but button mushrooms work fine. Shallots swap sweet onion if necessary—shallots more subtle and less pungent but onions do the job. Feta and goat cheeses bring tang; replace with blue cheese for more punch if preferred. Olive oil rub seals in spices and encourages crust formation; vegetable oil works but lacks flavor. Beef broth for braising liquid is key, but water with a beef bouillon cube works in a pinch. Resting loosely covered helps hold temperature but avoid tight wrap that traps steam."
instructionsNote: "Butterflying is key. Lay steak flat, slice horizontally almost halfway through, open like a book. Mallet carefully from center outwards. Avoid punctures by padding beneath and not hammering thin edges too hard. Sauté mushrooms until visibly shrunk and thickened—raw mushrooms spoil texture. Cooling filling prevents melting cheese and soggy meat. Seasoning inside the roll promotes balanced flavor; outside seasoning defines crust. Use instant-read thermometers to nail doneness—feel and time unreliable with varying steak thickness. Pour broth around meat to add moisture without diluting crust. Cook times vary; start checking temps at 35 minutes. Resting allows juiciness redistribution critical to avoid dry cuts. Slicing at 1 inch balances visual appeal and portioning—too thin and it falls apart. Twine removal after slicing is easier if snipped carefully. If overcooked, add pan drippings or some softened butter to add moisture when serving."
tips:
- "Use a meat mallet but don’t pound too hard. Start in the center of the flank steak. Flatten with gentle force. Avoid tearing the meat, that's crucial. Use paper towels beneath to absorb mess."
- "Keep your filling cool. Hot filling leads to melted cheese, soggy texture. Cooling helps maintain the rolled shape. Mix cheese evenly for balanced flavors. Use feta and goat cheese or swap for blue cheese."
- "Watch the timing on both cooking and resting. Resting is vital to redistribute juices. Cuts before resting lead to dry meat. Check internal temp with a probe thermometer; around 130°F is key."
- "If you struggle with rolling, consider chilling the filled steak for about 10 minutes before baking. It firms up. Helps hold shape. Don’t over-tighten your rolls. Loose rolls can keep juices in."
- "If you don't have flank steak, skirt steak can work. Just monitor thickness closely. Not the same texture but works in a pinch. Can explore other mushroom varieties too; button mushrooms are fine."
faq:
- "q: What if my steak tears while butterflying? a: Start from the thickest part, slowly work your way out. Use a mallet gently to avoid holes. If you tear, patch with leftover steak pieces. Secure tightly before cooking."
- "q: How should I store leftovers? a: Wrap in foil, refrigerate. Reheat gently in the oven, not too hot. Sliced or whole; both are enjoyable cold or warm. Pan juices help rehydrate if dry."
- "q: How can I tell when it's done? a: Visual cues matter. Look for browned crust. Smell is key; aromatic spices fill the kitchen. Use a thermometer for core temp. 130°F indicates medium-rare."
- "q: What if I don’t have beef broth? a: Water is okay. Add in a beef bouillon cube, dissolving it to mimic broth. Be cautious, too much salt can overpower. Always check flavor. Liquid matters."
