ingredients:
- "60 ml olive oil (4 tbsp), divided"
- "1 large garlic clove, very finely grated"
- "2 lemons zest and juice"
- "3 ml dried tarragon (1/2 tsp)"
- "1 ml crushed red pepper flakes (1/4 tsp), optional"
- "600 g boneless skinless chicken thighs (about 1.3 lb), trimmed"
- "80 ml mayonnaise"
- "2 slices sourdough bread, 1.5 cm thick, brushed with olive oil"
- "1 bunch kale, tough stems removed, leaves lightly oiled"
- "100 g curly endive or frisée lettuce, torn"
- "3 radishes very thinly sliced on a mandoline"
- "Salt and pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Get grill ripping hot. Oil grate well — prevents sticking. Chicken needs that direct heat blast for color and seal."
- "Whisk together 45 ml olive oil, garlic, lemon zest and juice, tarragon, red pepper flakes; salt + pepper. Smells sharp, fresh. Pull 45 ml of this aside, toss chicken in it so thighs get even coating. Rest stays for dressing."
- "Add mayonnaise to leftover marinade; whisk until creamy, smooth. Chill until salad assembly. Keeps tang but adds body — swap mayo with plain Greek yogurt for lighter version or boost acidity with extra lemon if mayo too rich."
- "Onto grill, chicken on one half. Cook 7 to 9 minutes each side or until juices run clear and edges char nicely. Look for crisp caramelization, not gray. Slicing into one thigh mid-cook it should be opaque, not pink or rubbery."
- "Simultaneously grill sourdough on other half, 3 minutes per side, looking for golden grill marks. Removes raw edge, adds crunch."
- "Quickly sear kale leaves around one to two minutes per side, until just wilted and dark spots appear. Yes, slight blackening is good here — adds char flavor and breaks fibrous texture. Warning: avoid overcooking or leaves go bitter and limp."
- "Off grill, let chicken rest 5 minutes. Resting locks juices in rather than spilling onto cutting board, keeping meat moist. Meanwhile, roughly chop kale, remove thick stems (discard or compost — tough and bitter). Tear or chop bread into 2 cm cubes."
- "Slice chicken into bite-sized pieces against the grain for tenderness."
- "In large bowl combine kale, chicken, bread, frisée, and radish slices. Pour dressing over top. Toss gently but thoroughly. Dressing should just coat ingredients, not drown them; aim for balance between creamy tang and freshness."
- "Taste for seasoning; add salt and pepper if needed. Serve on a large platter or individual bowls. Optional finish with a few drops good olive oil or sprinkle of flaky sea salt for texture contrast."
- "If lacking grill, use cast iron pan at very high heat, turning chicken frequently to mimic char. Toast bread under broiler. For kale, sauté briefly in pan with hot oil until edges crisp."
introduction: "Charred edges crackle. Zing from lemon jumps out the moment marinade hits chicken. Garlic fragrance, except mild now, boosted by tarragon’s faint licorice note. Skip the plastic-wrapped limp lettuce experiences — kale and frisée bring texture and a touch of bitter green that slices through the creamy dressing. Radishes punctuate with crunch, color. Bread’s no afterthought; it’s a vehicle for sauce, charred for bite, integral. Salad built methodically but assembled just before serving — preserves crunch and freshness. Paired with smoky grilled chicken, makes a filling meal, satisfying but never heavy. Simple ingredients, complex layers — no need for fancy tricks."
ingredientsNote: "Olive oil quality matters — go extra virgin for flavor but use regular if cooking at very high temps to prevent burning. Garlic’s potency varies; taste raw, then decide whether to add more. Tarragon can be tricky: fresh preferred, but dried works if finely crushed. If sensitive to spice, omit crushed red pepper flakes or substitute with paprika for milder smoky depth. Mayonnaise can be swapped with Greek yogurt or even avocado for creamy texture and tang without dairy. Sourdough bread offers sturdy chew and open crumb; use country or pain de campagne. Kale — lacinato or dinosaur kale works well but tough stems must be removed to avoid fibrous bites. Radishes sliced thin are key — thick slices lose crunch and invite bitterness. If no grill available, adapt with hot pan and broiler as fallback; marinade flavors benefit from charring but char not mandatory."
instructionsNote: "High heat grilling unlocks flavors — crucial for caramelization and texture contrast between chicken and salad components. Chicken curiosity: pressing lightly tests doneness better than timers alone; springy, firm indicates ready. Resting chicken after grilling keeps juices restless inside meat fibers rather than puddled on plate or board. Keep marinade aside before adding chicken — half for marinating, half for dressing — harnesses the bright citrus notes both raw and cooked. Grilling bread avoids sogginess and lends smoky edge to salad; don’t skip brushing oil or it sticks and dries out unevenly. Kale grilling is less about cooking through and more about heightening flavor and softening stem toughness. Remove stems post-grill to simplify eating and remove stringiness; compost discarded stems. Toss salad at the last moment, dressing coats but doesn’t drown — maintaining contrast critical. Season dressing carefully; citrus marinade can be tart, balance with mayo or yogurt, salt to taste. If prepping ahead, keep dressing and salad separate and combine just before serving to avoid soggy leaves and bread."
tips:
- "High temps essential for grilling chicken. Visual cues matter. Look for char, crisp edges. Use tongs to flip. Observe texture; time varies."
- "For kale, leave the stems when grilling can lead to chewiness. Remove post-grill. Check for dark spots. Deals with fiber issues."
- "Sourdough's thickness affects grilling time. Thin slices can burn quickly. Brush oil liberally. Monitor closely, aiming for golden color."
- "Dressings can vary; swap mayo for Greek yogurt if looking for lighter options. Use fresh citrus if mayo feels heavy. Balance flavors."
- "When grilling, prep area. Oil grate before anything. Ensures food won’t stick. Timing is key for components; manage whose on grill when."
faq:
- "q: How do I know chicken is done? a: Juices running clear is one sign. On cutting, no pink visible. Firmness offers another clue. Don’t rely solely on time."
- "q: What if I don't have a grill? a: Hot cast iron pan works great. Use broiler for bread. High heat still can create char. Adapt but keep temp elevated."
- "q: Can I make this ahead of time? a: Prep chicken, kale early. Store separately. Combine just before serving. Dressing should not soak ingredients though."
- "q: What's the best way to store leftovers? a: Keep salad components dry. Store dressing apart. Overnight in fridge is fine. Toss fresh each meal."
