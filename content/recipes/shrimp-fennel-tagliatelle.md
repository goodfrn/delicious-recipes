ingredients:
- "250 g tagliatelle pasta (sub: linguine or fettuccine)"
- "350 g raw shrimp peeled and deveined (sub: large bay scallops)"
- "1 medium fennel bulb thinly sliced (use celery for less anise flavor)"
- "3 garlic cloves minced"
- "1 small red chili finely chopped (optional)"
- "Zest of 1 lemon"
- "350 ml vegetable broth (replace with seafood stock if preferred)"
- "40 ml olive oil"
- "30 g flat leaf parsley roughly chopped"
- "Sea salt and black pepper freshly ground"
- "2 tbsp dry white wine (optional, can skip)"
- "1 small shallot finely chopped"
instructions:
- "Heat olive oil in large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add shallot and cook until translucent, about 2 minutes. Avoid browning to keep sweetness intact."
- "Throw in sliced fennel. Stir frequently. You want softening and slight caramelization without blackened bits. Add pinch salt to help draw out moisture. About 8 minutes total."
- "Pour in vegetable broth plus white wine if using. Raise heat slightly so broth simmers gently. Cover pan loosely. Cook until fennel reaches tender-crisp stage. Use fork test but avoid soggy. Around 12-15 minutes."
- "Meanwhile, boil salted water for tagliatelle. Cook pasta 1 minute less than package suggests for al dente. Reserve 100 ml cooking water. Drain quickly."
- "Push fennel to side. Increase heat to medium-high. Sprinkle in garlic and chili. Sizzle should be immediate but don’t let garlic burn—watch for fragrant aroma, only 30 seconds max."
- "Add shrimp scattered in single layer. Let them sear on one side until pink and opaque edges appear. Flip and cook other side, about 2-3 minutes total. Fish can get rubbery if overcooked."
- "Turn off heat. Sprinkle lemon zest and parsley. Season with black pepper and adjust salt. Toss in pasta with reserved cooking water to loosen sauce; you want coating, not swimming."
- "Serve promptly. Optional drizzle extra olive oil top. No parmesan here—won’t match the seafood flavor. The brightness from lemon zest is everything."
introduction: "Shrimp and fennel dance in olive oil, the garlic sizzling just right, tossed with long ribbons of tagliatelle. No butter, no cream. Briny sweetness from seafood meets anise whisper from fennel. Learn the signs—how fennel softens but still holds shape, how garlic unleashes fragrance before bitterness. Sharp lemon zest cuts through richness without dairy. Stay alert for shrimp’s translucent shift; overcook and you lose tender snap and yield chewy disappointment. Substitute scallops if shrimp unavailable. Celery can stand in for fennel, just ditch the licorice notes. Minimal ingredients, maximal flavor. You’ll want this on loop for any weeknight hustle. No fuss. Just culinary sense."
ingredientsNote: "Shrimp choice matters—wild-caught if you can get them, de-vein and peel for no surprises later. Frozen works fine, just thaw thoroughly and pat dry to avoid steaming rather than searing. Fennel adds unique licorice note; if that intimidates use celery slices but lose distinct aroma. Garlic is key flavor driver here but burnt garlic means burnt taste—keep a close ear and nose to that pan. Lemon zest, not juice, maintains light aroma without soggy acid splash. Vegetable broth for steaming fennel builds flavor; water with a sprinkle of bouillon can substitute if stock unavailable. Dry white wine optional but adds gentle tang and lifts sauce complexity."
instructionsNote: "Keep the pan hot but controlled. Medium heat for shallots and fennel prevents premature burning; flick water drops to monitor temperature—should evaporate briskly but not burst into spatters. Covering fennel traps steam, softens edges before you get that first golden caramel. Garlic is a timing finesse—add too early and it burns; toss in last minute, watch quick perfume pop, then shrimp immediately after. Shrimp needs complete contact with pan surface for uniform color; crowding pan leads to steaming instead of sear. When adding pasta back, use reserved water in small increments to get sauce consistency right without watery sludge. Toss fast but gentle—breakage ruins presentation. Serve fast before flavors dull and textures degrade."
tips:
- "Watch that garlic; sautéed perfect smells lovely. Too long turns bitter. Last minute crush for best aroma. Add shrimp right after, keep things moving."
- "Fennel can overwhelm. Slice thin, not chunks. Caramelization is key. Add salt to draw moisture. Watch for soft but not mushy. Texture matters."
- "Cooking pasta al dente is crucial. Time it right; set a timer for one minute less than package says. Texture should hold against shrimp but still gentle."
- "Substitutes? Scallops work if shrimp’s missing. Celery can stand for fennel if mild flavor needed. Watch the texture—check cook time."
- "Reserve cooking water; add splashes. Consistency check; not too thick or watery. Toss fast with gentle motions to avoid breakage. Keep it elegant."
faq:
- "q: How to know shrimp is cooked? a: Look for pink color. Opaque edges signal ready. Too long makes rubbery. Timing is everything."
- "q: Can I use frozen shrimp? a: Sure, but thaw well. Pat dry to avoid steaming. Important to sear not steam. Texture won’t be right otherwise."
- "q: What if fennel is too strong? a: Slice thinner or opt for celery. Less anise flavor but lacks distinct taste. Adjust per preference."
- "q: Storage tips for leftovers? a: Store in airtight container. I recommend in fridge for two days max. Reheat gently; use low heat to prevent toughness."
