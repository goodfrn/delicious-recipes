slug: "peanut-butter-brownies"
description: "Rich chocolate brownies with swirls of peanut butter and a creamy white chocolate topping. Adjusted flour and sugar quantities, replaced white chocolate with cream cheese in frosting, and swapped salted peanuts for pretzel bits for crunch. Baked slightly longer at a lower temperature for a fudgier texture. Uses a condensed milk-based batter, combined with peanut butter and cocoa powder, then layered with a creamy, tangy topping. Finished with a caramel drizzle and crunchy salted pretzels. Moist, dense, with sweet and salty contrasts and a thick, marbled look. Makes nine squares, stores well at room temperature for a week."

- "2. Whisk flour, cocoa powder, and baking powder in a bowl. Set aside."
- "3. Set a heatproof bowl over simmering water (bain-marie). Add dark chocolate, butter, peanut butter, and half the condensed milk (125 ml). Stir just till melted and uniform. Remove from heat."
- "4. Whisk brown sugar and eggs into chocolate mixture quickly. Fold dry ingredients gently with spatula until incorporated."

- "7. Spoon topping evenly over brownie batter in pan."
- "8. Dollop remaining batter over topping. Use spatula or knife to swirl layers lightly, creating a marbled effect."
- "9. Sprinkle crushed pretzels evenly on top for crunch."
- "10. Bake about 55 minutes. Test with toothpick: should come out with moist crumbs, not clean."

introduction: "Dense chocolate base. Swirled with peanut butter but creamy, tangy cream cheese mix this time. Melted dark chocolate with softened butter and peanut butter, moves into the rich condensed milk and sugar beaten with eggs. Flour and cocoa lodge in to thicken, not too dry, a fudgy texture underneath. A topping thick yet smooth to balance. Pretzel crunch replacing salted peanuts for unexpected salty twist. Caramel sauce splash on serving, optional but adds depth. Bakes slowly at 320°F instead of 325°F. A touch longer, keeps the middle molten, edges set but soft. Cut into nine squares, rich enough in small bites. Holds a week in airtight, no fridge stalking needed. Tang and sweet, saltiness, chew and softness. Dessert chaos, but right proportions."
ingredientsNote: "Reduced flour slightly to keep moist. Less brown sugar; caramel notes from salted caramel sauce replace some sweetness. Cocoa powder lowered to match chocolate amount, keeping bitterness balanced. Using 250 ml sweetened condensed milk total, split for batter and topping, keeps creamy consistency. Butter measured down to avoid greasy feel; peanut butter full fat, natural smooth recommended. Cream cheese topping replaces white chocolate and extra peanut butter—adds tang and thick texture. Salted pretzels crushed in place of salted peanuts add crunch with saltiness and brittle contrast. All measured in grams and ml for precision, cups in parentheses."
instructionsNote: "The batter starts with melting dark chocolate, butter, peanut butter, and half the condensed milk over gentle heat, careful not to scorch. Immediately add sugar and eggs, whisk briskly for air. Flour mixture folded gently to avoid toughness. Half poured into pan. Topping mixed last with cream cheese replacing original white chocolate, stirring until just smooth without lumps. Topping spread evenly. Remaining batter dolloped and gently swirled with topping—don't overmix. Pretzels sprinkled; gives salty crunch after baking. Bake at a slightly reduced temperature for a bit longer than original for that gooey center. Toothpick testing important: should come out with moist crumbs but not wet batter. Cool fully before cutting to prevent collapse. Store in airtight, caramel drizzle optional but encouraged to boost salty-sweet layers."
tips:
- "Use natural smooth peanut butter. This makes it easier to mix. Do not use low-fat or reduced-fat products. It will change the texture. Drier brownies will result. Choose the right type for best flavor."
- "Be careful when melting chocolate. Use a bain-marie for gentle heat. This helps avoid scorching. Stir often to keep it smooth. Mix with butter and peanut butter right away. Should be uniform. Remove from heat promptly."
- "Testing for doneness is key. Toothpick should come out with moist crumbs, not clean. Avoid pulling too soon. The center needs time to set. Cool completely before cutting to prevent collapse. Important for presentation."
- "Swirled batter needs gentle folding. Avoid overmixing. Keep that marbled look. Top layer should not be fully blended. Pretzel bits on top need attention. They add crunch. Sprinkle evenly for best texture and taste. Don't skip this."
- "If you want more saltiness, consider adding sea salt on top. Optional but enhances flavors. More contrast with sweet and salty. Also, think about the storage. Airtight container at room temp is best. Maintain freshness."
faq:
- "q: What if I want to change the nut butter? a: Almond or cashew butter can work. Texture may vary. Check consistency. Start with similar ratios. Always use smooth, not chunky. Experiment with flavors."
- "q: Can I use a different sweetener? a: Yes, alternatives exist. Honey or maple syrup modify the taste. Could add more moisture. Adjust dried ingredients accordingly. Keep proportions in mind. Not too much liquid."
- "q: How do I prevent sogginess? a: Baking longer might be necessary. Oven temperature plays a role too. Make sure to preheat correctly. Test doneness as directed. Cooling properly is important to solidify."
- "q: What are the best ways to store? a: An airtight container is best. Room temperature is fine for a week. Refrigeration is not necessary. Though it can alter texture slightly. Be cautious about humidity."
