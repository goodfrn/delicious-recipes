ingredients:
- "2 cups all-purpose flour"
- "1 tsp baking powder"
- "1 tsp baking soda"
- "8 tbsp unsalted butter softened"
- "1 cup granulated sugar"
- "3 large egg whites room temp"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1/2 tsp almond extract"
- "1/2 cup whole milk"
- "1/3 cup cherry juice 100% natural"
- "1-2 drops red gel food coloring"
- "1 cup canned cherry pie filling"
- "5 tbsp coconut oil solid but scoopable"
- "3/4 cup powdered sugar sifted"
- "2-3 tbsp half and half"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1/2 tsp almond extract"
- "1 tbsp cherry juice"
- "18 fresh cherries with stems"
instructions:
- "=== Cupcakes ==="
- "Preheat oven to 345F. Line cupcake tins with papers and set aside. Lower temp slightly to keep crust tender but firm."
- "Whisk flour, baking powder and baking soda in a small bowl. Set dry mix aside to keep leaveners even."
- "Beat butter and sugar with medium-high mixer speed until fluffy and pale. About 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Don’t overbeat or batter turns greasy. Stop once texture looks light and volume slightly increased."
- "Drop mixer speed to low-medium and add egg whites gradually. Mix just enough to combine eggs evenly; no need to fluff vigorous here."
- "Pour in vanilla and almond extract. Almond adds subtle depth- skip for none but doesn’t overpower."
- "Add flour mixture alternately with milk and cherry juice, starting and ending with flour. Keep mixing minimal after flour addition to avoid dense crumb."
- "Drop in 1–2 drops of gel red coloring to even out naturally dull cherry tone."
- "Fill liners about two-thirds full. Visual cue: batter should mound slightly but flow slowly when scooped. Avoid overfilling - batter will rise."
- "Bake 17 to 20 minutes until edges lightly brown and toothpick inserted near center comes out with moist crumbs, not wet batter. Oven varies, watch for dome setting and spring-back when pressed."
- "Cool cupcakes completely on wire rack before coring. Hot cupcakes break apart."
- "Using a cupcake corer or small sharp knife, hollow out center carefully. Save core tops for sealing."
- "Place half cherry pie filling in piping bag (or Ziploc with corner cut). Insert tip into cavity and squeeze filling slowly to avoid bursting the cupcake. Fill but don’t overstuff."
- "Replace cupcake top snugly and set cupcakes aside."
- "=== Cherry Frosting ==="
- "Beat room-temp butter and coconut oil on medium-high speed for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes until creamy and combined. Coconut oil replaces shortening, imparts slight tropical note and softer texture."
- "Lower speed to low and add powdered sugar gradually 1/2 cup at a time alternating with half and half. Avoid sugar clouds by mixing slow before speeding up. Beat until fully integrated and fluffy at medium speed."
- "Add cherry juice, vanilla, and almond extract, continue mixing until frosting smooth and spreadable but firm enough to hold shape."
- "Fill piping bag fitted with star tip or a large Ziploc with snipped corner."
- "Hold piping tip about half inch above cupcake. Squeeze evenly to form a star center, then circle outward following star shape. Keep frosting layers thin-ish to prevent collapse."
- "Top each cupcake with fresh cherry stem side up for visual punch and easy grabbing."
- "Serve room temperature within a few hours or chill briefly before serving but allow to warm slightly for best mouthfeel."
introduction: "Cherry and almond carry a classic duet. Juicy cherry juice and pie filling fold into batter weighing just right for moist crumb without collapse. Butter and coconut oil combo in frosting cut artificiality of shortening, yield a piping consistency that holds shape but softens pleasingly on tongue. Baking a shade lower allows cupcakes to stay tender—tests toothpick and slight dome resists sticky crumbs. Core cupcakes to hide the surprise fruit, a technique needing patience and the right tool: a corer or trimmed knife works. Decorating isn’t rocket science but key is steady hand and full bags and you avoid frosting blobs. Cherry on top is not optional here. Bright ruby juice, mild almond, and final fruit unison. No fluff, just know-how."
ingredientsNote: "Flour should be gently spooned and leveled for accuracy. Butter and coconut oil must be soft but not melted—too warm, batter separates; too cold batter won’t cream properly. Egg whites bring lift but no yolks here to avoid density—room temp whites whip smoother. Cherry juice used here is pure no sugar added to keep sweet balance; canned pie filling supplies texture and concentrated fruit burst but pick one with whole cherries. Vanilla and almond extracts carry the flavor backbone; swap almond for a splash of amaretto if handy. Milk may be substituted for almond or oat milk for dairy-free options, flavor shifts slightly. Food coloring optional, just 1–2 drops avoid unnatural hues."
instructionsNote: "Creaming butter and sugar traps air, leading to lighter cakes—overbeat past peaks and batter can separate, showing greasy sheen. Incorporate eggs at lower speed to keep texture fine. When adding dry and wet ingredients alternately, mix until just combined to avoid tough cupcakes. Baking times can vary—look for pale golden edges and center with wobble disappearing but slight spring-back to finger pressure. Cupcakes cool fully before coring to avoid crumble. A cupcake corer drills neat holes with less mess—otherwise use a small, sharp serrated knife, twisting gently. Filling too much and fast bursts the cupcake. Frosting needs sugar added slowly; increasing speed midway ensures proper aeration. Keep piping bags firm but not overstuffed for control. Hold tip steady and at consistent height; varied pressure and speed causes uneven swirls."
tips:
- "For fluffy cupcakes, cream butter and sugar till pale but don’t overbeat. Can separate, become greasy. Sift flour before using for better texture—no lumps."
- "Egg whites add lift. Use large eggs at room temperature. Cold whites may not whip well. Makes a light crumb. Alternating dry and wet ingredients? Do it gently."
- "Use a corer but if no corer, a sharp knife works too. Drill holes carefully. Save tops. Fill cavities slowly, avoid bursting. Let cupcakes cool completely before core."
- "When frosting, pipe steady, half an inch above cupcake. Start center, swirl outwards. Mix sugar slowly into butter. Avoid sugar clouds. Keep control of the piping bag."
- "Cherry juice used here should be pure, no sugar added. Baking at 345F helps retain moisture. Look for golden edges, slight dome. Center should have slight spring-back."
faq:
- "q: How to ensure my cupcakes bake evenly? a: Start with preheated oven. Rotate halfway through baking. Check for dome and spring-back."
- "q: Can I make these cupcakes dairy-free? a: Substitute regular milk with almond or oat milk. Cherry juice still keeps sweetness balanced."
- "q: What to do if cupcakes sink in the middle? a: Ensure proper mixing—overmixing leads to heavy texture. Use room temp egg whites for lift."
- "q: How to store leftover cupcakes? a: Store in airtight container. Room temperature okay for up to 2 days. Can refrigerate if necessary, but flavor changes."
