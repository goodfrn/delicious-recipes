Shiitake mushrooms replace the original coffee mushrooms, roasted until caramelized to bring earthiness. Creamy cashew milk swapped for soya to add richness and balance. Aromatic lemon zest with chives and fresh peas fold in at the end. Crisp arugula salad tossed with lemon juice and olive oil tops the dish, finished with vegan Parmesan for umami punch.

ingredients:
- "600 ml vegetable or mushroom broth"
- "250 ml creamy cashew milk"
- "1 thyme sprig"
- "1 garlic clove, minced"
- "225 g fresh shiitake mushrooms, sliced"
- "30 ml olive oil, plus extra for serving"
- "1 medium onion, diced"
- "150 g quinoa, rinsed and drained"
- "80 ml dry white wine"
- "200 g frozen peas, thawed"
- "30 ml finely chopped chives"
- "1 lemon, zested"
- "25 g arugula"
- "5 ml lemon juice"
- "Vegan Parmesan substitute, to taste"
- "Optional twist: pinch smoked paprika"
instructions:
- "Heat broth, cashew milk, thyme, and garlic together in a small saucepan over low heat. Salt and pepper it slightly. Watch for small bubbles and steam rising, not a full boil. Keeps ingredients melded and warm for pour-over later."
- "Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a medium sauté pan over medium. When shimmering, toss in shiitake slices. Let them sit undisturbed about 4–5 minutes until a golden crust forms before stirring. Avoid crowding to ensure caramelization, sounds will stop when done. Add diced onion, cook 3 minutes until translucent and soft, no browning."
- "Quickly stir in quinoa, toast 1 to 2 minutes. The grains should glisten, fragrant, not burnt. Pour in wine, cook until nearly all evaporated, watching for the subtle sizzle to stop. This seals in flavor and preps quinoa for broth."
- "Remove thyme sprig from broth mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add about a cup of broth gradually to quinoa mix. Stir often but gently, allowing broth to absorb fully before adding next ladle to coax starch out, achieving creaminess without stirring nonstop. Expect 25 to 30 minutes total cooking. Add more broth if needed, quinoa texture should be tender but with a bite, like risotto."
- "Five minutes before done, stir in peas, chives, and zest. This preserves the brightness and crunch of peas, keeps herbs fresh."
- "Combine arugula, lemon juice, a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl with a drizzle of olive oil. Taste balance — lemon cuts bitterness in arugula."
- "Serve quinoa mixture topped with dressed arugula and sprinkle with vegan Parmesan or nutritional yeast. A hint of smoked paprika at plating adds unexpected warmth and depth. Drizzle extra olive oil around for silkiness."
- "Pro tips: Don’t rush liquid absorption; hot broth prevents breaks in cooking. Toast quinoa first for nuttiness. Watch mushroom browning closely, under or overcooked ruins texture. Lemon zest and juice added late keeps brightness fresh, avoid overcooking herbs."
introduction: "Creamy grain dishes aren’t just for rice. Quinoa can be coaxed into that rich, velvety territory where every bite shines with textures and flavors layered in. Swapping coffee mushrooms for shiitakes amps earthiness and a meatier chew. Cashew milk adds silkiness without overpowering like some soy creams. The slow addition of broth—key here—extracts starch while letting flavors mingle without the grains breaking down into mush. Smoked paprika sneaks in as a subtle surprise. The bright lemon zest and crisp fresh peas keep the palate lively. A simple arugula salad dressed with lemon juice and oil adds peppery crunch and lifts the whole dish. You’re working with patience and paying close attention to textures and aromas. Toast grains first, cook mushrooms undisturbed until golden, stir just enough for creamy but intact quinoa. Timing and sensation rule. This is quinotto, that is, risotto but more vibrant and plant-powered."
ingredientsNote: "Broth choice affects final taste—a rich mushroom broth adds umami depth, vegetable broth keeps it lighter. Cashew milk was chosen for creaminess—coconut milk is an alternate if tolerated, but watch sweetness. Shiitake mushrooms deliver a robust meaty note, but any firm mushroom like cremini or portobello can work—adjust cooking time slightly for moisture content. Diced onion softens the base aromas. Wine adds acidity and fragrance; if skipped, a splash of lemon juice in cooking helps. Fresh or thawed frozen peas offer color and pop; raw peas would cook too fast. Chives and lemon zest are last-minute additions for brightness. Vegan Parmesan or nutritional yeast fits for finishing, but toasted breadcrumbs also add crunch. Olive oil quality matters—use a fruity, fresh one to finish."
instructionsNote: "Warm broth mixture gently—no boil, or the cream might separate. Removing thyme sprig before cooking stops bitter over-extraction. Sautéing mushrooms without crowding is crucial; don’t stir too often—let surfaces brown or you lose flavor development and texture. Toasting quinoa is quick, keep stirring to avoid burning. When adding broth, the key is that sizzle and absorption before a new ladle; you want creamy but nutty grains, not mush. Stir often but gently to coax starch without crushing grains. Peas, herbs, zest go in last so they keep vibrancy and texture. Salad dressing: toss just before serving to keep arugula bright and crisp. Final drizzle of olive oil ties it all together. Avoid overcooking or the dish turns gluey. If in doubt, taste grain firmness and texture—should have slight chew still. Adjust seasoning at end, the vegan Parmesan adds salt and umami punch."
tips:
- "Watch liquid absorption—slow pouring is key. Broth steaming, not boiling. Texture signals readiness. Quinoa should absorb, not turn mushy. Bit-by-bit, coax starch."
- "Mushroom browning crucial—don’t stir often; let heat create crust. About 4–5 minutes undisturbed, then flip. Gold is flavor. Use high-quality mushrooms, shiitake preferred."
- "For creamy grains—toast quinoa first. Easy to burn, keep stirring briefly. You want a warm nuttiness, aromas blooming. Watch how it glistens; adjust heat as needed."
- "Add peas and herbs late. Preserve brightness and crunch. If added too early, vibrant flavors fade. Chives cut through richness. Experiment with herbs you have."
- "Salad dressing impacts dish—add lemon and oil just before serving. Brightness counters richness of quinoa. Adjust salt here too; remember Parmesan adds umami."
faq:
- "q: How to choose broth? a: Veggie broth is lighter, mushroom broth offers umami. Richer flavor with mushrooms. Always simmer gently before adding."
- "q: What if quinoa is mushy? a: Slow liquid addition is key. Test around 25 minutes. If mush occurs, less stirring next time. Maybe reduce broth volume."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container, max three days. Reheat gently, add a splash of broth or water. Keeps grains intact."
- "q: Substitute for cashew milk? a: Use almond or coconut milk if available. Watch sweetness levels—coconut might alter taste. Best for creaminess."
