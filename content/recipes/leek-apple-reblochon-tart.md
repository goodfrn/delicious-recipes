slug: "leek-apple-reblochon-tart"
description: "A savoury tart stacking earthy leeks with crisp apples and creamy Reblochon cheese instead of camembert. Puff pastry frames the filling for a flaky base. Toasted walnuts swap pignons for nuttier crunch. Honey adds a floral glaze as it caramelizes in the oven. A hint of fresh thyme tucked in with the fruit gives subtle herbaceous notes. Cook leeks till just tender—not mushy—maintain a gentle bite. Visual: edges puff and brown, cheese bubbles and browns slightly. Serve warm or room temp. Six servings, moderate effort, approachable for weekday or dinner party starters."

ingredients:
- "1 sheet puff pastry approx 225 g"
- "3 small leeks around 240 g total"
- "15 ml olive oil"
- "125 g Reblochon cheese sliced thin"
- "2 medium apples peeled cored sliced thin"
- "15 ml honey"
- "30 ml toasted walnuts roughly chopped"
- "1 tsp fresh thyme leaves"
- "Salt and fresh cracked black pepper"
instructions:
- "Set oven rack low. Preheat to 185 C 365 F. Line a baking tray with parchment."
- "Roll puff pastry to a 26 cm disc, little bigger than original. Fold edges under to form a thick rim. Refrigerate 25-30 mins to relax dough."
- "Trim leeks keeping roots intact. Slice lengthwise halfway up then rinse thoroughly to remove grit. Boil salted water. Blanch leeks 6-7 mins until tender but still firm. Chill quickly in iced water to halt cooking. Drain and pat dry."
- "Pat dough surface with fork, avoid piercing rim. Brush olive oil all over dough base and sides. Lay slices of Reblochon evenly, not crowded but full coverage."
- "Arrange leeks radiating from center in star shape, leave gaps between. Insert apple slices in gaps, sprinkle fresh thyme evenly."
- "Drizzle honey in thin threads over fruit and cheese. Scatter toasted walnuts on top, press lightly so they stick."
- "Season with salt and freshly cracked black pepper; do so sparingly to avoid overpowering cheese and apples."
- "Bake in preheated oven 40-45 mins. Watch crust puff color to golden brown, cheese bubbly and starting to brown edges. Apples should be softened but retain shape and slight firmness."
- "Remove tart from oven. Cool 10 mins on rack before slicing to avoid tears. Serve warm or room temperature as an appetizer or light lunch with salad."
- "Leftover tart reheats well under grill or warm oven for 5 mins to restore crispiness."
introduction: "Leeks tender, not mushy. Apples crisp but softened. Camembert swapped for Reblochon, creamier, less tang. Puff pastry rolled thinner, chilled, so it holds shape, puffs beautifully. Honey drizzled just before baking caramelizes to sweet gloss, nuts swap from pine to toasted walnuts for robust crunch and nuttiness. Fresh thyme sneaks in subtle herb note, not overbearing. Bake low, rack lowered, edges puff golden, cheese bubbles and browns faintly. Aromas rich, layers visible. Serve warm or room temp. Rustic yet refined. Easy but precise. A tart that proves attention to detail matters."
ingredientsNote: "Store-bought puff pastry is a timesaver but thaw well—too cold and it breaks, too warm and it’s sticky. Reblochon swaps nicely for camembert; creamy, melt well, mild rind flavour. Use firm apples like Pink Lady or Granny Smith to keep texture distinct, avoid mush. Leeks need washing—sand gets into layers easily, triple rinse if needed. Honey should be floral but subtle—buckwheat or strong monoflorals overpower. Walnuts give earthiness, swap for pecans if preferred. Fresh thyme essential—dried gives bitter, dusty notes. Olive oil brushed on dough prevents soggy bottoms, adds colour. Season after assembly since cheese and nuts add salt themselves—over salting kills balance."
instructionsNote: "Chill pastry well after shaping; hot dough shrinks, loses edge height. Dock base only so crust puffs evenly without blistering the edges. Boil salted water for leeks—a little salt seasons and helps texture. Blanch until just tender, ice shock immediately maintains colour and firmness. Layer ingredients thoughtfully—the star-shaped leeks give geometry, apples fill gaps to balance sweetness and acidity. Drizzle honey gently to prevent pooling; nuts press lightly so they toast but don’t fall off. Bake on low rack to avoid burning cheese before crust crisps. Visual cues: golden amber crust, cheese bubbling with slight browning at edges, apples softened. Rest briefly before cutting to prevent tearing and soggy crust. Reheat in warm oven to revive crispness; microwaves ruin texture."
tips:
- "Chill pastry well after rolling, keep edges thick. Hot dough shrinks. Pat down base with a fork; don’t pierce edges. Watch for puffing and browning."
- "Blanch leeks until tender yet firm—6-7 minutes max. Ice bath immediately after, brightens color. Slice visually; radiate for presentation."
- "Use firm apples—Granny Smith or Pink Lady. They hold shape better. Avoid mushiness in the filling. Slice thinly for even cooking."
- "Honey drizzled before baking caramelizes nicely but can burn if too close to edges. Spread it lightly. Nuts add crunch—don’t skip."
- "Fresh thyme is a must; dried versions overwhelm flavors. Sprinkle evenly over filling, avoid clumping. Imperative to adjust salt levels."
faq:
- "q: What if my leeks are mushy? a: Cook less; blanch only until just tender. Ice bath stops cooking. Keep texture."
- "q: Can I use another cheese? a: Yes, brie works okay but milder taste. Ensure creaminess is still there. Experiment."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. Reheat under grill for crispness; avoid microwaving. Changes texture."
- "q: What’s the best way to prevent soggy bottom? a: Brush olive oil on dough; it helps. Bake low and slow—crust needs time."
