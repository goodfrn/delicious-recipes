description: "Frozen yogurt with a twist on the classic vanilla flavor. Uses coconut sugar and maple syrup instead of white sugar and corn syrup. Added a pinch of cinnamon and lemon zest for an unexpected dash of flavor. The preparation involves blending all ingredients until smooth, then churning until semi-frozen, followed by slow freezing for a dense texture. Makes about one liter, taking a little over half an hour to prepare and chill."

ingredients:
- "525 ml (2 1/4 cups) plain Greek yogurt 5%, cold"
- "85 g (3/8 cup) coconut sugar"
- "50 ml (3 tablespoons + 1 teaspoon) pure maple syrup"
- "1 vanilla bean, seeds scraped"
- "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon"
- "Zest of 1 small lemon"
instructions:
- "1. Combine yogurt, coconut sugar, maple syrup, vanilla seeds, cinnamon, and lemon zest in a blender. Blend until completely smooth and evenly mixed."
- "2. Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker. Churn for about 25 minutes until it thickens but is still soft."
- "3. Transfer frozen yogurt to an airtight container. Freeze for at least 5 hours or until firm."
- "4. Before serving, remove from freezer and let sit 5 to 10 minutes to soften slightly."
- "5. Scoop and serve chilled."
introduction: "Vanilla notes, yes, but different now. Coconut sugar replaces white, maple syrup replaces corn syrup. Cinnamon and lemon zing sneak in. Cold yogurt, sweet tang from maple, warm spice from cinnamon, bright citrus in the background. Mix it, churn it, freeze it. Time folds slowly — start to eat hours later. The texture still creamy, the flavors complex. No eggs, no nuts, naturally gluten free. Perfect for summer when cold is king, yet you'd like a little unexpected. Eat straight or jazz it with berries, nuts, even a drizzle of honey. Keep it simple or go bold, your call. Frozen yogurt, but remixed."
ingredientsNote: "Use Greek yogurt around 5% fat for creaminess. Substituting coconut sugar for regular sugar adds a mild caramel flavor. Maple syrup replaces corn syrup — a little less sweet, but richer taste. Vanilla bean’s seeds bring real vanilla flavor; scraping the pod, don’t skip it. Cinnamon gives a subtle warming note that balances the citrus zest’s brightness. Lemon zest—not juice—adds just the right hint of freshness without watering down. Keep all dairy cold to make churning effective. The sugar and syrups prevent icy crystals, keeping the yogurt creamy while frozen."
instructionsNote: "Start by blending until super smooth, making sure vanilla seeds and spices are well mixed. Using an ice cream maker cuts freezing time compared to just straight freezing. Churn until texture thickens but not frozen solid. Transfer immediately into a sealed container to avoid freezer burn or ice build-up. 5 hours or overnight freezing makes perfect firmness, no rush. Let frozen yogurt temper slightly post-freeze for easier scooping. Stir mid-way through freezing if you want softer texture but skipping it leads to denser. Ideal serving texture is firm but yielding, not rock solid. Keep refrigerated or freeze depending on how soon you serve."
tips:
- "Chill all yogurt before using. Cold helps mixture blend better. Ice cream maker is key, but even blending works. If blender only, freeze longer. Texture gets tricky though."
- "Watch blending closely. Everything must be smooth. No lumps allowed. Check spices too. Mix well with yogurt. Scraping vanilla beans is a must for real flavor kick. Don't skip it or you'll lose richness."
- "Freezing time is flexible. Long freeze makes it dense but firm. Shorter time keeps it softer. Perfect firmness is more about preference. Mix ingredients well. If too sweet for you, adjust sweeteners down too."
- "Use airtight container for freezing. Avoid ice crystals forming. Helps keep creamy texture intact. Want a quick serve? Let it sit out before scooping. Expect it to soften a bit before enjoying cold treat."
- "Coconut sugar brings cool notes and a caramel vibe. Maple syrup is less sweet; adjusts for richness. Remember cinnamon pairs well. Lemon zest is fresh; citrus depth adds zing."
faq:
- "q: Can I use regular sugar? a: Yes but taste changes. Coconut sugar is unique, adds caramel notes. Regular sugar gives sweetness but lacks those flavors."
- "q: How long will it last in the freezer? a: Frozen yogurt keeps for a month or even longer. Use airtight containers for best results. Opened too long, flavors lose intensity."
- "q: Can I use other sweeteners? a: Sure, options abound. Honey works well too. Agave syrup is good alternative if looking for vegan-friendly choice. Adjust sweetness to your liking."
- "q: What if it freezes too hard? a: Let it sit out. 5 to 10 minutes usually helps. To soften faster, stir gently. Break up too solid spots if needed. Want softer texture? Stir during freeze."
