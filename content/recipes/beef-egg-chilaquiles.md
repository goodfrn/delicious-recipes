ingredients:
- "360 ml 1 1/2 cups strained tomato purée"
- "20 ml 1 1/2 tbsp chipotle hot sauce"
- "20 ml zest and juice of 1 lime"
- "4 sandwich steaks about 110 g 4 oz each"
- "30 ml 2 tbsp vegetable oil"
- "4 eggs"
- "480 ml 2 cups parboiled white rice cooked, warm"
- "1 can 540 ml 19 oz refried black beans heated"
- "180 g 5 cups low salt corn tortilla chips"
- "375 ml 1 1/2 cup roasted poblano salsa (sub for tomatillo salsa)"
- "180 ml 3/4 cup crema mexicana or sour cream"
- "50 g 1/3 cup crumbled cotija cheese (instead of queso fresco)"
- "1 small red onion thinly sliced"
- "10 g 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro"
- "1 ripe avocado sliced, for garnish"
instructions:
- "Combine tomato purée, chipotle hot sauce, lime zest and juice in a bowl, whisk well. Reserve; flavor should balance smoky heat and fresh citrus punch."
- "Preheat a heavy skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add half oil; lay steaks flat. Sear hard 1-2 minutes each side until deeply brown crust. Season with salt, pepper mid-cook; remove and tent loosely with foil to rest. Don't crowd pan to avoid steaming meat."
- "Wipe pan clean. Lower heat to medium-low; add remaining oil. Crack eggs carefully, one by one, into pan. Fry eggs sunny side up, whites fully set but yolks still runny, about 3-4 minutes. Watch edges bubble and gently firm up; do not flip. Salt, pepper before serving."
- "On each plate, layer warm rice, spoon heated black beans evenly. Scatter tortilla chips in moderate quantity so they stay crisp yet can absorb sauces partially. Spoon tomato-chipotle lime sauce over chips; drizzle roasted poblano salsa generously next. Dollop crema mexicana in spots; sprinkle cotija cheese liberally; add thin onion slices for sharpness."
- "Slice rested steak thin against the grain. Arrange on top of layered chips and sauces. Gently place fried eggs over steak. Scatter fresh cilantro leaves and avocado slices last. Serve immediately, contrast of hot, creamy, crunchy, fresh."
- "Watch for chips that stay too soggy — adjust amount next time. Overcooked eggs get rubbery; whites should be opaque but tender; yolk a golden pool. Adjust steak cook time for thickness; rare to medium rare recommended for tenderness. If no poblano salsa available, blend mild green chilies with tomatillos, onion, garlic and cilantro."
- "For faster bean prep, use canned whole black beans mashed gently with cumin and garlic powder instead of refried. Step efficiency: sear steaks while sauce mixes; prep onions and avocado while eggs fry."
- "Cleanup tip: soak skillet with residual oil while plating, makes degreasing easier."
introduction: "Start with robust seared steak. The first sizzle should be loud, aggressive—maillard reaction forming crust. Eggs follow low and slow, whites firmed gently, yolks still giving. The tomato purée sauce blends smoky chipotle with zesty lime brightness. Layers in the plate matter: warm rice base, creamy black beans, sharp fresh onion, tangy crema, crumbly cotija cheese. Chips don’t get lost under sauce; just softened enough to meld textures. Instead of plain tomatillo salsa, go roasted poblano for earthier aroma, smoother texture. Avocado slices add creaminess counterpoint. Timing’s flexible; cook steak according to thickness, watch egg whites. The key: contrast in textures, balance in acidic punch and smoky heat. Simple swaps create new flavors while keeping tradition’s bones intact."
ingredientsNote: "Quantities tweaked down by about 20% for a balanced plate that doesn’t overwhelm. Tomato purée replaces coulis for thicker body. Chipotle hot sauce usage trimmed to moderate heat level, lime juice must be fresh for brightness. Replaced store salsa verde with homemade roasted poblano salsa—bake or char poblano peppers, blend with onion and garlic for smoky, milder green salsa. Queso fresco swapped with cotija because it crumbles differently, saltier punch. Crema mexicana preferred for slight tang and velvety texture; sour cream acceptable if unavailable. Corn tortilla chips reduced a bit for better chip to bean and sauce ratio. Avocado added for an optional creamy, buttery balance. Use ripe but firm avocado so doesn’t mush immediately on serving. Common substitutions: steak can be replaced with skirt or flank; if using flank, slice against grain thinly to avoid toughness. Black beans canned convenient; homemade refried needs more time but worth for texture. Rice best parboiled to hold shape and warmth. If no chipotle hot sauce, smoked paprika mix with cayenne can mimic smoky heat."
instructionsNote: "Focus on developing deep sear on steaks— not too thick to avoid undercooked center, not too thin to dry out fast. Pan must be hot enough so meat resists sticking and browns well. Rest steak covered loosely in foil to keep juices. Eggs require low heat; watch closely for whites turning opaque with bubbled edges and no wet uncooked parts. Avoid flipping to maintain runny yolk. Chips added last but mix carefully with warm sauces so they absorb flavor without loss of crunch. Layering order matters for mouthfeel: starchy rice base, protein-rich beans, crunchy chips soaking sauces, drips of cooling crema, salty cheese sprinkle, aromatic onion and herbs for bite. Steak sliced thin maintains tenderness and easy eating. Avocado slices add richness and visual color pop. Timing overlap: prepare sauce while steaks sear; heat beans during egg frying. Adjust cook times ±1-2 minutes depending on heat source and ingredient sizes. Avoid soggy chips by adding sauces and ingredients just before eating. Leftovers cause chips to soften too much, better to serve fresh. If pressed for time, use pre-cooked rice and drained beans to speed process."
tips:
- "Sear steak hard. High heat necessary. Want that crust. Not too thick or thin; find balance. Rest it to keep juices. For doneness, use touch or thermometer."
- "Eggs need low heat to fry right. Whites firm but yolks runny. Watch closely. No flipping, keeps runny. Salt and pepper right before serving for flavor."
- "Layer carefully. Rice on bottom, helps absorb. Beans atop keeps them warm. Chips need to stay crisp. Too much sauce makes mush; drizzle wisely."
- "If beans aren’t right, mash canned. Easy swap. Instant heat up. Or make fresh refried but takes time. Use cumin, garlic powder for depth in flavor."
- "For the sauce, balance chipotle with lime. Reduce chipotle if it’s too spicy. Use fresh lime juice, not bottled. Can use tomatillo if poblano isn’t available."
faq:
- "q: How to know steak is done? a: Press it. Firm but springs back. Use thermometer, 130–135F rare, medium-rare more tender. Cut against grain for best bites."
- "q: Eggs cooking too fast? a: Lower heat. Cook longer. Whites should never be watery. Keep a close eye. Adjust your technique. It takes practice to perfect."
- "q: Chips soggy after plating? a: Add too much sauce to them. Less is more; avoid premixing. Hard chips remain. Layer sauces over chips right before eating."
- "q: What’s the best way to store leftovers? a: Keep everything separate. Tray storage for chips; keep eggs and rest in fridge. Reheat gently. Avoid microwave for eggs."
