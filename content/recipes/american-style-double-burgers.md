- "125 ml (1/2 cup) mayonnaise"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) finely chopped onion"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) Dijon mustard"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) sweet pickle relish"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) finely chopped jalapeño pepper"
- "3 ml (1/2 tsp) brown sugar"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) ketchup"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) white vinegar"
- "Salt and pepper to taste"
- "=== Burgers ==="
- "4 hamburger buns"
- "560 g (1 1/4 lb) lean ground beef"
- "4 slices cheddar cheese"
- "Pickle slices for garnish"
- "Shredded iceberg lettuce"
instructions:
- "=== Sauce ==="
- "1 Mix all sauce ingredients in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and chill at least 20 minutes."
- "=== Burgers ==="
- "2 Heat grill to high. Oil grates well to prevent sticking."
- "3 Slice hamburger buns horizontally halfway through the top bun. Keep pieces intact for layering."
- "4 Form 8 thin patties from beef, using a burger press or flatten between plastic sheets."
- "5 Grill patties 3 1/2 minutes per side until cooked through. Season with salt and pepper during cooking. One minute before done place cheese on 4 patties. Grill buns briefly to toast."
- "6 Spread sauce inside buns. Lay plain beef patties on bottom bun base. Add pickle slices. Place sliced top bun pieces (crumb side down). Add sauce again. Layer lettuce then cheese-topped patties. Cap with bun top."
- "7 Press lightly, serve immediately."
introduction: "Grill set hot, patties thin, quick cooking. No heavy layers. Sauce, mayo mix, a bit of spice from jalapeño, not the usual pickles. Onion chopped fine, mustard swapped in for tang. Meat shaped flat, eight pans, so the grill cooks evenly. Buns sliced halfway, keeps structure but lets you stack better. Cheese melts at end, small assembly dance with layers of meat, sauce, lettuce, more sauce. Simple but layered. The grill time just shy of usual, little less than 17 minutes for all. Burger stack with some zip and tang, no fuss. Eat messy or neat, your call. Classic meet new, buns soft and warm, toppings cold and crisp. "
ingredientsNote: "Mayonnaise forms base for the sauce but reduced slightly to accommodate stronger Dijon mustard for tang. Onion chopped finely releases flavor into sauce smoothly without chunks. Jalapeño offers mild heat, balancing against sweetness of relish and sugar, replacing some crunch and acidity from original pickles. Brown sugar moderated to avoid overpowering sweet. Ground beef leaner, a bit lighter, shaping thin patties allows fast grilling, less fat drip but keeps juiciness. Buns sliced halfway for layering double beef with sauce between, mimicking Big Mac style but easier handling. Cheese changed to cheddar for sharper bite. Sauce chills to marry flavors well before assembly."
instructionsNote: "Prepare sauce first — essential to chill so flavors blend. Grill preheated oil strong, keeps thin patties from sticking. Buns sliced horizontally only at top for layered effect, not fully halved, prevents buns from falling apart. Flatten patties thin, uniform size means even cook. Grill patties on hot grates 3½ minutes per side, timed closely to hold shape and moisture. Place cheese last minute so it melts but doesn't burn. Toast buns lightly, just enough for texture. Assembly in stages: base bun, sauce, plain patty, pickles, half-top bun piece, sauce again, lettuce, cheese patty, final top bun. Press slightly to compress layers and make eating easier."
tips:
- "Chill sauce well. Mix mayo, onion, mustard, and jalapeño. Blend flavors together for more depth. Let sit minimum 20 minutes. Marry tastes. Avoid rushing this step. Sauce brings a punch."
- "Grill patties on high heat. This key step keeps moisture locked inside. Season with salt and pepper each side. Keep timing close. Thin cooks fast, almost 3½ minutes each side. Watch closely."
- "Split buns halfway. This lets you stack with ease. Don’t cut all the way through. Makes for better structure. Keeps ingredients in. Tasty layers must hold together."
- "Use lean ground beef, about 80/20 ratio. This keeps burgers lighter. Thinner patties cook faster. Less fat drips, but maintain juiciness. Make sure patties are uniform size."
- "Toasting buns? Quick step to add texture. Just a light grill, not too long. You don't want them too crispy or burnt. It’s all about balance."
- "Layer carefully when assembling. Start with sauce on buns. Then steak and pickles. Create that little sandwich art. Keeps everything inside and flavors meld well. Final touch? Press gently."
faq:
- "q: How to adjust cooking time? a: Cook time varies. Thinner means faster. Around 7 minutes total. Or until internal temp hits 160F. Monitor grill closely."
- "q: Can I make these burgers ahead? a: Yes, but keep them in fridge. Cook patties same day. Assemble just before serving. Sauce stored well. Just mix before use."
- "q: What if I don't have jalapeños? a: No problem, use regular pickles instead. Mild flavor missing but still tasty. Or try other peppers for something different."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Place in airtight container. Separate patties and buns. They last 3 days max in fridge. Reheat gently, or grill again."
