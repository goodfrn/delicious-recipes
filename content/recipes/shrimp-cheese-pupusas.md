ingredients:
- "=== Filling ==="
- "4 garlic cloves minced fine"
- "1 small white onion diced small"
- "30 ml vegetable oil"
- "300 g raw peeled shrimp chopped roughly and patted dry"
- "3 scallions chopped"
- "1 fresh serrano chile minced fine (optional seeds for heat)"
- "150 g Monterey Jack cheese shredded fine"
- "=== Dough ==="
- "330 g masa harina (corn flour)"
- "600 ml warm water"
- "6 ml salt"
- "100 ml vegetable oil"
instructions:
- "=== Filling ==="
- "1. Heat oil in skillet over medium-high. Toss in garlic and white onion, stirring often. When fragrant and just starting to color, about 2 minutes, add shrimp, scallions, and serrano chile. Listen for shrimp popping into pink, around 4 minutes. Stir frequently to avoid sticking. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat once shrimp opaque, let cool 10 minutes uncovered; this dries filling slightly."
- "2. Incorporate shredded Monterey Jack into cooled shrimp mix with wooden spoon until mixture thickens and holds together more like a paste. Chill filling while working on dough."
- "=== Dough ==="
- "3. Combine masa harina, salt in bowl. Gradually add warm water, mixing with a wooden spoon until uniform. Squeeze dough with hand, knead 2-3 minutes until soft but not sticky. If dough cracks when pressed, add a splash more water. Let rest covered 10 minutes to hydrate fully."
- "4. Divide dough into 10 equal balls about fist-sized. Lightly oil hands. Flatten each ball to 3 inch (7 cm) disc. Place 2 tablespoons filling in center. Gather edges, pinch firmly to seal like pouch. Re-flatten gently between palms keeping filling inside, shaping discs roughly 3.5 inch (9 cm). Avoid tears - wet fingers help seal."
- "5. Heat large nonstick pan over medium. Add 20 ml oil, swirl. Cook 3-4 pupusas at a time, about 3 minutes each side. Watch for golden-brown spots and fragrant corn aroma as indicator to flip. Use spatula to ease under and flip carefully so they don’t burst open. If dough is tough, reduce oil or water ratio next time."
- "6. Drain on paper towels. Keep warm stacked covered in clean kitchen towel."
- "7. Serve with tart curtido slaw (cabbage, carrot, vinegar) and bright tomato salsa roja for contrast. Leftovers freeze uncooked in airtight container; thaw then cook as above."
introduction: "Don’t underestimate pugusas; they’re deceptively simple but mastering the dough-filling balance is key. The dough must be soft yet firm enough to hold filling without cracking. Masa harina is a non-negotiable base providing authentic texture, slightly gritty but tender after cooking. Shrimp brings briny bite, layered with toasted garlic and sharp onion aromas. Fresh chile adds brightness and a subtle kick that awakens the palate before richness of melted cheese. You want that cheese stringiness but not so much moisture it ruins dough texture. The cooking technique - moderate heat with oil to brown but not burn - creates crisp exterior, steamy interior pockets. This recipe ups the ante with Monterey Jack replacing mozzarella, denser and mellow, an easy swap if mozzarella isn’t handy. Serrano chile stands in for jalapeño, hotter but with citrus notes. Timing isn’t rigid; feel for shrimp turning pink and dough yielding to touch. Best eaten immediately but freezes well pre-cooking for meal prep. Pair with acidic sides to cut through richness, balancing each bite."
ingredientsNote: "Masa harina is preferable over regular cornmeal — it hydrates differently and gives that classic chewy interior. If unavailable, nixtamalized corn flour is acceptable but moisture ratios may vary; adjust water incrementally to avoid crumbly dough. Shrimp texture hinges on removing excess liquid post-chop; pat dry thoroughly or filling becomes soggy, dough breaks. Oil plays dual roles—used in dough for pliability, also in pan for crisping. Too much oil makes pupusas greasy; too little and they’ll stick or cook unevenly. Serrano chile supplies sharp heat and citrusy undertones but can be swapped for jalapeño for milder flavor. Cheese: Monterey Jack preferred over mozzarella for melt with flavor kick; use Chihuahua cheese or young cheddar if you want more punch or local twist. Scallions add fresh mild onion aroma, enhancing shrimp without overpowering."
instructionsNote: "Pan temperature critical. Medium heat varnishes pupusas golden without burning dough edges; test one first. Flip carefully using non-metal spatula to preserve casing integrity; broken pouches spoil the eating experience. Dough resting hydrated, settled, is easier to shape and avoids cracking. Wet fingers sealing dough edges is essential technique—dry hands make pinching brittle, cracks ensue. Filling cooked fully before assembly; raw shrimp ruins texture and can leak moisture. Incorporate cheese after cooling filling—too hot melts cheese into runny mess, impacting dough consistency. Serving: warm pupusas—fluffy, crispy, cheesy, spicy—balanced by acidic curtido or salsa roja sharpness for textural and taste contrast. Leftover dough stores wrapped in fridge up to a day; if it toughens, soften with few drops of warm water, knead lightly. For freezing, shape but do not cook; freeze flat between parchment to separate, thaw overnight, cook as usual."
tips:
- "Keeping shrimp dry is crucial. Pat them well after chopping. Soggy filling ruins dough. Avoid extra moisture. Experiment with fresh herbs. "
- "For the dough, always start with masa harina. Regular cornmeal won't do. Adjust water based on humidity. If it cracks while shaping, add drops. "
- "Oil in pan is vital. Too much will make pupusas greasy. Not enough? They might stick or burn. Use a non-stick pan to minimize issues."
- "Watch for browning spots as cooking indicators. Each side takes about three minutes. Pay attention to smell too. Corn aroma is a signal."
- "Serving them warm is key. Let sit covered to stay soft. Pair with tart slaw; the acidity balances richness. Offer salsas for more flavor."
faq:
- "q: How to prevent dough from cracking? a: Keep dough soft. Knead enough. Adjust water incrementally. Test with a small piece when done."
- "q: What if filling is too runny? a: Chill it before use. Restrict moisture from shrimp; pat dry thoroughly. Incorporate cheese after cooling."
- "q: Common issue with cooking? a: If they’re burning quickly, adjust heat. Medium is best. Cook one first, check results. Too hot? Reduce."
- "q: Can I store leftovers? a: Yes, freeze uncooked pupusas. Separate layers with parchment. For cooked ones, store in fridge up to three days."
