ingredients:
- "7 heirloom tomatoes halved lengthwise"
- "14 petite Yukon gold potatoes, halved"
- "45 ml extra virgin olive oil"
- "salt and freshly cracked black pepper"
- "500 g trimmed green asparagus"
- "250 g shiitake mushrooms, sliced (substitute for pleurotes)"
- "2 cooked lobsters, shelled"
- "flake sea salt"
- "=== LEMON DIJON MAYONNAISE ==="
- "1 large egg yolk"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) Dijon mustard"
- "zest of 1 medium lemon"
- "juice from half a lemon"
- "75 ml grapeseed oil (for neutral flavor)"
- "15 ml chopped fresh tarragon (swap for chives if unavailable)"
instructions:
- "=== ROASTED TOMATOES & POTATOES ==="
- "Set oven rack to middle. Preheat to 165°C (330°F). Line sheet pan with parchment paper."
- "Gently squeeze out excess seeds from tomato halves — prevents watery salad, keeps flesh firm during roasting."
- "In bowl, toss tomatoes, potatoes with half the oil, salt, and pepper. Spread in single layer, cut side down for tomatoes — caramelizes surface. Roast about 55 mins. Potatoes should yield easily with fork but not brown extensively. Aroma changes from raw to sweet, earthy potato smell—watch steam escaping from tomatoes."
- "Remove from oven, keep warm. Tomatoes soften but still hold shape; potatoes slightly creamy inside, skins intact."
- "=== LEMON DIJON MAYONNAISE ==="
- "Whisk egg yolk, Dijon mustard, lemon zest, and lemon juice until smooth and slightly frothy."
- "Slowly drizzle grapeseed oil in steady thin stream, whisk energetically to emulsify. Thickens to creamy consistency, sheen on surface. If too thick, add tiny lemon juice drops to loosen. Fold in tarragon. Season with salt and pepper to taste."
- "Keep chilled till plating. Avoid overheating to prevent breakage; if it splits, whisk in cold water drops."
- "=== GRILLED ASPARAGUS & SHIITAKE MUSHROOMS ==="
- "Preheat BBQ or grill pan to high. Brush asparagus and mushrooms with remaining olive oil, season well."
- "Place asparagus perpendicular to grates to avoid slipping through. Grill 5-6 minutes total, turning periodically so they char lightly but remain crisp-tender. Look for bright green color with slightly blistered skin, a bit of resistance when pierced with fork but no raw crunch."
- "Mushrooms grill about 3 minutes per side until golden with grill marks, juices released but not dried out."
- "Lobster tails sliced thin crosswise, mix claw meat gently torn but keep chunks distinct."
- "=== ASSEMBLY ==="
- "Distribute asparagus, roasted tomatoes, and potatoes evenly onto plates."
- "Arrange lobster meat on top, alternating between tail slices and claw pieces."
- "Scatter grilled mushrooms around for earthiness and texture contrast."
- "Drizzle lemon Dijon mayo over salad in thin ribbons. Finish with crack of black pepper and few flakes of sea salt for bursts of crunch."
- "Serve immediately — textures drop quickly if salad stands too long."
- "=== TIPS & SUBSTITUTES ==="
- "If no BBQ available, use grill pan or broiler with constant watch. Flip mushrooms early as they burn fast."
- "Yukon gold potatoes are ideal for creamy interiors; fingerlings can dry out. Small, uniform pieces ensure even cooking."
- "Shiitake chosen for firm texture and umami depth; cremini mushrooms workable. Pleurotes too delicate for grilling unless careful."
- "Grapeseed oil preferred for neutral taste allowing lemon and tarragon to shine; can use light olive oil but taste will shift."
- "Egg yolk is base for mayonnaise, room temperature helps emulsify better."
- "If avoiding raw egg, swap mayonnaise for store-bought or make aioli with cooked egg yolk powder."
introduction: "Roasting veggies slow, coaxing out natural sugars, a golden cloak on potatoes softening gently without crisp skin is key. Tomatoes lose excess watery seeds to keep salad dry, prevent runny mess. Meanwhile, grill outdoors if you can — smoky notes build depth not possible on stove. Asparagus snapped just right, no fibrous crunch but alive with bite. Mushrooms soak smoky heat, deepen flavor making contrast with tender lobster flesh crucial. Mayo shines here — sharp, zesty, fresh herbs give personality to fat. Don't rush. Watch for colors and texture over timers. Always taste each component alone, then layered. Flaky sea salt hits small bursts of texture, leveraging mouthfeel without overwhelming. You control balance between sweet, citrus, and savory seafood. Real ingredients, simple prep, just timing and technique to finesse."
ingredientsNote: "Tomatoes choose heirlooms for color and sweetness; halving lengthwise exposes more flesh to roasting heat for caramelization but remove seeds to avoid excess moisture. Yukon gold potatoes hold shape while softening, small sizes ensure even roasting. Olive oil split here — half for veggies in oven, half for grilled ones — controls flavor depth. Shiitake instead of pleurotes adds stronger woodsy bite and resists grill better. Lobster pre-cooked and shelled to save grill time, prevents overcooking. Mayonnaise base crucial — fresh egg yolk emulsifies better; lemon juice balances fat with acidity. Grapeseed oil preferred for neutral flavor, allowing lemon and tarragon to stand out. Tarragon replaces chives for anise notes, lift complexity. Salt and crackly pepper finish layers; fleur de sel accentuates textures with delicate crunch, sharp salt bursts. Keep all ingredients at good quality and freshness; each element speaks, minimal fuss but maximum respect for individual flavors. Double-check your grilling oil to prevent flare-ups or burning."
instructionsNote: "Roast tomatoes and potatoes together on parchment to avoid sticking and for easy cleanup; tomatoes placed cut side down caramelize better without drying out, potatoes pick up subtle roasted sweetness without crisp skin — ideal texture contrast. Watch roasting time by fork tenderness on potatoes, not clocks. Mayonnaise requires patience — slowly dribble oil while whisking to build proper emulsion; rushing causes breakage. If split, whisk in cold water in small amounts to bring back together. For grilling asparagus position perpendicular to grates; prevents falling through and even heat exposure. Turn frequently to avoid charring but allow blistering. Mushrooms grill faster; keep an eye and flip early to prevent drying out. Lobster meat should be sliced thick enough to retain moistness but thin enough to distribute flavor evenly. Layer salad just before serving to avoid sogginess from dressing. Finish with fleur de sel for heightened texture contrast and fresh grind of black pepper adds final aromatic punch. Holding salad too long? Keep components separated until moment of service to retain texture and temperature. Clean grill grates well for clean grill marks and avoidingoff flavors."
tips:
- "Remove seeds from tomatoes — prevents watery mess. Core holds moisture. Roast cut side down, better caramelization, less fuss."
- "Cook potatoes until fork tender — not brown. Yukon golds have creamy interiors, good choice. Maintain shape. Uniform sizes essential."
- "For mayo, slow infusion of oil vital — builds emulsion. Too fast? It breaks. Cold water fixes split mayo. Keep whisking."
- "Grill mushrooms carefully. Flip early to avoid drying out. Shiitakes are firmer, suit grilling. Keep an eye, golden marks preferred."
- "Lobster should be slightly warm. Overcooked? It toughens. Slice tail thin, maintain distinct textures. Mix claw meat gently, preserve chunks."
