ingredients:
- "1 large round sourdough loaf"
- "2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese"
- "4 cloves roasted garlic, mashed"
- "1 tablespoon Italian seasoning blend"
- "1 teaspoon salt"
- "1/2 teaspoon black pepper"
- "1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes"
- "1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika"
- "1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil"
- "==="
- "Dipping Sauce:"
- "1/2 cup mayonnaise"
- "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice"
- "1 teaspoon smoked paprika"
- "1/4 teaspoon garlic powder"
- "Salt and pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 340°F. Lower than usual to prevent burning cheese too fast but still get melt."
- "Cut sourdough into 1-inch strips lengthwise. Rotate 90 degrees and slice again forming a checkerboard. Stop halfway down — don't cut all the way. Leaves a base so bread keeps shape."
- "Mix shredded mozzarella with roasted garlic, Italian seasoning, salt, black pepper, crushed red pepper, and smoked paprika. Roasted garlic adds mellow sweetness instead of raw bite. Smoked paprika brings smokiness without heat."
- "Warm olive oil in microwave 20-30 seconds until liquid and fragrant. Using fingers or spoon tip, stuff cheese mixture gently but fully into every crevice. Don’t over pack or bread won't pull apart easily later. Drizzle remaining olive oil on top lightly."
- "Line baking tray with foil and place bread on it. Cover loosely with another piece of foil to trap steam, ensuring bread warms through without crisping prematurely. Bake 22-25 minutes until cheese begins to ooze and crust feels soft but stable."
- "Remove top foil and broil 2-4 minutes until surface cheese bubbles aggressively with golden spots. Watch carefully. Burnt cheese smells sharp, bitter."
- "Meanwhile whisk mayo, lemon juice, smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper for dipping sauce. Adjust seasoning to taste. Tangy, smoky, creamy all at once."
- "Remove bread from oven. Serve immediately warm and pull apart chunks with fingers. Dunk into sauce. Sounds crisp and toasty, cheese strings pull dramatically, roasted garlic aroma smells rich and inviting."
- "Store leftovers wrapped tightly. Reheat briefly in oven wrapped to avoid drying out."
introduction: "Bread, cheese, garlic. Simple combo that turns snack into a small event. Pull-apart takes time upfront, cutting precisely, stuffing right, but rewards with gooey cheesy pockets at every bite. Roasted garlic over raw for a subtle sweet punch. Olive oil replaces butter — gives less saturated fat and adds fruity depth, plus safer to broil since butter burns fast and blackens. Toss some smoked paprika in to tease the tongue differently than red pepper flakes alone. Sauce? Skip plain butter dip. Mix lemon aioli with smoky paprika to lift the richness. Watch cheese bubbling carefully under broiler — smells change, texture shifts, crisp edges form but center stays stretchable. cues you’ve nailed it. Leftovers? Wrap tight. Reheat low, slower or whole gets chewy. Keep that in mind before making an entire loaf solo."
ingredientsNote: "Mozzarella is best when shredded fresh — pre-shredded has anti-caking agents that can affect melt and texture. Swap for fontina or provolone if you want a deeper flavor, but texture differs. Roasted garlic takes away harsh bite; don’t substitute raw or it’ll be overpowering. Italian seasoning can be a blend or individual dried herbs like oregano, basil, and thyme. Smoked paprika adds a twist — optional but recommended to avoid one-dimensional heat from red pepper flakes alone. Olive oil works better than butter on broil to prevent burning; butter can be swapped back if you monitor broil carefully. Sourdough is key for texture stability, but any sturdy round loaf works; just avoid super soft sandwich bread which turns mushy."
instructionsNote: "Cutting bread half-depth is crucial but tricky — use a serrated bread knife, don’t rush. Stop midway to keep loaf structure so it pulls apart cleanly and holds shape on baking sheet. Stuffing cheese too tightly squishes bread, too loose and you get cheese on tray not inside. Warm oil helps distribute flavors and prevents dryness, but don’t drench bread or it sogs. Covering foil traps moisture to warm through, prevents crust from becoming too crisp early, ensuring melty cheese pockets. Broil last step is all about timing— cheese must bubble and brown, not burn. Smell shifts from sweet garlic to toasted notes tells you time’s up. Sauce can be prepped any time before baking, easy to tweak. Fresh lemon juice brightens, smoky paprika balances fat. No dipping sauce substitute? Use plain garlic butter but add a squeeze of lemon for zip. Pull apart immediately after broil while cheese hot and stretchy. Cool bread loses stretch and becomes clumpy. Leftovers reheat wrapped in foil at 300°F until warm, about 8-10 minutes. Avoid microwave which makes bread gum-like."
tips:
- "Use a serrated knife. Cut deep but not through the bottom. Checkerboard look holds together. Space cuts equally, keeps bread structure. Watch fingers."
- "Roasted garlic sweetens, unlike raw. Don't skip this. Mash it well. Mix with cheese blend. Warm olive oil helps. Distribute flavor without drowning loaf."
- "Foil covering needed. Trap steam. Keeps soft while cheese melts. Remove for broiling, watch closely. Timing crucial. Smell shifts from garlic to toasted notes."
- "Broil last few minutes. Golden bubbles are good. Monitor carefully — burnt cheese ruins vibe. Pull out when edges crisp up. Stretchy cheese is the goal."
- "For dipping sauce, adjust for your taste. Mayo can be heavy, mix lighter. Add garlic and lemon. Smoky paprika balances richness."
- "Last tip - make leftovers work. Wrap tightly. Oven reheat only to avoid chewiness. 300°F around 8-10 minutes wrap helps maintain texture."
faq:
- "q: What if cheese oozes out while baking? a: Too tightly packed cheese. Adjust by loaf. Leave space in crevices. Make sure cuts are right too."
- "q: Can I use another type of bread? a: Yes but choose sturdy ones. Avoid soft sandwich bread. It becomes mushy. Focus on structure."
- "q: What to do with leftover bread? a: Wrap tightly. Reheat in oven at low temp. 300°F no more than 10 minutes. Prevents drying out."
- "q: Dipping sauce alternatives? a: Go for garlic butter. Add lemon for flavor. A squeeze brightens richness. Or skip sauce for pure cheesy fun."
