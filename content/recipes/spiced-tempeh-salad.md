ingredients:
- "=== Vinaigrette ==="
- "90 ml (6 c. to soupe) olive oil"
- "60 ml (1/4 tasse) lime juice fresh pressed"
- "30 ml (2 c. to soupe) whole grain mustard"
- "=== Salad ==="
- "25 ml (1.5 c. to soupe) honey"
- "15 ml (1 c. to soupe) lime juice"
- "5 ml (1 c. to thé) harissa paste"
- "5 ml (1 c. to thé) turmeric powder"
- "2.5 ml (1/2 c. to thé) smoked paprika"
- "1 block tempeh approx 170 g diced"
- "30 ml (2 c. to soupe) olive oil"
- "55 g (1/3 tasse) toasted sunflower seeds"
- "35 g (1/4 tasse) dried sour cherries"
- "140 g (6 cups) mixed mesclun greens"
- "30 g (1 cup) fresh coriander leaves"
- "4 Lebanese cucumbers quartered lengthwise"
- "1 green apple cored julienned"
instructions:
- "=== Vinaigrette ==="
- "Combine olive oil, lime juice, and mustard in a bowl. Whisk briskly; emulsify until slightly thickened. Set aside."
- "=== Salad ==="
- "Whisk honey, lime juice, harissa, turmeric, and smoked paprika. Vibrant orange with flecks of spice."
- "Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Oil shimmers hot. Add diced tempeh spaced out for crisp edges. Let sizzle undisturbed until golden patches appear, about 4-5 minutes. Flip to brown all sides evenly. Remove from heat; pour honey-spice mixture over tempeh while skillet still warm. Tempeh glistens sticky; stir to coat well."
- "Scatter in toasted sunflower seeds and dried cherries. Return to heat for 20 seconds, just enough to warm seeds and soften cherries slightly, releasing aroma. Remove immediately to prevent burn. Season with salt and black pepper."
- "Arrange mesclun, coriander, cucumbers, and apple on plates or a large platter. Top with still-warm tempeh mixture. Drizzle vinaigrette generously but evenly. Toss lightly with tongs if serving communal. Serve promptly to keep greens crisp."
- "Adjust seasoning after plating if needed. Bright acidity from lime cuts sweetness and richness; balance is key."
introduction: "Bright mesclun. Crisp green apple julienned thin — crunch and tartness. Cucumbers fresh, sliced lengthwise; protect freshness until dress. Tempeh blocks diced smaller, for more surface to caramelize. Honey balanced with harissa heat and smoky paprika replaces curry for a new twist. Toasted sunflower seeds swap pumpkin seeds — equally crunchy, cheaper at bulk stores. Sour cherries, tart and chewy, take the place of golden raisins — a sharper punch. Dress with lime juice and olive oil, mustard thickens and holds. Four servings, meal or hearty salad side. Timing crucial — don’t overcook tempeh or it dries; watch for golden crusts. Crisp greens require immediate dressing for brightness but avoid wilt by gentle toss. Fresh coriander smells bright, lift bouquet hint. Keep vinaigrette separated until right before serving; acidity balances, oil richness coats leaves. Efficient, straightforward prepping; sharp eyes on textures, aromas. Fall back on lemon if no lime; maple syrup for honey. Tempeh can swap for firm tofu pressed and marinated, but adjust pan time. Simple, but complicated balance of textures and flavor layers. Light but satisfying."
ingredientsNote: "Honey quantity reduced slightly compared to original to allow for turmeric’s earthy bitterness and spicy paprika. Harissa kept moderate for approachable heat; can dial up or down. Turmeric replaces curry powder for distinct color and gentler bitterness, smoked paprika offers deep aroma and warmth absent in cari spice. Sunflower seeds – cheaper, allergy-friendly, maintain toasty crunch if roasted until barely golden then cooled. Sour cherries bring tart balance; drying depends on brand freshness, soak quickly in warm water to rehydrate if too hard. Mesclun blend can vary—choose fresh, tender leaves with minimal wilting; rinse and spin dry thoroughly to avoid watering down. Coriander not parsley — distinctive aromatic sharpness. Lebanese cucumbers preferred for sweetness and thin skin; regular cucumber can be substituted but peel if waxed. Fresh lime juice brighter and less bitter than lemon here, but can swap if unavailable."
instructionsNote: "Warming tempeh in a hot, dry nonstick pan first lets natural nutty aromas develop; resist moving too soon for crisp edges — flick pan slightly to judge if tempeh loosens easily before flipping. Adding honey-spice mixture off direct heat keeps sugars from burning, preserves glossy sheen and sticky texture. Adding seeds and dried fruit last and rewarming briefly softens fruit without caramelizing sugars or burning nuts — too long and bitterness develops quickly. Seasoning with salt and pepper after finishing prevents toughening tempeh. Drizzle vinaigrette last to maintain mesclun crunch; tossing before plating wilts greens prematurely and dilutes dressing flavor. If preparing ahead, keep dressing separate. When plating, distribute cucumbers and apples evenly to balance each bite. Use tongs for gentle folding, don’t mash leaves. Watch vinaigrette: mustard vital for emulsification, coats ingredients better than a simple oil-lemon drizzle, preventing dry spots. Tempeh can stick if pan too cool or overcrowded; space pieces well. If pan overheats, flavors can scorch – lower heat and add oil in stages. Rest tempeh briefly after cooking to let juices redistribute, enhancing texture. Adapt cooking time ±1-2 minutes depending on stove and pan thickness; golden, crisp edges, deep aroma, tactile resistance indicates cooked through."
tips:
- "Mix olive oil warm until emulsified; whisk mustard in. Texture matters, don't rush it. Be precise with honey's warmth to balance flavors. Tempeh, keep it spaced out in pan. Hot nonstick brings out nutty aroma."
- "Watch for golden color on tempeh. Flip when edges crisp, about 4-5 minutes. Honey-spice mix off heat prevents burning. Don't overcrowd; space equals crunch. Seeds added last for proper toasting. Quick warm-up."
- "Cucumbers? Lebanese are sweet and thin-skinned. Skip waxed varieties if possible. Apples julienned thin for crunch and tartness, balance is everything. Mesclun greens? Fresh, tender. Spin dry after washing to avoid wilting."
- "Acidity, crucial for balance. Lime juice cut sweetness down. If missing, lemon's fine in a pinch. Use tongs for gentle tossing. Avoid mashing greens; light touch is key. Watch timing, serve promptly to preserve textures."
faq:
- "q: Can I use tofu instead of tempeh? a: Yes, press firm tofu, marinate it. Adjust timing, pan needs different heat level. Watch for sticking."
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Keep vinaigrette separate to prevent sogginess. Salad can keep in fridge 1-2 days max; expect some wilting. Fresh ingredients matter."
- "q: What if I can't find sour cherries? a: Dried cranberries work, but sweetness not the same. Rinse them in warm water if too tough, softens them nicely."
- "q: How do I keep the greens fresh longer? a: Wash and dry, like lettuce. Store in airtight containers. Paper towels help absorb moisture, keeps greens crisp."
