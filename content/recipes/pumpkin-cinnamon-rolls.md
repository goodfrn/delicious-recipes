slug: "pumpkin-cinnamon-rolls"
description: "Yeast dough enriched with pumpkin puree and brown sugar, layered with spiced filling. Brown butter cream cheese frosting cools, melts over warm rolls. Rise times flexible but watch dough double in size. Heavy cream brushed before baking keeps rolls moist while baking to 190°F internal temp. Substituted honey for white sugar, and coconut oil instead of butter for dairy twist. Careful with milk temp to preserve yeast life. Sticky but tacky dough signals readiness; avoid over-kneading. Floss slicing keeps rolls intact, parchment-lined pan helps catch spills. Brown butter sets firm in fridge before frosting. Bake until tops are golden, smell sweet cinnamon filling, cool slightly, then frost immediately."

ingredients:
- "3/4 cup whole milk, warmed to 100°F-110°F"
- "6 tablespoons coconut oil, melted and slightly cooled"
- "2/3 cup pumpkin puree"
- "1/3 cup honey"
- "1/2 cup light brown sugar"
- "1 teaspoon fine sea salt"
- "1 large egg, room temp"
- "2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast"
- "4 cups bread flour, divided"
- "3/4 cup packed brown sugar for filling"
- "2 teaspoons cinnamon"
- "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg"
- "3/4 cup heavy cream, lukewarm"
- "6 tablespoons unsalted butter, browned and chilled"
- "8 ounces cream cheese, softened"
- "1 1/2 cups powdered sugar"
- "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
- "pinch kosher salt"
instructions:
- "Warm milk gently in small saucepan to about 100°F-110°F. Should feel lukewarm on finger. Too hot? Kills yeast. Blend warm milk with melted coconut oil. Set aside to cool slightly if needed."
- "In mixer bowl, paddle attachment on low, combine pumpkin, honey, brown sugar, and salt. Add milk/oil mixture, egg, and yeast. Mix just to combine. No heavy cream yet."
- "Switch to dough hook, add 1 cup flour. Medium speed, mix ~1 minute. Add 1 cup more flour, repeat. Keep adding flour in quarters, scraping bowl if flour piles up at edges. Dough will start sticky, turn into tacky ball that pulls from bowl smoothly but sticks slightly to touch. Knead 7-9 minutes. Too sticky? Add flour one tablespoon at a time."
- "Grease medium bowl with oil spray. Shape dough into ball, place in bowl turning once to coat top. Cover with plastic wrap or thin kitchen towel. Rest in warm spot until doubled roughly 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Warmth critical; too cold slows rise, too hot kills yeast."
- "While dough rises, brown butter in skillet over medium heat, swirl constantly. Watch for nutty aroma, golden color, toasted milk solids. Pour into cooled container, refrigerate 1-2 hours until firm but spreadable. Over-browned butter tastes bitter, discard and restart."
- "Prep 9×13 pan with baking spray or line with parchment to catch drips. Prevents burnt sugar on pan bottom."
- "Mix filling: brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg in medium bowl until uniform. Optionally add chopped pecans or raisins for texture."
- "Lightly flour work surface. Turn dough out gently, pat into rectangle about 12x10 inches. Spread filling evenly almost to edges; leaving tiny margin helps roll tight."
- "Roll dough tightly from long edge. Resist stopping halfway to avoid air pockets. Slice with unwaxed floss or very sharp serrated knife into 12-14 rolls. Place snugly in prepared pan, seam side down. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and warm towel. Let rise until puffy again, 25-40 minutes depending on room temp. For overnight rise, refrigerate covered 8-12 hours and bake next day."
- "Preheat oven to 350°F. Warm heavy cream briefly in microwave until just lukewarm. When ready to bake, brush cream evenly over rolls—this keeps rolls moist and tender inside while baking."
- "Bake 22-25 minutes until golden top, pulls slightly from pan edges, internal temp 190°F. Aroma rich, sugary, spiced with pumpkin notes."
- "Cool rolls 5-10 minutes before frosting. Beat brown butter in mixer until creamy, add cream cheese; blend until lump-free. Add powdered sugar, vanilla, pinch salt; beat until thick but spreadable. Frost warm rolls generously so frosting melts into nooks."
- "Serve warm. Store leftovers wrapped tightly to keep soft. Reheat gently or toast for fresh feel."
introduction: "Sticky dough, yeasty aroma filling the air. Pumpkin enriching every fold, sweetness not just from sugar but honey hum. Coconut oil in place of butter keeps it light but rich. Brown butter frosting—a nutty, creamy punch. Timing on rises varies with heat in kitchen. Watch dough double, not triple or you’ll risk overproofing and collapse. Slicing with floss ensures neater rolls, no squashed edges. Warm cream brush before baking helps soft crumb inside with a slight crust on top. Brown sugar filling spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg is simple but hits those autumnal notes hard. This isn't a quick bake – patience rewards in textures and layers. Turns out tender, pull-apart rolls bursting with flavor and that special aroma that makes you come back for another. Old school techniques but dialing in flavors with a few subtle swaps to keep things interesting. Don’t rush after baking; cake-like softness comes after cooling and frosting meld."
ingredientsNote: "Milk temp critical for yeast upkeep. Swap any whole milk for oat or almond milk warmed to similar temp, but beware yeast activity may slow slightly. Coconut oil replaces butter in dough — adds subtle sweetness and dairy-free option. Brown sugar in filling can be half demerara for crunch contrast or add finely chopped nuts for texture. Honey softens dough, replaces some white sugar; if unavailable use light maple syrup instead. Brown butter: careful watch on heat; pointer: swirl pan constantly and remove from heat when bubbles subside but solids darken. Refrigerate brown butter so spread soft but not liquid—helps frosting hold shape on rolls. Flour choice matters — bread flour gives chew, all-purpose will work but rolls turn softer, possibly squishier. Heavy cream tosses in moisture and richness before baking; skim milk won’t do. For frosting, cream cheese must be softened to avoid lumps, else warm briefly in microwave but don’t melt. Parchment-lined pan highly recommended if you're lazy about cleanup or filling is runny."
instructionsNote: "Milk and oil—mixed at proper temp keeps yeast alive. Too hot? Yeast dies, no rise. Mixing flour slowly incorporates slowly avoids dense lumps. Kneading forms gluten network; tacky, not sticky, is the magic touch. Oil your bowl well — dough sticks less and forms smooth skin during rising. Watch rise in warm, draft-free place; off by a few minutes? Dough can overflow or fail to rise properly. Brown butter for frosting is delicate process — if smoking turn heat down immediately or start again, no bitterness allowed. Flour your surface light – dough is sticky, but too much flour ruins roll texture. Floss slicing saves fingers from squashed, pulling rolls. Rest rolls for second rise in the pan until puffy — under proof means tight crumb, over rises collapse. Brush cream on just before oven — steam from cream helps crumb soften. Bake until top is light golden and internal temp 190°F to confirm doneness without overbaking dry crumb. Cool but not cold before frosting; warm rolls cause frosting to melt excessively, cold leads to lumps when spreading. Beat frosting vigorously to airy creaminess—don’t skimp on mixing here. Serve warm, room temp leftovers store well covered and can be reheated gently to revive."
tips:
- "Watch milk temp closely. 100°F to 110°F works best to keep yeast happy. Too hot? Kills it quick. Use a thermometer for accuracy."
- "Dough should be tacky not sticky. Knead until silky but add flour cautiously. A little at a time. Don't overdo it—avoid dense rolls."
- "Rising time varies. Warm kitchen? Faster rise. Cold spot? Slow. Watch the dough, not the clock. Should double not triple. Pay attention."
- "Floss slicing is a chef's friend. Neat cuts keep rolls intact. Sharp knife can squish—don't squish. Use unwaxed floss—no mess."
- "Brown butter for frosting needs watchful eye. Swirl constantly; aroma tells you when ready. Cool before frosting—warm frosting runs."
faq:
- "q: What if yeast doesn't rise? a: Check milk temp, room temp. Too cold? Yeast sleeps. Too hot? Yeast dies. Try again with fresh yeast."
- "q: Can I use a different milk? a: Yes! Oat or almond work but temp is key; same 100°F. Just know yeast activity might slow."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Wrap tightly to keep soft. Chill in fridge. Reheat gently—microwave a bit, or toast for a fresh bite."
- "q: What if dough is too sticky? a: Add flour bit by bit. Don't panic. Little by little until you're back to that tacky feel."
