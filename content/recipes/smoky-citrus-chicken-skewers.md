ingredients:
- "1 1/4 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs cut into 1 inch cubes"
- "1 teaspoon fine sea salt"
- "1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper"
- "1/2 cup chipotle-orange glaze (see note)"
- "16 bamboo skewers soaked in water for at least 20 minutes"
- "8 large Bibb lettuce leaves rinsed and patted dry"
- "1 cup diced fresh mango"
- "1/2 cup finely diced red bell pepper"
- "1/4 cup finely chopped red onion"
- "1 jalapeño seeded and minced"
- "Juice of 1 lime"
- "1/2 cup creamy avocado crema (replace blue cheese; see note)"
- "1-2 teaspoons vegetable oil for pan frying"
instructions:
- "If grilling heat grill to medium, clean and oil grates well to prevent sticking."
- "Combine chicken chunks with salt, pepper and 1/2 cup chipotle-orange glaze in a large bowl. Toss until chicken pieces are well coated. Let sit 5-10 minutes—short marinate to boost flavor without breaking down meat."
- "Thread chicken evenly onto soaked skewers, about 1 ounce per skewer. Do not pack too tightly to ensure even cooking and faster heat penetration. Leave small gaps so edges char and develop flavor without steaming."
- "If grilling place skewers on hot grill. Expect sizzle and faint smoke. Baste frequently with remaining glaze to keep edges moist and add layers of flavor. Rotate every 2-3 minutes aiming for light char spots. Total cook about 10-12 minutes but check often. Chicken should feel firm; juices run clear. Use instant thermometer to confirm internal temperature hits 165°F."
- "Alternative pan frying: heat 1-2 teaspoons vegetable oil in heavy skillet over medium heat until shimmer. Add chicken pieces carefully, discarding leftover glaze. Allow sear for 2-3 minutes, don’t crowd pan. Toss occasionally to brown evenly on all sides. Like grilling, chicken firm to touch, white juices is indicator. Total cook 12-15 minutes depends on cube size."
- "Remove cooked chicken from heat and let rest 4 minutes. Resting lets juices redistribute, avoiding dry meat."
- "Meanwhile mix mango, bell pepper, red onion, jalapeño and lime juice to make salsa with bright acidity and crunch."
- "To assemble remove chicken from skewers. Place a few pieces in each Bibb lettuce leaf. Add a spoonful of mango salsa, drizzle creamy avocado crema over top. Fold loosely. Contrast of soft creamy, crisp lettuce, smoky and bright flavors deliver balance."
- "Serve immediately. Use sharp knife to cut through tender chicken easily skip fork if eating by hand."
introduction: "Chicken thighs bite-sized, salty pepper kicks tossed in a chipotle-orange glaze for smoky fire and citrus pop. Wooden picks soaked so they don’t burn or catch flame. Skewered loosely—too tight squashes juices trapped inside. Heat a grill to medium, listen for that steady sizzle; the sound of fat snapping and juices sealing in. Baste regularly, glaze thickening on edges like sticky enamel. Char cries out flavor, watch carefully or dryness sneaks in. No grill? Hot skillet with oil shimmy does the same work; you want crust forming. The salsa? Sweet mango balances heat, crunch in bell pepper for texture. Avocado crema replaces blue cheese—cool smoothness against smoky. Lettuce crisp as a crackling fire, folds hold everything together but don’t steam the chicken. Rest chicken; patience pays off juicy meat every time. 35 minutes from start to crisp-wrapped bites."
ingredientsNote: "Chicken thighs preferred over breast for moisture retention—less chance of dried out meat. If thighs unavailable, go with breasts but reduce cook time and keep watch. Chipotle-orange glaze swaps barbecue sauce; smoky chipotle with citrus notes adds complexity. If glaze unavailable, mix adobo sauce with orange juice and honey as a quick substitute. Blue cheese replaced by avocado crema here—easier to manage and mellows heat, but feel free to crumble feta or queso fresco for salty tang. Soaking skewers crucial to avoid flare-ups or blackened sticks spoiling tender meat. Julienne mango and peppers fresh to add crunch, balance heat and smoke, no canned salsa—that’s sacrilege. Vegetable oil used in pan frying because of high smoke point; olive oil burns faster. Rest time neglected often, but essential for juicy meat sealing."
instructionsNote: "Threading skewers loosely allows heat contact and browning, avoid packing chicken cubes together or they’ll steam instead. Grill grate must be clean and oiled—prevents sticking and white loss of meat juices which equal dryness. Basting frequently keeps surface moist; glaze intensifies flavor layers. Turn skewers every 2-3 minutes for uniform char, avoid flipping too often which cools grill. Pan frying mimics this with smaller batches, don’t crowd chicken or temperature dips shutting down Maillard reaction. Look for firm, pale opaque chicken with slight caramelized edges. Instant thermometer is your best friend here—165°F internal means done without guessing. Resting meat—carryover heat finishes cooking and lets juices settle back inside; skipping rest leads to dry chicken. Assemble wraps quickly, lettuce leaves crisp and cool; avoid warm plates which wilt them. Chop salsa and make crema while chicken cooks—efficient mise en place saves real time. Serve immediately to keep contrast between warm meat and fresh crunchy wrap shells."
tips:
- "Bamboo skewers must soak for at least 20 mins. Avoid flare-ups, prevents them from burning. No dried sticks ruining flavor. Use lots of water."
- "Don't crowd chicken pieces while cooking, letting air circulate; it’s key. Cook in batches if pan frying. Sear to lock in moisture. Pay attention."
- "Using thighs is smart, more moisture than breasts keep things juicy. If only breasts available, cut cooking time; don’t overcook. Avoid dryness."
- "For glaze, chipotle-orange adds layers. Out of that? Use orange juice, add adobo sauce with honey as a quick sub. Always have backups in mind."
- "Lettuce leaves should be crisp. Pat dry well. Too wet makes them soggy. Quick tip: chop salsa while chicken cooks. Keep efficiency high."
faq:
- "q: How to tell if chicken is done? a: Look for firm texture, pale color. Juices should run clear. Instant thermometer checks give peace of mind."
- "q: What if I don’t have an outdoor grill? a: Use a heavy skillet with a bit of oil. Heat until it shimmers. Indoor method works well. Same principles."
- "q: Can skewers be reused? a: Yes, but clean thoroughly. No leftover residue. Bacteria loves that. Always soak again if reusing. Saves on waste."
- "q: What’s best way to store leftovers? a: Wrap tightly in airtight container. Reheat gently in oven or skillet. Avoid microwave; dries out chicken."
