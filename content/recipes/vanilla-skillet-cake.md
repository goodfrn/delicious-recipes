title: "Vanilla Skillet Cake"
slug: "vanilla-skillet-cake"
description: "A quick, simple vanilla cake baked in a skillet. Uses all-purpose flour and baking powder combined with butter, sugar, and egg. Vanilla extract swapped for almond extract for a nutty aroma. Milk replaced by half plain yogurt for moisture and tang. Baked around 35 minutes; tactile cues guide readiness. The method flips usual mixing and baking steps. Cake cools inverted atop the skillet, making for easy release. A technique swap aside, the fundamentals remain: creaming butter and sugar, folding, alternating wet and dry. A practical twist, avoiding specialized pans. Easy substitutions outlined, troubleshooting typical pitfalls like dense crumb or sticking. Reliable for unsweetened, simple dessert needs. Savory twist suggested for advanced cooks."
metaDescription: "Vanilla Skillet Cake, quick bake, almond extract twist. Cream butter right for fluffy finish. Sensory cues guide doneness."
ogDescription: "Vanilla Skillet Cake, nutty aroma from almond extract. Simple bake, creamed butter texture ensures lightness. Watch for golden edges."

ingredients:
- "150 ml unbleached all-purpose flour (5/8 cup)"
- "6 ml baking powder (1 1/4 tsp)"
- "100 ml softened unsalted butter (7 tbsp)"
- "100 ml white sugar (1/3 cup plus 1 tbsp)"
- "1 large egg"
- "2.5 ml almond extract (1/2 tsp)"
- "60 ml plain yogurt (1/4 cup)"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 175°C (350°F). Center rack. Butter and flour an 18cm (7 inch) oven-safe skillet or heavy-bottomed pan, roughly 2 liters capacity. Skip non-stick sprays; butter adds flavor and texture."
- "Sift flour and baking powder into a bowl. Makes incorporation easier, avoids lumps."
- "Cream butter and sugar at medium speed with electric mixer till pale and fluffy. Key here; creaming traps air, sets cake’s texture."
- "Beat in egg, then almond extract; combine fully but avoid overmixing or batter will toughen."
- "Add flour mix in thirds, alternating with yogurt in halves. Folding gently by hand saves some lightness. Thick batter will loosen slightly, signaling readiness."
- "Pour batter into skillet, spread evenly with spatula. Tap skillet lightly on counter to release air bubbles."
- "Bake for 33–38 minutes. Watch crust color; golden edges, springy center. Use toothpick test: inserted clean or crumbs attached, done. Too moist means longer bake, not dry; cake continues cooking resting."
- "Remove skillet, invert cake onto wire rack once cool enough to handle. Leave pan on cake during cooling to avoid cracking and aid shape set."
- "Serve as is or dust with powdered sugar, fresh fruit or whipped cream if you want extras."
- "Notes: Yogurt adds moisture plus subtle tang, replaces milk well without thinning batter. Almond extract swaps vanilla for subtle nutty flavor but keep extract quantity low to prevent overpowering."
- "If no skillet, use 20cm round cake pan. Adjust baking time, monitor doneness closely."
- "Butter must be room temp for proper creaming, else cake will be dense."
- "Overmixing flour means gluten development, cake gets chewy, avoid vigorous mixing after flour addition."
- "Resting inverted cools cake with minimal surface moisture accumulation and preserves crisp edges."
introduction: "No fuss vanilla cake but not as you know it. Skillet baking, not pan, means better crust and even rising but you must butter and flour well. Creaming the butter and sugar is where lightness starts, if you skimp here you’ll regret later. Almond extract swaps vanilla because it’s less common, nutty, and plays well with the yogurt’s tang. Yogurt instead of milk thickens the body, adds moisture without runny batter. Mix carefully, folding in dry ingredients avoids gluten overload, which means no toughness in bite. Oven cues are your guide—watch color, poke the cake, springy center, not just timer. Cooling inverted is a chef’s trick to keep cake moist but with firm crust. Basic ingredients with a subtle twist. No gimmicks. Only fundamentals you rely on."
ingredientsNote: "Butter softened, not melted, is critical to trap air during creaming. Sugar amount reduced slightly to counter yogurt’s mild tang. Plain yogurt chosen to balance texture and acidity, replace the milk you might lack or want to enrich. Baking powder quantity increased a notch to balance heavier batter from yogurt. Almond extract introduces a faintly toasted aroma instead of vanilla’s floral note, good when vanilla extract goes missing or you want less familiar taste. Flour sifted with baking powder ensures even leavening, no clumps forming dense pockets. White sugar used for neutral sweetness; brown sugar will change flavor and texture noticeably. Adjust sugar slightly if substituting dairy or non-dairy yogurt for moisture content differences."
instructionsNote: "Butter and flour skillet thoroughly, do not rely on spray or skip this step—cake sticking is a common failure here. Crema butter and sugar until pale and aerated, min 3 minutes at medium-high speed; anything less results in denser crumb. Incorporate egg and extract fully without overbeating, which can break emulsions and ruin texture. Alternate dry flour mix with yogurt in thirds, fold with rubber spatula gently; mixing post-flour addition ruins texture by developing gluten. Batter consistency should be pourable but thick, soft spatula scoop. Baking time is approximate: sensory cues are paramount—golden edges, slightly cracked top, springs back when lightly touched, and toothpick test. Don’t rush removing from oven, residual heat finishes bake. Cool cake upside down on wired rack with skillet in place to trap steam, supports crumb with crisp crust. Not doing so risks broken crust, soggy edges. Can be dusted with sugar or served with fruit for bright contrast but straightforward works as a blank canvas."
tips:
- "Butter softened, critical for aeration. Cream till pale, at least three minutes. Not enough air means a denser cake. Watch for fluffiness. Milk for yogurt adjustment? Moisture balance changes."
- "Sifting flour with baking powder? Avoid lumps. Making batter lighter. Clumps mean dense bites. Measure accurately too. Don’t forget butter flour pan. No sticking mess means better release."
- "Baking time isn’t just a clock watch. Look for golden edges. Gently press center. Should spring back. Toothpick test, that’s key. If moist, longer bake, but no overbake too."
- "Common mistakes? Overmixing post-flour means gluten tough. Cake may sink or come out gummy. Rainbow of baking issues—know them. Be cautious with too-cold ingredients."
- "Inverted cooling? It traps steam, keeps edges firm. Prevents sogginess too. Easy fix for moisture on top. If edges burn, lower rack next time, you’ll save it."
faq:
- "q: How avoid gummy cake? a: Check mixing method. Too much gluten? Possible. Cream well, keep temperature even. Bake fully too."
- "q: What if I forget to soften butter? a: Warm it gently till spreadable. No full melt. Cool dough could reduce rise. Keep creaming time consistent."
- "q: Yogurt options? a: Dairy, plant-based both work, but watch for tang. Experiment with texture, might need adjustments in recipes. Non-dairy replacements need monitoring."
- "q: Storing leftover cake tips? a: Room temp great, keep wrapped. Avoid drying. Fridge dries quicker. Reheat? Low heat to soften crust. Adjust to keep edges from crumbling."
