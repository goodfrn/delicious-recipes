ingredients:
- "1 small red onion, finely minced"
- "3 green onions, sliced thin"
- "60 ml (4 tbsp) fresh chives, chopped"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) Asian chili garlic sauce"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) vegan mayo (eg. Veganii brand)"
- "1 egg yolk"
- "10 white fish sticks, shredded"
- "3 cans 100 g (3.5 oz) drained crab chunks"
- "80 ml (1/3 cup) gluten-free panko breadcrumbs"
- "Tempura batter mix (store-bought)"
- "Extra panko breadcrumbs for coating"
- "Pinch salt and black pepper"
instructions:
- "Heat oil in deep fryer to 185 °C (365 °F). Line tray with paper towels."
- "In a mixing bowl, combine red onion, green onion, chives, chili sauce, mayo, and egg yolk. Use fork; don’t overbeat."
- "Fold in shredded fish sticks, crab pieces, and 80 ml panko. Season with salt and pepper. Mixture should hold together but remain moist."
- "Shape into 12 small (about 55 ml) or 6 large (about 130 ml) patties. Chill if too soft for handling."
- "Prepare tempura batter per package, using slightly less cold water for thicker coat. Pour panko breadcrumbs into a shallow bowl separately."
- "Dip each fritter in tempura batter, then dredge well with panko. Light pressing helps coating stick better."
- "Fry 2-3 small or 2 large at once, 3 to 4 minutes, until crust is deep golden and bubbling stops. Adjust heat to maintain steady sizzle."
- "Drain on paper towel-lined tray. Serve immediately or keep warm in low oven. For sushi-style rolls, cool briefly before assembling."
introduction: "Crab cakes that crackle with heat and crunch, not mushy blobs. Swap some snow crab with shredded white fish here for better texture. Red onion and fresh chives add sharpness, while chili garlic sauce punches up the heat but not too much—learn control in spice balancing. Using tempura batter instead of eggs keeps coating crisp and light, no greasy heaviness. Watch the oil temperature closely; dropping too low will cause soggy crust, too high and the crust burns before the inside warms. Chill your formed cakes if mixtures feel weak; it firms them so frying goes smoother, less risk of breakage. Toasted Japanese panko—go gluten-free if you need—lasts crunchiest. Avoid bread crumbs with finer grain; they flop. Fry small batches only or they drop temp fast, leading to greasy fritters. Ultimate takeaway: watch your mix moisture, oil heat, and coat thickness. Simple steps but nail them and you're golden-fried glory every time."
ingredientsNote: "Onion choices matter: red for sharp bite, sweeter whites mute flavor. Chives can be replaced with fresh parsley or scallions for fresher punch, but watch quantity to avoid overpowering. The chili garlic sauce can be swapped for sriracha or homemade chili paste depending on heat preference. Vegan mayo works for dairy sensitivity; egg yolk critical for binding but if you need to swap, try flaxseed slurry (1 tbsp flaxseed meal + 3 tbsp water). White fish sticks replace imitation crab for better texture and less sweetness. Panko breadcrumbs provide airy crunch; avoid using standard breadcrumbs as they absorb too much oil. Tempura batter mix ensures light coating; if unavailable, mix equal parts rice flour and cornstarch with sparkling water. Salt and pepper should be final seasoning judge; crab can vary widely in salt content. Resting mix in fridge tightens it, prevents crumble. Use freshest crab you can access—canned drained well or fresh lumps."
instructionsNote: "Always test oil temperature with small piece before frying fritters; ideal is steady sizzle without smoke. Mix ingredients gently; overmixing crushes crab lumps and makes dense fritters. When dipping in tempura, do it quickly to avoid batter thickening and clumping. Press panko gently after dredging so crumbs adhere but don’t overload or crust will be dense and soggy inside. Don’t overcrowd fryer; oil temp drops, resulting in greasy fritters and uneven cooking. Look for bubbling to slow down as sign crust is browning properly. Remove when crust is golden, not burnt. Drain fritters on paper towels immediately. If making large fritters, consider longer frying but watch for drying out. Hold cooked fritters in warm oven rather than stacking to keep crispness, stacking leads to steam sogginess. Leftover batter can clump, keep it cold until use or stir in extra sparkling water to thin. Make crab cakes 30 minutes ahead to help hold together."
tips:
- "Watch oil temp closely. Too low? Fritters absorb oil, soggy mess. Too hot? Crust burns before inside warms. Ideal is steady sizzle."
- "If fritter mixture feels too soft for shaping, chill for 20 minutes. Firms it up, keeps structure while frying. Less breakage."
- "Experiment with fish options. Cod or tilapia can swap for white fish sticks. Texture varies, adjust moisture accordingly."
- "Using panko instead of regular crumbs? Good move. Standard crumbs soak up oil. Airy panko stays crispier longer. Avoid heavy components."
- "Oil temperature drops when adding too many fritters. Fry small batches only, watch bubbling slows. Greasy fritters? Not what you want."
faq:
- "q: Can I make these fritters ahead? a: Yes, prep mixture early, chill. Fry later. Keeps together better. Don’t leave out too long."
- "q: What's best way to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. Reheat in oven for crispness. Microwaving will sog them."
- "q: Can I use canned crab? a: Yes, but drain thoroughly. Fresh crab gives better taste. Canned might alter texture slightly. Adjust moisture."
- "q: What if the batter is too thick? a: Add cold water. Thin out carefully. Don’t go too watery, hard to coat fritters."
