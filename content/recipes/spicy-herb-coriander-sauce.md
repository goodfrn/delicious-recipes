ingredients:
- "40 g (1 cup loosely packed) coriander leaves and tender stems"
- "20 g (3/4 cup) flat leaf parsley leaves"
- "1 small garlic clove, halved"
- "1 serrano chili, seeded and chopped (milder than jalapeño but more aromatic)"
- "80 ml (5 tbsp) extra virgin olive oil"
- "70 ml (1/3 cup) water"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) ground coriander seeds"
- "3 ml (3/4 tsp) sugar"
- "3 ml (3/4 tsp) fine sea salt"
- "1 ml (1/4 tsp) smoked paprika (replaces cardamom for warmth)"
- "1 pinch freshly ground black pepper"
- "1 tsp lemon zest (optional, added twist)"
instructions:
- "Gather fresh herbs, discard any wilted stems. Rough chop parsley and coriander. Gear up blender or food processor."
- "Add herbs with garlic and serrano chili, pulse coarsely. Watch the texture — don’t over-process into puree. You want a chunky paste that holds some green bits for texture and visual appeal."
- "Pour in olive oil and water while pulsing slowly to combine. The oil adds richness and the water adjusts texture — too thick makes spooning or drizzling difficult. Aim for a loose, spreadable consistency."
- "Add ground coriander seeds, smoked paprika, salt, sugar, black pepper, and lemon zest if using. Pulse a few more times to fold spices evenly."
- "Taste immediately — adjust salt or heat as needed. If too hot, add more parsley or a splash of water to mellow. Too thick, add oil or water by tablespoon until right."
- "Transfer to airtight container, refrigerate. The sauce darkens slightly, flavors deepen after a few hours. Usable for up to 3 days. Stir before serving — oil may separate on top."
- "Serve chilled or room temp over grilled seafood, roasted corn, or as a spicy condiment on sandwiches."
introduction: "Leafy piles of coriander and parsley waiting. The punch of serrano—not shy like that jalapeño. Blending herbs with a dusty warm note from coriander seeds, not cumin this time. Paprika for depth, subtle smoky whisper replacing pungency of cardamom. Lemon zest cutting through oil’s richness. Chunky, green flecked paste; smells herbal, sharp, spicy. Garlic biting but mellow. Quick lash-up in blender, no fuss, but attention where texture is king. Not puree. Only pulse. Shelf life short. Best fresh but three days refrigerated fine. Use as spoonable sauce, swirl on hot crust or drizzle over smoky meat. If too thick, trick—add warm water by drop, loosen up without shrinking flavor. If chili too fierce, more parsley calms heat. The sauce talks back—watch it, taste often. Puts a vibrant spin on 'zhoug' for those who want bright, layered heat but less harsh. No fuss. Lots of punch."
ingredientsNote: "Herbs fresh picked or store bought, never wilted—green vibrancy matters. Parsley adds freshness, balances coriander’s earthiness. Substituting serrano for jalapeño switches heat profile slightly: serrano sharper but less grassy, better layered flavors. Ground coriander seeds instead of cumin for a different warm note, less familiar but lifts sauce on finish. Smoked paprika replaces cardamom; less floral, more smoky depth. Lemon zest—not usual but lifts oiliness, brightens entire paste. Olive oil quality important but not fancy extra virgin; mid-range suffices. Water smooths texture, prevent dry chalky paste; use cold or room temp tap, not chilled. Garlic small, so flavor bursts but doesn’t overwhelm. Adjust chili heat by adding seeds back or reducing altogether—personal touch. Sugar tames acidity and heat without sweetness; critical balance. Salt brings all alive, layer by layer. If storage planned more than 3 days, freeze in portioned containers; oil may separate but stir when thawed, texture less fresh but flavors intact."
instructionsNote: "Rough chopping herbs before blender prevents overheating, keeps herbal oils bright. Using short pulses rather than continuous run avoids paste overprocessing. Watch blade contact; scrape sides once midway to keep ingredients even. Pour liquid components gradually, allows better control on texture. Texture check by spoon test—should hold shape but spread easily. Overly thin means flavor dilution; add more herbs or spices later not water. Balance seasoning at end, sauce tastes dull if salt below threshold. Keep track of heat level—pepper seeds carry mostly capsaicin; adjust accordingly. Storing airtight crucial—oxidation dulls color and flavor fast. Watch oil layer forming on surface, stir before serving keeps emulsification intact. Tips: if no blender, chop herbs very fine with knife, then fold in oil and spices by hand; more rustic but same flavor. Use fresh lemon zest not bottled, old zest bitter. If sauce too bitter, small pinch sugar smooths edge. Always use dry measuring spoons for spices to prevent clumps. Timing flexible—herbs change fast once cut so work efficiently but do not rush onto blender raw and clumped. Smell and color are your guides."
tips:
- "Chop herbs right before blending. Cuts down on bitterness, keeps bright colors. Pulse blending, don’t run constantly. Texture is key; chunky, not smooth."
- "Olive oil — quality matters, but keep it mid-range. Not too fancy. Adjust water gradually. It smooths thick mixes without losing flavor. Spoon test to check."
- "Serrano chili sharpness varies. Use more or less as needed. Seeds bring heat. If too fiery, add more parsley or a splash of water."
- "Lemon zest is not typical, but it wakes flavors up. Adds brightness to the whole mix. Skip if you prefer, but it lifts all the rich notes."
- "Storing makes a difference. Keep in an airtight container to prevent oxidation. If you see oil separation, just stir before serving."
faq:
- "q: How to adjust spice level a: If too hot, add more parsley or even water. Use some chili seeds for milder. Taste often. Must balance it."
- "q: How long does it last a: Three days tops in fridge. Store covered to keep flavor strong. Freeze portions if longer storage needed."
- "q: Can I substitute ingredients a: Yes, parsley can replace cilantro. Use a milder pepper if serrano seems too strong. But keep the balance."
- "q: What if my blend is too thick a: Add more oil or water, bit by bit. Blend again until it reaches desired spreadable texture. Shouldn't be dry."
