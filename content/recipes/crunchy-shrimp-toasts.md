ingredients:
- "12 g coriander stems and leaves chopped"
- "1 spring onion cut into chunks"
- "1 small clove garlic halved"
- "170 g peeled and deveined shrimp patted dry"
- "1 large egg"
- "10 ml tamari sauce"
- "5 ml chili garlic sauce"
- "40 g mixed black and white sesame seeds"
- "4 slices crusty sandwich bread"
- "200 ml vegetable oil"
instructions:
- "Pulse coriander, spring onion, garlic in food processor until minced fine."
- "Add shrimp, egg, tamari, chili garlic sauce. Pulse a few times to form a coarse paste. Season with salt, pepper. Scrape sides."
- "Pour sesame seeds into shallow bowl."
- "Spread about 55 ml shrimp paste thick over each bread slice."
- "Flip bread slices shrimp side down into sesame seeds, press gently to coat seeds."
- "Cut each slice into quarters triangles on cutting board."
- "Heat oil in wide skillet over medium heat for 4 minutes."
- "Fry half the triangles sesame side down for 3 to 5 minutes until golden and crunchy."
- "Flip, cook other side 1 minute till bread golden."
- "Drain on paper towel. Repeat with remaining triangles."
- "Serve warm with store-bought sweet chili sauce."
introduction: "Shrimp smashed with herbs. Sticky, spicy paste slapped thick on bread. Sesame seeds clutch every bite. Oil crackles when frying. Golden, crisp triangles hit salty, spicy, nutty notes. Fast assembly, faster fry. Deceptively simple. Great snack for crowd or quick start. Swap soy for tamari, less salty. Add ginger to freshen. Heat with chili garlic sauce. You get sixteen munchable nuggets from four bread pieces. Cooling sauce optional but recommended. Fried till just right. Crunch stays. Not soggy. Midweek, weekend, anytime. Crunchy shrimps meet toasted sesame. Kitchen smells right — garlic, onions, coriander. Minimal fuss, maximum bites."
ingredientsNote: "Shrimp must be dry, no water excess or paste turns soupy. Tamari replaces soy for smoother umami without glutens. Garlic halves soften flavor when pulsed into paste rather than minced raw. Mixed black and white sesame seeds add visual contrast and toasty depth versus only white. Fresh coriander stems and leaves for vibrant herbal kick. Spring onion substitutes for mild sharpness and texture. Bread — use rustic white to hold paste, avoid crumbly sandwich styles. Egg binds shrimp and herbs ensuring paste holds on bread during frying. Chili garlic sauce gives spice and pungency; swap for sambal oelek or sriracha if needed. Vegetable oil chosen for neutral frying with high smoke point."
instructionsNote: "Start slow with pulse setting on processor — don’t liquefy shrimp; want coarse texture for bite. Salt near end to control paste moisture. Sesame seeds spread evenly in shallow dish, press bread gently to stick enough but not crush seeds. Triangles sized for easy frying, around 4 per slice. Heat oil thoroughly before frying for crisp, non-greasy crust. Monitor medium heat closely to prevent burning seeds. Flip carefully to keep shape intact. Drain on paper towel for few moments to shed excess oil. Serve fairly hot. Sweet chili sauce ready on side cools heat and adds sticky glaze contrast. Optional extras: fresh lime juice on serving, extra chopped chives. Timing can vary ±2 minutes depending on stove and pan thickness. Controlled flipping avoids breaking triangles."
tips:
- "Use fresh shrimp. Pat dry well. Too much water makes paste soupy. Dry shrimp avoid soggy results when frying. Season shrimp carefully."
- "Pulsing technique matters. First, chop herbs and garlic fine. Add shrimp last. Pulse gently, make coarse. Not too much; retain bite."
- "Egg is crucial. Acts as a binder. Ensures shrimp paste stays on bread. Don't skip this part. Without it, everything falls off."
- "Fry many batches. Fry in oil that's hot but not smoking. Keep medium heat. Fry too fast or slow can lead to soggy bread."
- "Control frying times. Each side should be golden. Adjust time if needed. Monitor closely to avoid burning. Crunch is key!"
faq:
- "q: Can I use frozen shrimp? a: Yes, thaw first. Pat completely dry. Frozen shrimp has more moisture. Watch texture of paste."
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Keep in airtight container. Fridge for day or two. Reheat in oven for crispness. Avoid microwave."
- "q: What if I don't have tamari? a: Soy sauce works well. Use gluten-free soy for similar flavor. Or skip it altogether."
- "q: Any tips for the sesame seeds? a: Coat evenly. Press gently not crush. Can use only white sesame if preferred. Black adds contrast."
