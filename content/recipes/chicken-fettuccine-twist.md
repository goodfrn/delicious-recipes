description: "A creamy pasta dish with tender chicken strips in a cheesy sauce made with creme instead of heavy cream, zested Parmesan swapped for Pecorino Romano, and fettuccine replaced by pappardelle. Butter and garlic provide foundational flavor. Water reserved from pasta cooking to adjust sauce consistency. Elevated timing and heat control keep chicken moist, sauce silky, and pasta al dente. Salt and pepper balance all. A hint of lemon zest adds brightness without overpowering. No eggs or nuts. Four servings."

ingredients:
- "400 g pappardelle pasta"
- "3 skinless boneless chicken breasts, sliced into thin strips"
- "50 ml (3 tbsp) clarified butter"
- "2 cloves garlic, minced"
- "200 ml creme fraiche (35% fat)"
- "150 ml Pecorino Romano, finely grated"
- "Zest of 1 lemon"
- "Salt"
- "Freshly cracked black pepper"
- "Olive oil"
instructions:
- "Fill a large pot with about 4 liters of salted water. Bring to rolling boil before adding pasta. Stir immediately after adding pasta so it doesn’t stick. Cook until just shy of firm bite — about 9-11 minutes depending on pasta brand. Taste frequently from 8 minutes onward. Reserve 150 ml pasta water before draining; set it aside."
- "After draining, drizzle pappardelle lightly with olive oil and toss gently to prevent sticking. Keep warm and off to the side."
- "Meanwhile, heat clarified butter in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers but doesn’t brown yet. Add chicken strips in a single layer—don’t overcrowd. Let them sear for 3-4 minutes undisturbed until golden underneath, then flip. Salt and crack fresh pepper over. Add minced garlic after flipping, cook until garlic is fragrant and slightly softened, about 30 seconds. Remove chicken and garlic with any butter residue to a warm plate. Do not wash the pan."
- "Turn heat down to medium-low. Pour creme fraiche and Pecorino Romano into the same pan. Stir constantly with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula. Watch cheese melt gradually into rich smooth sauce. Scrape browned bits off bottom — those carry deep flavor. Bring to just under simmer; do not boil aggressively or sauce will separate. Add lemon zest now to brighten."
- "Return chicken slices to the sauce pan. Add pappardelle and 60-80 ml reserved pasta water. Toss gently with tongs or fold with wide spoon. The hot pasta absorbs the sauce while water loosens it, giving the right silky texture — add more pasta water sparingly if too thick or sticky. Heat for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently, until chicken is warmed through, pasta coated evenly."
- "Taste cautiously; adjust salt and pepper. If sauce feels too heavy, squeeze a few drops fresh lemon juice to cut richness, stir briefly."
- "Serve immediately on warmed plates. No garnish needed but cracked pepper flakes or a few fresh basil leaves add nice contrast."
- "Common substitution: use half Greek yogurt and half creme fraiche for tang; swap Pecorino for Asiago or Grana Padano if Romano unavailable. For dairy-free, try coconut cream but omit cheese, increase garlic and lemon for punch."
- "Notes: Watch heat during sauce step — too hot causes curdling. Using clarified butter prevents burning compared to regular. Searing chicken dry gives color and locks juices. Pasta water contains starch; critical for sauce texture balance. Do not overcook pasta; it finishes cooking in sauce. Lemon zest, not juice, added early; juice added at end if desired."
introduction: "Creamy chicken pasta. Think beyond heavy cream and Parmesan. Creme fraiche brings subtle tang, richer mouthfeel. Pecorino Romano adds sharper bite and saltiness than Parmesan’s mellow depth. Switching fettuccine for pappardelle means bigger ribbons, more sauce clings. Clarified butter prevents early burning, lets chicken brown deeply without bitterness. Timing on pasta crucial — undershoot chewy for finish in sauce. Reserve starchy water, the secret weapon for sauce texture. Lemon zest wakes up the decadent sauce; acidity built in layers. Garlic added late so it doesn’t turn bitter. Searing chicken in batches seals juices, avoids steaming. This isn’t quick and dirty but establishes solid kitchen fundamentals. No shortcuts on heat and seasoning."
ingredientsNote: "Use quality Pecorino Romano freshly grated for melt and flavor, avoid pre-grated mixes heavy on starch. Creme fraiche can be subbed with crème légère or high-fat sour cream but expect slight tang variance. Clarified butter chosen to tolerate high heat without milk solids burning; can also use ghee or light olive oil. Pappardelle offers broad surface for sauce. If unavailable, use wide tagliatelle or fettuccine but adjust cook times. Fresh garlic is stronger raw; minced finely to distribute flavor evenly. Lemon zest imparts fragrant oils, don’t skip or replace with juice at this stage. Salt on pasta water crucial — boils season pasta internally. Olive oil toss post-drain prevents sticky clumps during assembly."
instructionsNote: "Start pasta in plenty of salted boiling water. Use large pot so water cools less when pasta hits it—prevents clumping. Stir often first two minutes only. Taste often. Watch for chew, not mush; pasta continues cooking in sauce so err on undercooked by one minute. Chicken: Pat dry strips to ensure sear, good Maillard layers. High heat initially, then garlic added when flipping, so it softens but doesn’t burn bitter. Use clarified butter or ghee for higher temp tolerance and cleaner finish. Sauce: Lower heat before adding creme fraiche and cheese to prevent curdling; constant stirring creates creamy emulsion. Scrape pan bits for flavor, emulsify sauce gently. Pasta water starch thins sauce, makes it cling better. Add water incrementally until balance achieved — too much creates watery mess. Finish heating pasta and chicken in sauce briefly to marry flavors but never boil at this stage. Final seasoning—salt, pepper, lemon juice if too rich—done by tasting; avoid oversalting. Serve immediately, sauce thickens as it cools."
tips:
- "Use fresh ingredients. Quality meat better results. Avoid starting with cold chicken. Pat dry first. Helps sear more evenly. Crispness is flavor. Watch chicken closely. Flip once for color not dryness."
- "Reserve pasta water. Starch thickens sauce, creates cling. Use sparingly. Add in small amounts. Too much messes balance. Taste often. Adjust as you go. If it’s too thick, loosen with water."
- "Clarified butter’s best. Higher smoke point than regular. Helps chicken brown without burning. Essential for good flavor. Experiment with ghee, different oils. Just monitor heat closely."
- "Don’t skip seasoning steps. Salt in pasta water crucial. Season chicken, sauce at multiple points. Layering flavor takes strategy. A pinch of salt at each step—helps dish come alive."
- "Final taste check vital. Sauce too rich? Squeeze a bit of lemon juice. Freshness lifts flavors. Balance richness with acidity. Enjoy immediately. Sauce thickens as cools. Timing is everything."
faq:
- "q: How to ensure chicken stays juicy? a: Don’t overcrowd pan. Sear at high temp. Let it rest after cooking. Helps retain moisture."
- "q: Can I use a different pasta? a: Yes, tagliatelle or fettuccine work. Adjust cook times accordingly. Ensure they still have bite."
- "q: What if the sauce separates? a: Keep heat low during cheese addition. Stir constantly. Add reserved pasta water slowly."
- "q: How should I store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. Reheat gently. Add splash of water to revive sauce. Should keep for a few days."
