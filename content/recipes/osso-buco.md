ingredients:
- "65 g (1/2 cup) unbleached all-purpose flour"
- "4 thick veal shanks approx 5 cm each"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) avocado oil"
- "2 medium shallots, minced"
- "400 ml (1 2/3 cups) dry white vermouth"
- "1 can 400 ml (14 oz) fire-roasted diced tomatoes"
- "2 stalks celery, roughly chopped"
- "2 parsnips, chopped"
- "5 cloves garlic, crushed"
- "300 ml (1 1/4 cups) beef stock"
- "40 ml (2 2/3 tbsp) tomato paste"
- "1 tsp dried oregano"
- "1 smoked paprika pod or 1 tsp smoked paprika powder"
- "1 bay leaf"
- "=== Gremolata ==="
- "1 lemon, finely zested"
- "1 small clove garlic, minced"
- "15 g (1/3 cup) chopped fresh Italian parsley"
instructions:
- "=== Braising preparation ==="
- "Position oven rack mid-level. Heat oven to 175 C (350 F)."
- "Spread flour on a shallow plate. Dredge veal pieces lightly, shake excess. Flour helps build crust and thickens sauce."
- "In heavy-bottomed pan, medium-high heat, heat oil. Brown veal shanks evenly—listen for clear sizzle; must form crust, no stewing. Season with salt and pepper. Remove to plate."
- "Lower heat slightly. Toss in shallots, sweat gently until translucent and soft, 3-4 mins. Add garlic near end to prevent burning."
- "Deglaze pan slowly with vermouth, scraping browned bits underneath. Liquid should bubble intensely, reducing 30 seconds."
- "Return veal, nestle veggies around. Spoon in fire-roasted tomatoes, celery, parsnips. Liquids next: beef stock, tomato paste. Stir in oregano, smoked paprika, bay leaf. Salt lightly, pepper well but don’t overdo; flavors will concentrate."
- "Bring sauce to rolling boil on stovetop, cover tightly with lid, transfer to oven."
- "Bake 50 minutes at 175 C. Watch: sauce should be gently simmering, not boiling over."
- "Drop temperature to 160 C (320 F) after initial phase. Continue 1 hour 20 minutes. Veal is ready when tender and shreds slightly under light pressure but still holds shape."
- "Remove from oven. Check seasoning. Sauce thickened, glossy, deep color, taste balance acidic-tart from tomatoes with smoky undertones."
- "=== Gremolata prep ==="
- "Combine lemon zest, garlic, parsley in bowl."
- "Mix thoroughly to release oils but do not bruise herbs too much."
- "=== Serving ==="
- "Plate veal with generous spoonfuls sauce and vegetables."
- "Sprinkle gremolata over top to add bright herbal note and citrus pop."
- "Best with orzo tossed with butter or sautéed zucchini ribbons; add textural contrast."
- "Rest leftovers; flavors deepen overnight."
introduction: "Veal shanks thick, dense, demanding patience. Flour dredged, browned hard – that Maillard crust? Essential seal, locks juices. Not searing fast for color only; steady heat, sizzle singing. Shallots soften slow, garlic added late – garlic burns, bitterness ruins stew. Vermouth instead of wine – sharper, brighter, pulls stuck flavors off pan. Fire-roasted tomatoes replace plain–smokey sweetness deeper. Parsnips swap carrots, lending slight sweetness with earth notes. Smoked paprika subtle fire element; oregano earthiness complements thyme traditionally. Oven bath, steady simmer unlike stovetop frenzy–prevents tough meat, sauce clarity. Gremolata no parsley clump, fine zest pungent aroma, garlic minced small, parsley tender chopped finely. Herbaceous spark against heavy stew, always finish with gremolata. Serve with orzo, buttery squash ribbons for silky, fresh counterpoint. Cool sauce thickness indicates proper reduction, glossy sheen signals balance."
ingredientsNote: "Flour: unbleached works best; bleached flour alters thickening slightly, interchangeable if needed but texture varies. Avocado oil swap: light grape seed or mild olive oil acceptable, avoid overpowering flavors. Veal quality matters for tenderness; if unavailable, bone-in pork shanks or beef shanks can work but adjust cooking time longer for tougher cuts. Shallots instead of onions add sweetness and subtle flavor. Vermouth boosts aroma nuances; dry white wine usable in pinch but vermouth is preferable for intensity. Fire-roasted diced tomatoes replace regular canned to add smoky flavor layer. Parsnips chosen for sugar content and soft texture; carrots substitute but lose slight unique tone. Smoked paprika optional but recommended; adds complexity, give smoky wink without heat. Beef stock homemade preferred; canned works but check salt. Tomato paste tested for a better umami boost than pureed tomatoes. Gremolata: lemon zest crucial–no pith, it’s bitter. Parsley flat leaf, fresh best; curly has less punch. Garlic finely minced balances aroma-spice with brightness. Preparation timing essential; slow sweats prevent burning vegetables and developing flavors."
instructionsNote: "Patience and watchfulness rule here. Flour dredging forms base crust sealing meat. Browning requires medium-high heat, thin layer oil, no overcrowding pan – crowding steams meat rather than browns. Shallots cooked in the same pan pick up remaining fond, forming sweet flavor base. Deglazing with vermouth lifts those browning bits essential for deep sauce aroma. Always bring pot to a boil before oven; this ensures immediate simmer, reducing fluctuations and maintaining temperature control. Cover tight lid to trap moisture; oven's gentler heat softens connective tissues over time without drying. Lower heat after initial phase prevents toughness. Check veal softness with tines of fork; slight resistance means perfect doneness. Sauce should cling to back of spoon, not run thin. Season cautiously; acidity and salt concentrate as liquid reduces. Gremolata adds counterbalance sharpness on top; do not add early or it will cook out flavors. Serving suggestions, orzo and zucchini ribbons add textural variance—always nice with something light. Leftovers develop stronger flavors but reheat gently to preserve texture. Common fail: burning garlic or overcooking veal until falling apart into mush, carefully calibrate times based on oven bells, visual/tactile cues over clocks."
tips:
- "Flour isn't just for flavor, it builds a crust. Dredge veal, shake excess. Too much, and stewing begins. Crust seals in moisture."
- "Searing requires patience. Medium-high heat, don’t overcrowd. Listen for sizzle; should hear it sing. Too crowded? Meat steams."
- "Deglaze with vermouth, not just for flavor. Scrape up those bits from the pan! That’s where depth of flavor lives. Don’t rush."
- "Check for tenderness! Fork should slide in with resistance. If it falls apart, overcooked. Watch closely, gauge by feel."
- "Gremolata adds brightness. Add it at the end. If cooked early, flavors disappear. Zest only, no pith. Pith is bitter."
faq:
- "q: Best way to store leftovers? a: Cool fully, refrigerate in airtight. Or freeze portions. Reheat gently to avoid drying out."
- "q: What to do if veal is tough? a: Check cooking time. Too fast? Lower heat and add broth. Simmer longer can help."
- "q: Can I use something else for veal? a: Yes, bone-in pork shanks or beef work. Just know tougher cuts take longer to tenderize."
- "q: What if I can't find fire-roasted tomatoes? a: Regular canned work. But for a smoky touch, use smoked paprika. Not the same but decent."
