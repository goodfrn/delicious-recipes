slug: "chicken-chorizo-citrus-roast"
description: "Roast a whole chicken butterflied for even cooking. Salted, rubbed with lemon halves to tenderize and flavor. Grelots potatoes and garlic tossed in olive oil, roasting alongside. Cherry tomatoes added mid-roast. Sliced spicy sausage (chorizo replaced with hot smoked sausage for smoke depth) joins near end to crisp. Broiling finalizes that char. Visual cues drive timing—golden skin, soft potatoes, bubbly oil. Citrus juice from cooking liquid brings acidity and moisture at plating. Balanced salt and heat. No gluten, dairy, nuts hassle here."

ingredients:
- "1 whole chicken about 1.5 kg 3 1/4 lb"
- "8 ml 1 1/2 tsp coarse salt"
- "1 lime halved instead of lemon"
- "50 ml 3 1/2 tbsp olive oil"
- "600 g 1 1/4 lb small new potatoes halved if large"
- "4 garlic cloves unpeeled, crushed lightly"
- "500 ml 2 cups cherry tomatoes"
- "115 g 4 oz hot smoked sausage sliced 5 mm 1/4 inch instead of chorizo"
- "Black pepper freshly ground"
instructions:
- "Grill rack middle oven. Preheat oven to 205 C 400 F."
- "Remove backbone from chicken with chef’s knife or kitchen shears. Flatten on baking tray skin up. Dry skin very well with paper towel. Dry skin crisps better; moisture kills the crunch."
- "Salt skin evenly with coarse salt. Rub all over and inside with cut side of lime. Citrus juice breaks proteins, tenderizes. Rest 15 minutes uncovered to start drying skin; absorbs salt, citrus."
- "Meanwhile, toss potatoes and garlic in half olive oil volume. Salt and pepper well. Spread around chicken but don’t crowd; air circulation crisps."
- "Brush chicken skin with 35 ml oil. Pepper liberally. Juice from rested lime holds flavors. Beware under-oiled poultry skin turns leathery; be generous but not dripping."
- "Into oven 28 minutes. Skin changes from pale to golden to amber. Look for bubbly fat around drumstick joints—sign chicken is releasing moisture."
- "Add tomatoes around the chicken. Their moisture steams potatoes briefly, then they roast and wrinkle, concentrating sweet-tart flavor. Continue roasting 50 minutes. Piercing potatoes should show tender, not mushy."
- "Sausage slices scattered at edges, finishing cook with chicken under broiler 6 minutes or until sausage crisps and chicken skin is newspaper-thin crackling."
- "Visual signs: sausage edges curling and black spotted; juices run clear when pierced at thickest part of thigh avoiding bone. Target 80-82 C internal temp if using thermometer; trust squeeze, too—leg should feel loose but not floppy."
- "Remove from oven. Pour juices over chicken and veg. Rest loosely tented 5 to 7 minutes before carving."
- "Serve alongside peppery greens dressed simply with lemon juice and oil. Roast is smoky, bright, textured with punchy citrus, crisp sausage, and soft-yet-crisp potatoes."
introduction: "Butterflied chicken speeds roast time, cooks evenly. Salted well and rubbed with lime halves instead of lemon adds subtle citrus without bitterness. Citrus acid not just for scent—it tenderizes muscle fibers so skin doesn't shrivel and flesh stays juicy. Using hot smoked sausage swaps out standard chorizo spice punch for smoke complexity. Don’t skip drying the skin thoroughly. Moist skin steams, ruining crispness. Roast potatoes alongside in oil until their edges caramelize, garlic adds aromatics that soften and blend in the hot oven. Tomatoes inserted latter half release juices that mingle with chicken drippings, giving layers of flavor and moisture to the pan. Finish with broiling to crisp the meat and sausage surfaces. Serve with quick salad for counterpoint. Timing flexes; trust look and touch over clock."
ingredientsNote: "Chicken butterfly cuts down cooking time and ensures even heat on dark and white meat. Coarse salt needed for surface seasoning and dry brining effect. Using lime here introduces a slightly different citrus profile—less acidic sharpness, more floral zest. Substitute smoked sausage for chorizo when you want more depth and less heat. More or less oil depending on the chicken size and potatoes; don’t drown the pan but coat vegetables well. Cherry tomatoes are best for roasting; sweet, small, burst when hot. Garlic crushed but unpeeled adds subtle aromatics and prevents burning. Black pepper freshly ground; ground too early loses aroma. For gluten-free, double-check sausage ingredients as some brands add fillers. No nuts, dairy, or eggs involved, good for allergies."
instructionsNote: "Removing backbone and flattening chicken (spatchcock) cuts time and helps even cooking; keep skin dry—drying is step no one wants to skip or shortcut. Using citrus halves rubbed directly into chicken adds slight acidic punch; letting rest uncovered lets skin dry and salt penetrate. Layering potatoes and garlic around chicken spreads flavors but leaves room for air flow, avoiding soggy patches. Adding tomatoes halfway through prevents them disintegrating and controls moisture release. Watch bubbling fat by joints and skin color transitions instead of rigid timer dependency: golden skin with wiggly leg signals near done. Last broil step crisps sausage fat and skin; watch closely to avoid blackening. Juices pooled are flavor bombs—pour over at end to add moisture and complexity. Resting is critical—loosens juices, avoids dryness. Chop salad last minute—something acidic or peppery to cut richness."
tips:
- "Chicken's backbone removal—less cooking time. Flattening helps cook evenly; dry skin ensures crispiness. Use paper towels, drying is crucial."
- "Oiling chicken properly is key. Under-oiled skin turns leathery. Generous oil layer is a must, but don't drown it. Base flavors with lime juice."
- "Roasting potatoes with garlic adds flavor depth. Spread them out. Use small new potatoes, halved if large; soft but crisp edges are essential."
- "Watch closely during broiling step. Sausage should crisp without burning. Visual cues: golden skin, bubbling juices. Tempting aromas signal nearing doneness."
- "Rest chicken post-roast—not just for juices but texture. Tent it loosely to keep warmth. Carving too soon loses moisture—patience is important."
faq:
- "q: How to ensure chicken cooks evenly? a: Remove backbone, flatten it first. Dry skin well. Check temperature at thigh—should be 80-82 C."
- "q: What if potatoes are undercooked? a: Return them to oven. Ensure they aren't crowded. Pierce with fork; tender when done—keep checking."
- "q: Best substitutes for hot smoked sausage? a: Any robust sausage will work. Chorizo adds spice; smoked links add depth without too much heat."
- "q: Storage options after cooking? a: Store leftovers in airtight container; refrigerate for up to 3 days. Can freeze for longer—just reheat carefully."
