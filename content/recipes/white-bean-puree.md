ingredients:
- "2 cans of 425 ml (14 oz) white cannellini beans, drained and rinsed"
- "200 ml (7/8 cup) vegetable broth low sodium"
- "1 small carrot, peeled and finely grated"
- "1 teaspoon olive oil"
instructions:
- "Drain and rinse the beans well. Any residual canning liquid ruins texture and flavor; rinse until no foam."
- "Heat your vegetable broth until just simmering, not boiling. Covers the base liquid, brings out subtle sweetness, unlike plain water."
- "Add the grated carrot into the broth; cook for about 4-5 minutes until tender, soft but not mushy. Carrot adds natural sugars and micronutrients."
- "Transfer carrots and broth into the food processor, pour in the rinsed beans. Blitz on medium speed."
- "Stop frequently. Scrape sides. Look for creamy texture; blobs of bean skins should almost vanish but avoid over-processing that heats puree too much."
- "Add olive oil, pulse lightly to incorporate. Fat helps absorb vitamins and improves mouthfeel for baby."
- "If too thick, add a tablespoon of broth or filtered water gradually, test consistency between spoon and lips — neither dripping nor stodgy."
- "Push puree through a fine mesh sieve. This step removes coarse skins and ensures no lumps, important for early eaters."
- "Cool puree on countertop or shallow dish. Stir gently once or twice to release heat evenly. Tiny bubbles and faint bean aroma emerge as it cools."
- "Serve lukewarm or room temp. Store leftovers in airtight container, refrigerate up to 48 hours. Freeze for up to 1 month."
introduction: "Beans, unforgiving in texture if handled wrong. Rinsing canned beans is non-negotiable — that residual gel clogs purees. Carrots sneak in sweetness, soften the profile; babies crave slight natural sugar notes not just bland paste. Broth replaces water — no preservatives, gentle flavor that doesn’t overshadow. Olive oil, though optional, is the fat that rounds texture and aids nutrient uptake. Don’t skip passing through a sieve, no shortcuts. A gritty texture can turn a first feeding nightmare. Timing based on sight, feel, no clock reliance here. Beans too dry? Wet till loose but not runny. Hot? Let baby-friendly temperature cool naturally. The faint hum as processor chops the mixture, smell shifting from dry bean scent to less starchy, sweeter. These sensory cues tell you where you stand."
ingredientsNote: "Canned beans save time but always rinse thoroughly — residual sodium, canning gel affects both flavor and puree texture. Cannellini or navy beans ideal for mild flavor and gentle consistency but great northern or even peeled fava beans can substitute. Water is workable but broth (vegetable or chicken if not vegan) uplifts without overpowering. Carrot adds natural sugar, making the puree more palatable for little ones, and aids digestion with fiber. Olive oil optional, helps fat-soluble vitamin absorption and improves mouthfeel. If olive oil unavailable, substitute with a mild vegetable oil like sunflower or avocado, both neutral in taste. Skip oil if allergies or preferences require. Using fresh steamed carrot rather than raw grated improves digestibility and flavor. Always choose unsalted broth to avoid high sodium — babies unsuited for salt spikes. Straining through fine sieve is essential, baby gums and teeth can’t handle lumps at this stage. If fresh carrot unavailable, a pinch of sweet potato puree works."
instructionsNote: "Precision in texture beats timing. Start with rinsed beans, any stickiness ruins puree smoothness. Heating broth just below boil softens added carrot, unlocking sugars without mush. Gently cook grated carrot in broth on medium low, watch for color change to brighter orange and tender texture — poke with fork to test. Blend beans and carrot in pulses, stop often, scrape down bowl sides. Small batches avoid overheating and breaking skin cells unnecessarily. Olive oil folded in last creates silky finish and improves sensory texture. Slowly adding liquid adjusts consistency; always err on side of thicker puree, thinning incrementally. Push puree through fine mesh for uniform consistency — double strain if needed for ultra-smooth finish. Cool at room temp, stir periodically; visual check for condensation or clumps, those indicate uneven cooling. Avoid reheating more than once, can cause separation and loss of nutrients. Refrigerate in shallow airtight containers to speed cooling and preserve freshness."
tips:
- "Rinse beans thoroughly. No shortcuts on this. Any stickiness ruins texture. Strain till clear. Check for foam while rinsing."
- "Vegetable broth, just warm enough. Not boiling. Softens sweetness better. Carrots cook fast, watch them. Tender but not mushy."
- "Don’t over-process the mixture. Check frequently, scrape sides. Aim for creamy, but avoid heating too much. Use gentle pulses."
- "Add olive oil at the end. It helps with mouthfeel. But if allergies, can skip it. Or use avocado oil instead."
- "Straining is key. Push through fine mesh sieve. No lumps acceptable for babies. Double strain if going for ultra-thin."
faq:
- "q: Why rinse canned beans? a: Removes sodium and goesop. Residual gel gets in the way. Adds off-flavors. Rinse it all, no foam."
- "q: Can I use different beans? a: Sure. Navy or great northern work. Fava beans too. But watch for texture changes."
- "q: What do I do if puree is too thick? a: Add broth slowly, keep testing texture. Aim for baby-friendly not too runny mess."
- "q: How to store the puree? a: Airtight containers in fridge, max 48 hours. Freeze for month. Whenever cool, then seal."
