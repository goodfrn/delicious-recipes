ingredients:
- "675 g lean ground pork (1 1/2 lb), divided"
- "20 ml vegetable oil (1 1/3 tbsp)"
- "130 g shiitake mushrooms sliced (approx 4 1/2 oz)"
- "5 cloves garlic finely chopped"
- "20 ml freshly grated ginger (about 1 1/3 tbsp)"
- "45 ml oyster sauce"
- "30 ml low sodium soy sauce"
- "12 ml toasted sesame oil (about 2 1/2 tsp)"
- "12 ml dark molasses or brown sugar (2 1/2 tsp)"
- "15 ml rice vinegar (1 tbsp)"
- "180 g curly lettuce leaves (about 4 cups)"
- "3 scallions thinly sliced"
- "1 medium carrot cut julienne"
- "15 g fresh mint leaves"
- "40 g roasted cashews crushed (replace peanuts)"
- "Chili garlic paste or chili oil to taste"
instructions:
- "=== Pork and Mushroom Mix ==="
- "Heat half vegetable oil in large nonstick skillet or wok over high heat. Use only enough oil to coat, avoid frying. Add half ground pork, break apart quickly with wooden spoon or spatula. Sear until pork changes color and tiniest edges caramelize, 7-8 minutes depending on stove. Lift out pork with slotted spoon, drain excess fat if needed. Set aside. Repeat for remaining pork with rest of oil."
- "Return all pork to skillet, push to side. In cleared space, toss in shiitake slices. Let sit undisturbed briefly until caramelized underneath, 4-5 minutes total. Stir mushrooms once edges are crisp and darkened. Add garlic, grated ginger, stir 1 minute more till fragrant. Don’t burn garlic; watch closely."
- "Mix everything in skillet. Stir in oyster sauce, soy sauce, molasses or brown sugar, rice vinegar, toasted sesame oil. Should thicken quickly to syrupy, glossy coating. Stir often, reduce heat to medium-low if too fast or darkening too much. Taste and adjust salt, sweet, acid balance. Pepper if wanted. Sauce clings to meat and mushrooms evenly. Texture should be sticky, not watery."
- "=== Assembly and Serving ==="
- "Arrange lettuce leaves on platter — wash and spin dry well beforehand to avoid sogginess. Set out scallions, julienne carrot, fresh mint leaves (sub cilantro if unused), crushed roasted cashews. Heat chili garlic paste or chili oil nearby. Everyone builds own wraps."
- "Scooping pork mixture with spoon, pile into lettuce cup; top with scallions, carrot, mint, nuts. Add chili paste for heat if desired."
- "=== Notes and Tips ==="
- "Brown meat in batches. Crowding pan means boiling, not searing. Meat should color and crisp in spots; don’t just stir to grey. Shiitakes gain flavor by contact with hot pan—do not stir constantly."
- "If no shiitakes, substitute cremini or button medium-firm mushrooms but expect less earthiness."
- "Molasses gives rustic depth instead of sugar. Brown sugar works too."
- "Toasted sesame oil added at end for aroma, not cooking oil."
- "If no fresh ginger, frozen grated works fine—press water out to avoid dilution."
- "Roasted cashews instead of peanuts for nut allergy considerations, still crunch and oily richness."
- "For oil choice, neutral veg oil like canola is best: avoids overpowering flavors, withstands high heat."
- "Using rice vinegar adds brightness; lemon juice can substitute but use sparingly to avoid over-acidity."
- "Wipe pan between batches if burnt bits build up—will affect sauce flavor and color."
- "Serving raw lettuce keeps contrast: temperature, texture, and freshness, key to this dish."
introduction: "Half-cooked pork waiting for color; shiitakes sweat but want that char. Oils sizzle sharp. Garlic and ginger smell sharp, punch through the fat. Balance sweet, salty, sour; a quick glossy coat means heat is right. Lettuce crisp. Assemble at table, fast and messy hands. Crunch from nuts, herbal freshness from mint or cilantro. Chili oil for the brave. Learn to read the skillet. When pork sears, garlic finishes, mushrooms crisp beneath the meat. No drowning in sauce. Quick, sharp, tactile. No fuss stacks of flavor. You’ve got a burner and a bowl — now cook. No overcooking, no limp leaves."
ingredientsNote: "Ground pork broken down in batches; over-crowding kills texture. Shiitakes deliver umami and texture—replace with cremini if you must, but lose some chew and earthiness. Garlic and ginger absolutely fresh to avoid bitterness; pre-chopped frozen works, drain excess moisture. Toasted sesame oil must finish the dish for aroma. Brown sugar replaced molasses for gentle sweet depth. Rice vinegar brightens; lemon juice can work but sparingly. Cashews nod to peanut allergy sensitivity, still provide satisfying crunch. Keep lettuces chilled, dry, and intact, or wraps turn limp and sad. Vegetable oil with high smoke point key, avoid olive oil here. Make something rustic, textured, and balanced."
instructionsNote: "Sear pork in two batches to develop crust—crowding causes steaming and pale meat. Lift with slotted spoon; drain excess fat to avoid greasy final. In same pan, mushrooms cook slowly without stirring first, developing deep color and crisp edges. Garlic and ginger added late—burnt garlic spoils dish. Combine meats and mushrooms, then add sauces: oyster, soy, brown sugar/molasses, sesame oil, vinegar. Cook sauce down to thick syrup, not watery. Taste often—adjust sugar or vinegar as needed. Serve immediately with crisp lettuce and fresh toppings, never pre-assemble or leaves get soggy. Encourage assembling at table, brings contrast of hot, cold, crunchy, soft. Use aroma and crispness as doneness signals, not strict timer. Wiping pan between batches if bits scorch keeps flavors clean. Simple tools, big flavor."
tips:
- "Sear pork in batches; too packed means steaming. Want nice caramelization. Break it up quickly with a spatula. Perfect texture needs room."
- "Use neutral oil with high smoke point; canola or veggie oil work. Olive oil? Too heavy and will smoke up. Perfect for meat searing."
- "Don’t skip on fresh garlic and ginger. Dried just won’t cut it. Fresh delivers the aroma and sharpness; frozen? Press out moisture."
- "Have roasted cashews instead of peanuts? Good choice for allergies. They crunch nicely and offer oiliness. Adds rich texture to dish."
- "Let diners assemble wraps at the table; keeps the crunch. Plate lettuce leaves dry and cold, soggy leaves ruin the experience."
faq:
- "q: How do I keep leftovers fresh? a: Store pork in airtight container. Lettuce wraps? Best eaten fresh, but if you must? Keep lettuce separate."
- "q: What if I can’t find shiitakes? a: Substitute with cremini or button, but flavor changes. Shiitakes offer unique earthiness; consider using more spices."
- "q: Too salty sauce? a: Add a splash of rice vinegar or sugar; it balances the saltiness. Taste it while cooking; adjust on the fly."
- "q: Can I make this ahead? a: Yes, cook and store pork mix in fridge. Assemble later. But lettuce? Needs to stay fresh right before serving."
