ingredients:
- "Fondue Cheese Mix==="
- "10 ml (2 tsp) arrowroot powder"
- "300 ml (1 1/4 cup) unsweetened evaporated milk"
- "3 ml (1/2 tsp) chipotle hot sauce"
- "1 ml (1/4 tsp) onion salt"
- "300 ml (1 1/4 cup) sharp aged gouda shredded (110 g)"
- "Garnish==="
- "60 ml (4 tbsp) finely chopped celery leaves"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) toasted pecans chopped (optional)"
- "4 celery stalks cut into thin sticks about 1/2 cm thick"
- "Breadsticks or crisp crackers broken into smaller pieces"
- "Freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Heat pot medium. Whisk arrowroot into evaporated milk cold, then stir constantly just before boiling. Mixture thickens to a creamy veil coating spoon."
- "Off heat add chipotle sauce, onion salt. Stir in gouda gradually, wipe sides to prevent clumps. Melt fully, glossy sheen."
- "Pour into glass bowl; cover surface tightly with plastic wrap to prevent skin. Leave to cool 10 minutes, check texture — should be thick but not set."
- "Refrigerate 2 1/2 to 3 hours until firm but scoopable. Longer chill firmer cheese."
- "Toast pecans dry pan until fragrant. Chop pecans and celery leaves finely."
- "Spoon 15 ml into each shot glass. Sprinkle celery leaves and pecans on top. Grind black pepper fresh."
- "Stick 3 celery batons in each glass upright. Arrange leftover celery sticks separately with assorted breadsticks."
- "Serve cold but not icy; cheese melts softly on contact. Crunchy sticks for dunking balance dense, creamy cheese."
- "Adjust chipotle quantity or swap with smoked paprika. Add more arrowroot for firmer set, less for soft dip consistency."
introduction: "Shots of creamy cheese, chilled after slow melting to just slick gloss. Celery—not just a garnish but crunch central, fresh and slightly bitter, cuts through fat. Toasted pecans bring toasted sweetness and texture contrast. Chipotle sauce adds subtle smoky kick. Gouda replaces cheddar; more melt-smooth less sharp, smoky complexity. Arrowroot instead of corn starch for cleaner flavor, smoother hold. Timing less about minutes, more about feel—surface smooth, thickened but not stiff. Wrap plastic tight, no skin ruin. Celery sticks skinny enough to scoop but sturdy. Simple, snackable. Plates or trays. Fast hands stirring. Technique tricks matter here — heat control, stirring rhythm, ratios critical or cheese breaks down. Clear execution, solid fallback: more milk if curdle. Ditch walnuts if allergic or don’t want bitterness, pecans soften. Breadsticks broken, rustic. No fuss, all focus on standout texture combinations. Practical, reliable, tested."
ingredientsNote: "Arrowroot powder as thickener is more neutral than cornstarch, no smell, less cloudiness. Keeps cheese glossy, silky. Evaporated milk working better than fresh milk for creaminess and body; full fat preferred. Chipotle sauce introduces smoky heat without overpowering sharp cheese flavors. Onion salt gives subtle umami background. Substituting gouda and smoked mozzarella for cheddar shifts profile—softer melt, more rounded flavor. Use fresh celery leaves for aroma and color, avoid dried herbs here; freshness critical. Nuts toasted gently on dry pan enhance nuttiness without burning. Pecans swap smoothly for walnuts, less bitterness, more soft buttery notes — great if extra crunch wanted. Celery sticks should be fresh, crisp, peeled from lines to prevent stringiness, slices thin to scoop cheese easily but maintain crunch and firm hold. Breadsticks broken unevenly highlight rustic look and easy grabbing. Store more cheese blend refrigerated tightly covered to avoid drying or skin forming."
instructionsNote: "Whisk arrowroot into evaporated milk cold to avoid clumps. Heat medium, stir continuously to prevent scorching and to coax thickening—visual cue is slow thickening, coats back of spoon. Remove from heat before cheese goes in. Adding cheese off direct stove heat prevents separating and graininess; stir gently until fully melted. Cover surface immediately with plastic wrap to block skin film and oxidation. Let cool at room temp until just warm to touch, no condensation below wrap. Chill minimum 2.5 hours, longer for firmer hold. Portioning into shot glasses once chilled means smooth scooping without mess. Garnish with celery leaves and toasted pecans just before serving to maintain crispness and aroma. Black pepper right before serving brings fresh spice impact. Celery sticks inserted last for best presentation; too early softens sticks. Reheating not recommended—cheese firm but melts quickly at room temp for tactile dip. If cheese breaks or lumps, splash cold milk in immediately, whisk vigorously off heat to reclaim smooth texture. Avoid overheating which toughens mixture. Constant stirring key during thickening step to avoid scorching. Homemade breadsticks or rustic crackers add crunch balance—store-bought work fine but avoid overly sweet or flavored varieties that clash."
tips:
- "Watch the heat; whisk arrowroot cold into milk. Heat gently—no lumps. Right texture, creamy just before boiling. Stir constantly; thickens beautifully."
- "Cheese off direct heat. Chipotle sauce adds kick; blend in onion salt for umami. Gouda melts well; keep stirring until fully incorporated. No clumps."
- "Texture check after cooling; still slick, thickened but soft. Refrigerate—minimum 2.5 hours. More chilling means firmer cheese, adjust as needed."
- "Chop celery leaves and pecans fine. Toast pecans just enough to breathe aroma; avoid burning. Fresh leaves brighten flavor, enhance presentation."
- "For presenting shooters, celery batons fit neatly. Use broken breadsticks, crispy crackers for dipping. Offer alongside shooters, balance is key."
faq:
- "q: Can I alter cheese? a: Gouda works best. Swap for other melts like mozzarella; cheddar pulls differently. Texture might change but fine."
- "q: What if cheese seizes? a: Milk splash helps. Stir vigorously off heat to rescue mix. Add more arrowroot for firmer set; adjust butter."
- "q: Storage tips? a: Keep covered tightly; avoid skin on cheese. Refrigerate. Use within 3 days for best texture. Can chill longer for firmer."
- "q: Want a less smoky flavor? a: Adjust chipotle. Try smoked paprika for less warmth but still some flavor depth. Always taste in layers."
