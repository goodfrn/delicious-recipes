ingredients:
- "900 ml (3 3/4 cups) sliced leeks, white and light green parts only"
- "250 g (9 oz) shiitake mushrooms, stems removed, sliced"
- "40 ml (2 2/3 tbsp) butter"
- "25 ml (1 2/3 tbsp) buckwheat flour"
- "900 ml (3 3/4 cups) vegetable broth"
- "400 ml (1 2/3 cups) oysters with juice"
- "6 slices sourdough bread, toasted or not"
- "400 ml (1 2/3 cups) Gruyère cheese, shredded"
- "Smoked paprika, a pinch"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Heat butter in large pot over medium-high heat. Add leeks and shiitake mushrooms. Cook stirring often until most liquid evaporates and veggies brown slightly, about 18-22 minutes. Season with salt and pepper."
- "Sprinkle buckwheat flour over veggies. Stir constantly for 2 minutes to cook out raw taste. Slowly pour in vegetable broth while whisking to avoid lumps. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, simmer 6 minutes until thicker."
- "Add oysters with their juices. Stir gently. Remove from heat, covering pot to keep warm."
- "Set oven rack near top and preheat to broil. Place soup into 6 ovenproof bowls evenly."
- "Top each with a slice of sourdough. Sprinkle shredded Gruyère over bread and soup surface. Dust lightly with smoked paprika."
- "Broil bowls in oven until cheese melts, bubbles, and turns golden, about 7 to 10 minutes. Watch closely to prevent burning."
introduction: "Leftover oysters from the holiday table? Something quick that doesn't waste those briny treasures. Forget the usual onion & mushroom base. Leeks lend sweetness, shiitakes add earthiness. Buckwheat flour thickens with a hint of nuttiness. Vegetable broth keeps it lighter, different. Sourdough replaces rustic bread for a tang. Gruyère packs flavor, melts with a stretchy, golden crust. Smoked paprika adds something unexpected — subtle smoky warmth to each bite. No waiting days to enjoy them again. Soup finished in under an hour. Heat builds, flavors meld, your kitchen smells like something warm and cozy but with a twist. Dive in hot and cheesy."
ingredientsNote: "Leeks swapped in for standard onions for a sweeter, softer base. Shiitake mushrooms bring woodsy notes that go deeper than plain button mushrooms. Buckwheat flour, gluten-free and nutty, thickens while changing texture, so soup isn’t too pasty. Vegetable broth makes it lighter and avoids overpowering seafood taste from chicken broth. Sourdough bread lends a tangy, chewy bite beneath melted Gruyère, sharper and less gooey than Emmenthal. Smoked paprika is not traditional but adds aromatic warmth without heat. Oyster quantities reduced slightly to balance with the new veggies and flavors. Salt carefully adjusted, since oysters can be salty."
instructionsNote: "Start low and slow with vegetables to coax out water slowly and develop subtle caramelization—no rushing. Stir flour thoroughly to avoid clumps; the buckwheat flour needs a bit longer over heat. When adding broth, do so gradually while whisking to keep smoothness. Simmer to meld flavors and thicken soup. Oysters added last to avoid overcooking and keep tender. Remove pot from heat to prevent rubbery bivalves. Assemble bowls carefully; sourdough slices soak some broth but remain distinct under the cheese. Broiling is quick and demands attention; cheese browns fast and can burn, so watch closely and remove cheese once golden and bubbling. Serve hot immediately."
tips:
- "Start by cooking leeks slowly. Use medium heat. They need time to sweat and caramelize flavors. Avoid rushing this step. Brown bits create depth. Shiitake mushrooms offer earthy tones. Sauté till they're reduced. Important texture balance with oysters later."
- "Add buckwheat flour thoughtfully. Mix in well. No clumps allowed. Use a whisk for smoothness. Gradually pour in vegetable broth. Stir continuously. This avoids lumps. Bring to a soft boil. Thicker soup is key. A careful simmer melds flavors."
- "Oysters go in last. Remove pot from heat to prevent rubbery texture. Stir gently. You want tender oysters. Assembly is crucial. Place sourdough on top. Cheesy layer must cover soup. Broil at top rack. Pay attention. Don't let it burn."
- "Use smoked paprika sparingly yet it adds depth. A pinch or two is enough. For fresh herbs go with dill or thyme but keep it subtle. Adjust salt after adding oysters. They can be salty. This ensures balanced flavors in soup."
- "Experiment with cheese type. Gruyère offers sharpness and stretch. But try aged cheddar too. Or mix cheeses for unique flavors. When broiling, watch closely. Cheese can turn quickly. Remove when bubbly and golden brown. Serve hot for best experience."
faq:
- "q: Can I use different mushrooms for this recipe? a: Yes absolutely. Button mushrooms work. Or even portobello. Each brings different tastes. Experiment with favorites, or whatever is available. Just cut into slices."
- "q: How can I store leftover soup? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. Best within three days. Reheat on stove, not microwave if possible. Delicate textures revive better. Keep some bread separate if possible."
- "q: What if I can't find buckwheat flour? a: Regular flour is an option. Some gluten-free options also exist. Tapioca could work but it changes texture a bit. Use what you have. Just adjust amount for thickening."
- "q: How do I know when the soup base is ready? a: Look for slightly thickened texture. It should coat the back of a spoon. Patience is key here. Simmering lets flavors infuse. Check seasoning before adding oysters."
