ingredients:
- "130 g (3/4 cup) small diced kohlrabi, peeled"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) diced pickled jalapeños, drained"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) mayonnaise"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) fresh lemon juice"
- "7 ml (1 1/2 tsp) Dijon mustard"
- "6 ml (1 1/4 tsp) finely minced capers"
- "2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) prepared horseradish"
- "1 small shallot, minced"
- "24 oysters, scrubbed and rinsed"
instructions:
- "=== PREP REMOULADE ==="
- "1. Combine diced kohlrabi and pickled jalapeños in a mixing bowl for crunch and subtle heat contrast. Add mayonnaise, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, minced capers, horseradish, and finely minced shallot. Season with cracked black pepper generously but no salt yet; capers and mayo add plenty. Stir until every morsel coated; texture should be creamy but chunky, not soupy."
- "2. Cover and let macerate 12–18 minutes. The acid from lemon and jalapeños softens kohlrabi slightly—watch for the shift from rigid crunch to a bit of give but still lively. Taste; adjust mustard or horseradish for punch here before shellfish joins."
- "=== SHUCK AND SERVE ==="
- "3. Meanwhile, tackle oysters. Scrub shells well to avoid grit. Work slowly; use an oyster knife at hinge point. Safety tip: Thick towel under hand keeps blade from slipping against tough shells. Pry open, slice muscle cleanly. Retain half shell with oyster nestled inside."
- "4. Arrange oysters on serving platter layered with crushed ice. Key is to keep oysters very cold—prevents toughness and dullness. Plates should stay chilled. Discard any shells that smell off; fresh oysters should smell briny, like a sea breeze."
- "5. Spoon remoulade generously atop each oyster. Should sit atop oyster without sinking or turning watery—if too loose, chill remoulade longer or reduce mayo slightly next time."
- "6. Serve immediately. Look for juice shimmer around oysters; indicators of freshness. Provide lemon wedges or micro herbs for optional garnish. Invite diners to savor brine followed by remoulade’s crisp tang and subtle heat."
- "=== CLEANUP & TIPS ==="
- "7. Remnants: Save oyster juice—excellent in a Bloody Mary or shellfish broth. Kohlrabi or jalapeño substitute: celery root or mild pickled pepper works fine if fresh kohlrabi unavailable; jalapeño adaptable with mild pepper to avoid overpowering heat."
- "8. Timing note: macerate over 12–18 minutes based on kohlrabi texture preference. Keep oysters cold until last second; warm oysters toughen and flatten flavor."
- "9. Common mistakes: over-shucking leads to juicy loss; too much horseradish masks subtle brine; skip salt in remoulade—it upsets seasoning balance given capers and pickles."
introduction: "Oysters raw, slick with the ocean, hanging half in their shells, waiting for something crisp and bright. Forget that heavy sauce sludge. Think crunchy kohlrabi for texture, pickled jalapeños for a hit of heat. Mayonnaise base, sure, but cut with lemon juice—sharp, fresh. Capers add salt and brine echoing the oysters themselves. Shallot's subtle punch rounds it out. The trick: keep the oysters ice-cold. Warm oysters turn rubbery. Macerate the remoulade just enough so veggies soften a little but retain snap. You’re aiming for contrasting textures, a balance of creamy, acidic, crunchy, briny. Serve on crushed ice. The oysters should glisten, smell like the sea, beckon. No fluff, no fuss—just solid technique and attentive timing. What kills the dish? Warm shellfish and sloppy sauce. What saves it? Precision in prep and service."
ingredientsNote: "Kohlrabi makes an unexpected stand-in for celery root here, offering a fresh, crisp bite that doesn’t melt into mush. Pickled jalapeños bring controlled heat—swap in any pickled mild peppers if heat’s a no-go, but don't skip the acid and crunch altogether. If mayonnaise is off-limits, try an oil-based aioli or vegan mayo but reduce quantity slightly as they differ in texture. Capers are crucial—don't substitute with olives; their flavor is sharper and saltier, which pulls the remoulade together. Shallots add gentle aromatics, no raw onion harshness. Always scrub oyster shells well. Small tip: work over a bowl to catch juice for use in sauces or cocktails—waste not."
instructionsNote: "Work methodically. Prep remoulade first so it has time to marry flavors and soften veggies but maintain crunch. Taste after maceration; adjust acid and spice. Oyster shucking demands respect and patience; don't rush or force shells open or you risk injury and broken shells. Crushed ice bed not just for show—cold keeps oysters firm and fresh-tasting. Load oysters fully with remoulade but don’t drown; the sauce must stay thick enough to contrast the tender shellfish beneath. Serve immediately to enjoy peak textures. Watch for off smells from oysters—discard any that don’t smell clean or sea-fresh. Keep everything chilled until served to avoid rubbery shells and dull flavor. Cleanup tip: reserve oyster liquor—you'll thank me later."
tips:
- "Maceration - not too long; 12-18 minutes tops. Keeps kohlrabi crunchy. Test texture before you move on."
- "Oyster shucking - tools matter. Knife with good grip. Towel is key for safety. Always work gently. Avoid rupturing flesh."
- "Layered ice - essential for oysters. Keep them cold. Ice displays freshness, plus it stabilizes texture. Glisten and snap."
- "Remoulade consistency - it's crucial. Should sit thickly on oyster. If too loose, either less mayo or chill longer."
- "Always scrub shells - grit is not welcome. Clean shells say fresh seafood. Catch any oyster liquor; it’s a treasure."
