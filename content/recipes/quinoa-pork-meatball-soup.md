ingredients:
- "=== Meatballs ==="
- "110 g (1/2 cup + 1 tbsp) quinoa, rinsed well, drained"
- "210 g (7 oz) lean ground pork"
- "20 g (1/3 cup) panko breadcrumbs"
- "1 large egg"
- "3 scallions, finely chopped"
- "1 clove garlic, minced"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) toasted sesame oil"
- "10 ml (2 tsp) Sriracha sauce"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) tamari soy sauce"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) rice wine vinegar"
- "60 ml (1/4 cup) hoisin sauce"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) vegetable oil"
- "=== Broth ==="
- "3 scallions, halved"
- "2 slices of ginger about 2.5 cm (1 inch)"
- "2 cloves garlic, crushed"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) vegetable oil"
- "2 liters (8 cups) chicken stock"
- "20 g (3/4 cup) fresh coriander stems"
- "2 packets (200 g each) precooked udon noodles"
- "200 g (2 1/2 cups) mung bean sprouts"
- "20 g (3/4 cup) fresh coriander leaves"
instructions:
- "=== Meatballs ==="
- "Bring salted water to a rolling boil first. Cook quinoa until tender but not mushy, about 13 minutes. Drain thoroughly in a fine mesh sieve; rinse under cold running water to stop cooking. Squeeze out extra water by pressing lightly between paper towels or clean kitchen cloth. Moisture control key—wet quinoa ruins meatball texture."
- "Combine drained quinoa, pork, panko, egg, scallions, garlic, sesame oil, and Sriracha in a bowl. Season generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Mix until uniform but don't overwork, or meatballs toughen."
- "Oil your hands lightly—this prevents sticking. Form balls with about 15 ml (1 tbsp) of mixture each, rolling firmly but gently to maintain shape. Place on a plate. Pop into fridge to firm up for minimum 20 minutes; helps hold together during cooking."
- "Whisk soy sauce, rice vinegar, and hoisin sauce in small bowl; set aside as glaze."
- "=== Broth ==="
- "In large pot over med-high heat, warm vegetable oil. Toss in scallion halves, ginger slices, and crushed garlic. Stir frequently until fragrant and edges turn golden, 3–4 minutes. Watch for burning garlic; bitter if scorched."
- "Add chicken stock and coriander stems. Raise to a boil, then reduce to gentle simmer for 8 minutes. Season lightly with salt and white pepper; the broth needs seasoning but rely on finishing salt for balance. Strain out aromatics with skimmer and discard to keep broth clear and clean-tasting."
- "Return broth to boil. Place udon noodles in gently—avoid stirring to prevent breaking strands. Cover, lower heat to keep warm without boiling."
- "=== Cooking Meatballs ==="
- "Heat vegetable oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Brown half meatballs first batch, turning to brown evenly, about 4 minutes total. They should get a caramelized crust. Add remaining meatballs once the first batch is golden."
- "Pour reserved hoisin-soy glaze over all meatballs. Toss gently to coat evenly, stirring until glaze starts to thicken and stick to balls, about 1.5 to 2 minutes. Watch close here—caramelization happens fast and can burn."
- "=== Assembly ==="
- "Divide noodles and broth among bowls first, then spoon meatballs over. Scatter mung bean sprouts and fresh coriander leaves on top. The crunch and herb brightness counterbalance rich meat and umami broth."
- "Serve steaming hot. Squeeze lime wedge if you have one for extra lift."
- "=== Tips & Substitutions ==="
- "If pork unavailable, ground chicken or turkey works but decrease cooking time to avoid dryness. For gluten-free, substitute panko with gluten-free breadcrumbs or finely crushed rice crackers. Sambal can be replaced by Sriracha or chili garlic sauce but adjust heat to preference."
- "Don’t skip rinsing quinoa after cooking; starch residues cause gummy meatballs. For deeper flavor, try adding soy-sesame oil mix or a drop of fish sauce to the glaze. If broth tastes flat, a splash of lime juice or a pinch of MSG wakes it up. Keeping aromatics whole helps remove easily; minced aromatics cloud broth."
- "If noodles stick or melt apart, reduce boiling time or soak separately in hot water before adding to broth. Always reserve some glaze sauce in pan for spooning over before serving."
- "Store leftover meatballs separately from broth to keep skin firm. Reheat broth gently; don’t boil noodles again or they get mushy."
introduction: "Starts with meatballs holding moisture balance—quinoa rinsed and pressed keeps texture firm. Pork mingling with umami ingredients, glaze that sticks but not cloying. Broth built on aromatic base, long simmer but no bitterness. Udon noodles added gently to keep strands whole. Beansprouts and fresh coriander finish with punch. All components layered, prepared in steps that demand attention to moisture, heat control, timing. Careful caramelization of meatballs delivers savory notes plus contrast to clear broth. A subtle heat from chili, acidity from rice vinegar balances richness. No fluff here, straight down to what works and why."
ingredientsNote: "Quinoa quantity adjusted slightly—moisture affects binding in meatballs heavily; eccentric cooks discard rinsing step at own risk. Toasted sesame oil vital for nutty aroma; omit only if allergy or pungent taste a problem, replace with mild olive oil. Hoisin and mirin combined; mirin replaced here by rice vinegar for slight acid lift and tweak in flavor profile, adjusting quantity down to avoid excess sweetness. Changed sambal for Sriracha to shift heat profile. Onion greens bumped from 2 to 3 for sharper freshness. Broth aromatics simplified—garlic crumb count increased for better nose, less risk of burning. Vegetables substituted mung bean sprouts for slightly sweeter and more tender. Adjust quantities thoughtfully—too much of any wet ingredient ruins texture, too little makes dry, crumbly meatballs. Make sure chicken broth is low sodium so you control salt. If unavailable, vegetable broth is fine but flavor lighter. Fresh coriander stems not just for discard—they add depth during cooking, but pulling out keeps broth clear."
instructionsNote: "Quinoa cooking time slashed slightly from 15 to 13 minutes to avoid over-softening; rinse crucial to stop cooking and remove starch. Press quinoa tightly to shape firm meatballs—excess water equals loose balls, falling apart during sear. Form balls gently but firmly. Refrigeration before cooking must be minimum 20 minutes; this tightens texture. Aromatics fried gently; no quick high heat to avoid bitter burnt garlic. Broth simmer purpose is flavor extraction without cloudiness—straining aromatics key. Noodles added at last minute, no stirring; retaining structure. Meatballs browned in batches—not crowded pan—to keep crust. Glaze poured over at end, stirring carefully for caramelization. Visual cues dominant—crust must darken evenly but not blacken; sauce should thicken and coat meatballs glossy but not too sticky. Final bowl assembly layering preserves textures—soupy noodles and broth first, meatballs hot top, crisp sprouts, fresh coriander leaves last. Work fast to keep hot but not soggy. Keep leftovers separated; reheat gently, avoid overcooking noodles or meatballs get dry and broth dull."
tips:
- "Moisture control key when cooking quinoa. Overcook it? Meatballs will fall apart. Rinse after cooking to remove starch. Less starch equals better binding."
- "Chop scallions finely. Keeps texture nice, bright flavor bursts. Use fresh garlic, no powdered stuff. Fresh brings aroma and punch. Don't skip frying aromatics slowly."
- "If using chicken instead of pork, reduce cooking time. Taste change will happen. Monitor temp closely, dry meat's a risk. Better safe than sorry."
- "Udon noodles? Add them gently to the broth. No stirring. Breakage happens. Waiting to add at end keeps them intact. They'll soak up flavor, serve nice."
- "For leftovers, separate meatballs from broth. Storing them together leads to softness. Reheat gently. Don't boil them again, or meatballs turn dry. Broth? Keep it warm."
faq:
- "q: What's the best way to prepare quinoa? a: Cook till tender, but don’t mush it. Drain, rinse. Dry quinoa promotes firmness. Looks good, feels right."
- "q: Can I swap pork for turkey? a: Yes but keep an eye on cook time. Turkey dries out quicker. May need oil or something rich. Helps retain moisture."
- "q: Broth isn't flavorful enough? a: Splash of lime juice can wake it. Consider MSG. Freshness matters, herbs bring it. Strain out older stuff if needed."
- "q: Difficulties with meatballs? a: If they're falling apart, too much moisture. Less egg, more panko next time. Tighter form helps hold when browning."
