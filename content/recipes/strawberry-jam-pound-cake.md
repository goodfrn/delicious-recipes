slug: "strawberry-jam-pound-cake"
description: "Dense, rich pound cake swirled with fresh and cooked strawberry components. Combines fresh strawberry puree and diluted strawberry preserves for moisture and flavor. Uses a Bundt pan starting cold oven method to promote even rising. Incorporates vegetable oil instead of shortening for subtle softness, while swapping lemon extract for almond for a nutty layer. Slightly reduced sugar, boosted vanilla, and added a pinch of baking powder to lighten crumb. Glaze with powdered sugar, fresh strawberry puree, and lemon zest for a tangy finish."

ingredients:
- "2 cups hulled fresh strawberries"
- "3/4 cup strawberry jam"
- "2 sticks unsalted butter softened"
- "1/4 cup vegetable oil"
- "1 1/2 cups granulated sugar"
- "4 large eggs"
- "3 cups all-purpose flour"
- "1/2 teaspoon baking powder"
- "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
- "1/2 teaspoon almond extract"
- "1/4 teaspoon salt"
- "Powdered sugar glaze: 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar; 1/4 cup fresh strawberry puree; 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract; 1 teaspoon lemon zest"
instructions:
- "Wash strawberries, hull, and pulse in food processor to puree. Reserve 1 cup for cake batter, the rest for glaze and set aside."
- "Warm jam in microwave about 40 seconds or until just melted but not boiling. Let cool to lukewarm."
- "Grease and flour a 12-cup Bundt pan thoroughly. Spray-plus-flour method works fine if pan is well-seasoned and nonstick. DO NOT preheat oven yet."
- "Cream butter, vegetable oil, and sugar with a hand or stand mixer for 4-5 minutes until light and fluffy. Paddle attachment helps. Scrape sides once midway."
- "Add eggs one by one. Mix well after each. Scrape bowl edges again to avoid unmixed pockets."
- "Sift flour and baking powder together. Measure accurately by spooning into cup and leveling."
- "Alternately add flour and strawberry puree to the creamed mix: 1 cup flour, mix; half puree, mix; 1 cup flour, mix; remaining puree, mix; last cup flour, mix. Do not overbeat after dry ingredients enter—just until combined."
- "Stir vanilla and almond extracts into cooled melted jam with salt. Slowly combine this into batter, folding gently to avoid deflating air."
- "Add a few drops of red food coloring if a pink hue is desired. Blend without overmixing."
- "Even batter in prepared pan. Smooth the top with spatula for even bake. Put pan in cold oven, set temperature to 320 to 330°F (325 average). This slow rise matters—avoids cracking, promotes tender crumb."
- "Bake around 1 hour 10 to 1 hour 20 minutes. Start checking at 1 hour 5 minutes. Toothpick testing near center—clean but moist crumbs signal doneness. Edges pull slightly away from pan’s sides."
- "After baking, cool in pan 10 minutes max. Invert onto wire rack or plate. Cool fully before glazing."
- "For glaze, whisk powdered sugar, reserved strawberry puree, vanilla, and lemon zest. Stir vigorously until cohesive; may appear grainy then smooth out. Drizzle over cooled cake in lines or zigzags with a spoon."
- "Let glaze set 10 to 15 minutes before slicing."
introduction: "Strawberries mashed and jam liquefied. Cake batter, slippery and thick, carrying fresh and cooked berry flavors deep inside moist crumb. No preheated oven—start cold. Bundt pan prepped, slick with butter, dusted in flour. Butter and vegetable oil whip white and creamy, sugar dissolving with friction. Eggs fold in, one by precious one, ensuring emulsification. Flour and strawberry puree folded alternately, mixing the dry and wet in layers. Melting jam brings jelly sweetness and color, enriched by vanilla and almond extracts layering fragrance. Bake slow, steady. Toothpick comes out clean but crumb still moist. Glaze tart with zest. Fresh, practical, kitchen-tested cake. Pull out your Bundt pan. Let strawberries speak."
ingredientsNote: "Using vegetable oil versus shortening gives a softer, less dense crumb, though traditional recipes use shortening for structure. Almond extract replaces lemon for a subtle nutty aroma to play off strawberries. Baking powder added sparingly here helps counterweight the typical density of a pound cake. Measuring flour correctly matters—spooning and leveling prevent a gummy cake. Jam must be gently melted just to liquefy, avoid overheating which dulls bright flavor and thickens messily. Fresh strawberry puree adds freshness; jam adds concentrated berry sweetness and moisture. Glaze uses lemon zest for tang instead of original lemon extract to brighten and balance rich sweetness, stirring until coarse powder melts into glaze—this takes patience."
instructionsNote: "Skipping preheating means slower oven heat rise, letting the cake warm gradually for less cracking and a tender crumb. Cold oven start requires patience—don’t open door too early or often or risk collapse. Creaming butter, oil, and sugar thoroughly incorporates air, the foundation of rise. Adding eggs slowly maintains emulsion; rushing leads to curdling. Alternating flour and puree mixes dry and wet evenly without overmixing, which tightens gluten and toughens cake. Melted jam adds berry flavor deeply; cooled to lukewarm to preserve egg structure in batter. Baking at 325°F steady heat ensures caramelization without drying. Testing for doneness by toothpick is standard but watch for moist crumbs; too dry means overbaked. Cooling briefly in pan helps cake hold shape; fully cool before glazing so glaze won't run off."
tips:
- "Use ripe strawberries. Freshness matters for the puree. Mash well. Jam must be warmed, but not boiling. Liquefy just enough; avoid deep cooking."
- "When creaming butter, vegetable oil, and sugar, keep beating till light. Air is key for rise. Don't rush adding eggs. One at a time; mix well."
- "Ensuring flour is fluffed before spooning helps. Sifting with baking powder is not just a step. It aerates flour; crucial for lightness."
- "Alternating adding flour and puree keep the batter from overmixing. Prevents tough texture that can ruin. Just mix until combined. Finished looks thick."
- "Baking in cold oven; 320 to 330°F. Helps prevent cracking. You want gradual heat. This method means patience, but crumb is worth it."
faq:
- "q: How long can I store the cake? a: Store in an airtight container. Up to four days on counter; seven in fridge. Note moisture's key."
- "q: What if the cake cracks? a: Cracking often from too hot oven. Next time, watch heating method. Slow rise matters."
- "q: Can I replace butter? a: Yes, margarine works. But it changes flavor slightly. Still moist with oil though."
- "q: My glaze is too runny. a: Add more powdered sugar gradually. If too thick, little milk or more puree. Adjust gradually."
