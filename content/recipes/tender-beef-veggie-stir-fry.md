ingredients:
- "8 oz flank steak, thinly sliced against grain"
- "1 tsp baking soda"
- "4 tbsp water for marinade"
- "1 tbsp rice vinegar"
- "2 tsp soy sauce"
- "2 tsp cornstarch"
- "4 tbsp vegetable oil, divided"
- "3 cloves garlic, smashed and minced"
- "1 inch fresh ginger, minced"
- "1 cup broccoli florets"
- "1 cup shredded carrots"
- "1 cup red bell pepper, sliced"
- "3 stalks green onion, chopped"
- "2 tbsp shaoxing wine or dry sherry"
- "Salt and white pepper to taste"
- "For Sauce"
- "3 tbsp soy sauce"
- "1 tbsp oyster sauce (sub hoisin if unavailable)"
- "1 tsp toasted sesame oil"
- "1 tsp sugar"
- "1/4 cup beef broth or water"
- "1 tsp cornstarch mixed with 1 tbsp cold water slurry"
instructions:
- "=== Marinate and soften beef ==="
- "Combine flank steak slices with baking soda and 4 tablespoons water in a bowl. Use hands to mix until water absorbs and meat feels tacky, about 3 minutes. Baking soda breaks down proteins for tender texture. Don’t skip or beef will be tough."
- "Add rice vinegar, soy sauce, and cornstarch. Toss well, coat every slice. Set aside uncovered at room temp for 25-35 minutes, or cover and chill overnight (longer marinate intensifies flavor but remove from fridge 20 minutes before cooking)."
- "=== Prepare sauce ==="
- "Whisk soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, sugar, and broth in small cup until sugar dissolves. Set aside."
- "=== Cook beef in hot wok ==="
- "Heat wok over high heat until a drop of water sizzles and evaporates instantly. Add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. Swirl to coat."
- "Add half the beef, spread out. Leave undisturbed 90-120 seconds so surface browns well. Flip slices, sear other side another 90 seconds. Medium-rare with brown crust; resist stirring or poking too soon or you lose sear."
- "Transfer beef to bowl. Repeat with remaining oil and beef batch. Avoid overcrowding or beef will steam, lose that crust."
- "=== Stir-fry vegetables ==="
- "Reduce heat to medium-high. Add splash more oil if needed. Toss in garlic, ginger, stir fast until aromatic—30 seconds. Follow immediately with broccoli, carrots, bell pepper, green onion whites."
- "Cook stirring for ~3 minutes until veggies brighten and just start to soften but retain bite. Snapping crunch is key. If pan looks dry or bits sticking, deglaze with a splash of shaoxing wine to lift fond flavors."
- "=== Bring beef back, add sauce ==="
- "Return all beef to wok. Pour sauce over beef and veggies. Stir occasionally, letting cornstarch thicken sauce filling the wok with glossy sheen. Sauce thickens in about 6-8 minutes but watch closely; if too thin, add more cornstarch slurry gradually."
- "Taste. Adjust salt or pepper here. Balanced salty, sweet, a little umami needed."
- "=== Serve fast ==="
- "Scoop onto bowls over steamed rice or toss with noodles. Garnish extra green onion tops or toasted sesame seeds if handy. Hot and fresh—don’t let it sit or sauce gums up."
- "Cleanup tip: soak wok with warm water immediately to avoid stuck cornstarch."
introduction: "Too many run flank too fast, tough as boots. Baking soda’s secret weapon—breaks protein bonds, softens edges, triggers juicy chew. Marinating steps not just flavor but texture, crucial for stir-fry beef. Vivid veggies add that crunch, cooking fire should roar yet keep crisp. High heat, fast action—searing locks juices, don’t crowd pan or beef will steam and toughen. Odd splash of shaoxing? Depth in a flick. Sauce thickens with cornstarch, coats everything like a light glaze, silk around muscle and fiber. Toss with steamed rice or your favorite noodles—no overcooking or gloss fizzles out. Timing is feel, look, sound—not just the clock. Store leftovers separately to maintain crunch and don’t scrap off sauce; reheat gently."
ingredientsNote: "Flank steak stands up to quick, hot wok but slice thin against grain to avoid chewiness. If flank AWOL consider sirloin or skirt steak, similar lean cuts. Baking soda softened meat works better than long marinade with acid alone. Soy sauce can swap tamari for gluten-free or less salty profile. Oyster sauce makes sauce savory umami; hoisin adds sweet twist but less depth. Shaoxing wine optional; dry sherry or mirin with splash of vinegar stand in. Veggies chosen to contrast beef texture—carrot sweet crunch, bell pepper for color, broccoli adds rugged bite. Green onions tossed in early for sweetness, garnish with green tops for freshness. Cornstarch slurry at finish thickens but if sauce too thick, thin with splash of broth or water. Vegetable oil preferred neutral heat but peanut or canola OK. Garlic and ginger must brown quickly without burning; adjust heat if smoke too much."
instructionsNote: "Start marinading beef with baking soda, not after—too late and tenderizing fails. Using hands to massage wets beef with baking soda water crucial to break down fibers. Marinate uncovered at room temp for under 40 minutes avoids over-softness or fridge longer. Sauce components mixed before cooking avoids lumps or raw sugar grains. Wok hot enough when a splash of water pops sharply. Searing beef undisturbed crucial—resist stirring or poking for crust. Divide beef into batches to keep pan hot and beef surface dry for browning, don’t overcrowd. Quick cook vegetables on medium-high, toss rapidly to avoid soggy, keep colors bright and snap fresh. Deglazing lifts fond stuck on surface, deepening flavor. Final sauce thickening occurs gradually, stir gently so cornstarch doesn’t clump. Add slurry incrementally if needed. Wait until sauce glazes everything before plating. Serve immediately, stir-fries suffer from sitting—sauce thickens, veggies wilt. If you have leftover beef, store meat and veggies separately to keep texture. Reheat gently stirring in splash of broth or water to loosen sauce."
tips:
- "Hot wok is key; drop water should sizzle hard. Oil swirls fast, prevents sticking. Baking soda is non-negotiable for tender beef. Don’t skip it. Touch beef while marinating for tackiness, part of softening."
- "For sauce mix, ensure broth is warm. Sugar dissolves faster. Glaze beef with sauce, then watch for that glossy surface, thickens slowly. If sauce runs thin, cornstarch slurry fixes issues on the spot."
- "Veggies can swap—carrots for zucchini, bell peppers for asparagus; flexibility is key. Snapping crunch matters in stir fry. Heat sears beef, quick toss maintains texture. Never overcrowd; keep moisture in check."
- "Garlic and ginger hit hot wok first; stir quickly, aim for aroma. Lovely smell should fill kitchen; colors need to brighten, staying crisp. If pan looks dry? That’s a cue for broth splash."
- "Leftovers separate for texture; beef and veggies don’t play nice together when reheated. Add water for steam when warming. Reheat on low to maintain quality. Keep pantry stocked for quick fixes."
