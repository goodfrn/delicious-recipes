ingredients:
- "180 g fresh scallops, diced rough"
- "2 medium fire-roasted tomatoes, seeded and diced"
- "200 ml zucchini diced small"
- "Grated zest and juice of 1 lime"
- "25 ml avocado oil"
- "50 ml chopped fresh cilantro"
- "Salt and fresh cracked black pepper"
- "Lime wedges for glass rims"
- "Coarse sea salt for rimming glasses"
- "4 margarita glasses"
instructions:
- "Rough chop scallops. Texture matters—too fine makes paste, too big means uneven 'cooking' in acid."
- "Seed tomatoes carefully; juice dilutes acid balance if left in. Dice to uniform small cubes."
- "Replace cucumber with zucchini; raw zucchini adds slight bite and less water so ceviche stays bright."
- "Mix scallops, tomatoes, zucchini in a bowl. Add lime zest and juice immediately to 'cook' the scallops with acid."
- "Drizzle avocado oil over mix; a neutral oil with subtle butteriness, replaces olive oil’s stronger flavor and avoids bitterness."
- "Add chopped cilantro. Salt and pepper the mix—start light; acid brightens saltiness quickly."
- "Let rest 7-10 minutes. Watch scallop edges turn opaque and firm. Too long mushy, too short raw and flat."
- "Meanwhile, prep glasses. Rub lime wedge on rims, then dip into coarse salt spread on a plate. Salt clings better with lime oils active."
- "Spoon ceviche into glasses, careful not to include excess juice to avoid sogginess."
- "Serve immediately. Aroma of fresh cilantro and lime punch through. Texture contrast between firm scallops and crisp zucchini noticeable."
- "Leftover ceviche acid breaks down quickly; if needed, store under airtight container on top of ice pack to avoid soggy scallops."
introduction: "Scallop ceviche done right demands respect to timing, texture, and acidity. Not just throwing ingredients into acid and hoping. Scallops must be diced just so—not mush, not chunky. Acid cooks surface proteins fast. Too long? Rubber siding. Too short? Raw mush. Fire-roasted tomatoes add necessary smoky depth replacing regular raw—keeps it vibrant but adds umami. Zucchini swaps cucumber because it holds shape better—avoid watery mix that dilutes sharp citrus. Lime zest plus juice layers flavor dynamic. Avocado oil lends creaminess without overbearing olive oil bitterness. Salt on glass rims isn’t for show. Citrus oil and salt together punch nose and first sip. Resting time crucial. Peaks at precisely opaque scallop edges and freshness in veggies. Play with it—don’t just watch clock."
ingredientsNote: "Quantity adjustments important. Cut scallops down 25% to keep every bite firm and manageable when diced. Fire-roasted tomatoes chosen for their smoky aroma—buy canned or roast fresh; skin and seeds removed to avoid bitterness and extra liquid. Zucchini swapped in avoids soggy texture common with cucumber and controls water release. Avocado oil preferred to olive oil due to milder taste and higher smoke point, handling warm kitchen better. Cilantro fresh and finely chopped gives herbal contrast; stems add bitter notes, so strip leaves clean. Salt application on glass rims tightens citrus impact; coarse sea salt works best, avoids clumping. Lime wedges serve dual purpose: glass preparation and bonus zest squeeze. Use freshest scallops available; any sign of fishy odor means skip. If scallops unavailable, firm white fish like halibut or mahi-mahi possible but texture and timing differ—watch carefully."
instructionsNote: "Start chopping scallops first; texture dictates success. Overmincing equals glue-like ceviche; keep pieces about 1 cm chunks. Remove tomato seeds fully to stop watery puddle forming—pulp can water down acid's punch. Mixing order? Always acid with seafood immediately so proteins coagulate evenly—not banging in acid 10 minutes later after all else. Rest time—opt for 7-10 minutes, no more. Visual cue: scallop edges turn from translucent to opaque with slight firmness. If you smell ammonia, stop; scallops gone bad. Prepping rims last—lime oils activate salt adhesion. Avoid soaking glasses or wet rims; dehydrate with towel if needed before salting. Serve fast—ceviche continues to 'cook' and may become rubbery if left out. Leftover? Keep refrigerated, but texture deteriorates within hours. Always taste final seasoning; acid tempers salt but over-salting hard to fix after. Balance acid, salt, and oil to taste, not just following measurement blindly."
tips:
- "Chop scallops about 1 cm chunks. Texture is crucial. Too fine, it becomes mush. Too large means uneven cooking. Visual cues matter."
- "Fire-roasted tomatoes bring depth. Regular ones dilute flavor. Remove seeds; they add unnecessary liquid. Uniform dice size—necessary for even mixing."
- "Zucchini swaps cucumber. Less water—prevents mush. Adds nice crunch. Cut into small pieces for proper blending and vibrant look. Preserve texture."
- "Rest ceviche 7-10 minutes. Scallop edges should turn opaque, giving firmness. Too long, mushy texture; too short, raw. Timing is key."
- "Prep glass rims last. Rub lime first to help salt stick. Coarse salt gives desired saltiness; avoids clumping. Make sure rims are dry."
faq:
- "q: Best way to choose scallops? a: Freshness is key; no fishy smell. Look for translucent, firm texture. Bad scallops go limp, shiny."
- "q: What's the deal with resting? a: It allows flavors to blend. Too much time can lead to mush, timing is essential. Stay vigilant."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep in airtight container over ice pack. Changes happen quickly; texture falls apart. Better fresh."
- "q: Alternatives for scallops? a: Firm white fish like halibut works in a pinch. Watch cooking times and textures; adjust as needed."
