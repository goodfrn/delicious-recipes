ingredients:
- "=== Wheat and Kale ==="
- "140 g (3/4 cup) wheat berries, rinsed"
- "70 g (2 cups) de-stemmed kale, roughly chopped"
- "1 medium red onion, thinly sliced"
- "=== Dressing ==="
- "60 ml (1/4 cup) full-fat Greek yogurt"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) grapeseed oil, plus more for salad"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) apple cider vinegar"
- "10 ml (2 tsp) whole grain mustard"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) agave syrup"
- "1 clove garlic, minced"
- "=== Salad additions ==="
- "175 g (1 cup) halved red seedless grapes"
- "35 g (1/3 cup) toasted pecans, roughly chopped"
- "40 g (1/3 cup) shredded sharp cheddar cheese"
instructions:
- "=== Wheat and Kale ==="
- "1. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Add wheat berries and cook 60-65 minutes. Test by biting — wheat berries should be tender with slight chew but not mushy."
- "2. At last 3 minutes of cooking, throw kale and sliced onion into pot. The kale wilts but retains fresh bite; onions soften lightly, lose sharpness but stay present."
- "3. Drain everything promptly in a colander. Run under cold water to stop cooking and cool slightly. Shake off well; too wet wilts salad and dilutes flavors. Transfer to large bowl."
- "=== Dressing ==="
- "4. Meanwhile, whisk Greek yogurt, grapeseed oil, apple cider vinegar, mustard, agave, and garlic in small bowl until creamy and homogenous. Taste. Adjust vinegar or sweetener for balance."
- "=== Salad assembly ==="
- "5. Add grapes and toasted pecans to wheat concoction. Drizzle a tablespoon grapeseed oil for silkiness. Season with salt and cracked black pepper; toss gently but thoroughly."
- "6. Sprinkle shredded cheddar evenly over top. Drizzle dressing over salad just before serving to prevent wilting."
- "7. Serve at room temp or chilled briefly. Leftovers keep well but store dressing separately if possible to avoid sogginess."
introduction: "Wheat berries are overlooked but worth the slow simmer. Dense, nutty. Gives texture no ordinary grain can match. Kale chopped fine, doesn’t get overcooked — tossed right at end, just wilted enough to lose toughness but still hold bite. Swap sweet green grapes for sharper red ones to add zing and pop visually. Pecans toast up deeper and crust well, a better alternative if walnuts aren’t your thing. Cheddar instead of feta shifts from tangy to creamy, less salty. Greek yogurt dressing carries acid with mustard grainy texture, garlic punches through but never overwhelms. Honey replaced by agave syrup for cleaner sweetness. The oil presence, subtle, slicks salad without grease pooling. Layering flavor, exact textures. Timing, temperature matter — no mush allowed."
ingredientsNote: "Wheat berries need soaking for faster cooking — overnight if you want, but not mandatory. If pressed for time, quick boil 10 then simmer slow with lid cracked. Don’t rush cooking or you get chewy hard centers. Kale—always remove stems; they stay fibrous and bitter even after cooking. Slice onions thin, raw sharpness cuts when hot wheat hits them, smoothing their intensity. For nuts, pecans or almonds work well toasted, walnuts can be bitter if over-toasted. Cheddar chosen for milder melt versus feta’s crumbly punch but can swap back if preferred. Yogurt 0% works, but full-fat adds richness. Agave syrup is a neutral sweetener alternative to honey; maple syrup adds earthiness if you prefer. Oil can be grapeseed, sunflower—neutral flavor; olive oil too strong, may clash with mustard."
instructionsNote: "Cooking wheat berries demands checking texture, not clock-driven. Should give a slight resistance, not break apart. Add kale and onions last 3 minutes to preserve texture contrast. Don’t overcook kale; watch color shift to deep green, no dulling. Chill wheat salad quickly under cold water to arrest heat, firm texture. Dressing whisked cold before assembly provides brightness; if yogurt is cold, whisk vigorously to avoid lumps. When tossing, add oil to coat wheat and prevent dryness; oil also carries flavor and mouthfeel. Cheese sprinkled last to control melting—avoid mixing to prevent clumping. Serve fresh; salad holds 1-2 days but pour dressing only when serving to avoid sogginess. Leftovers reheat awkwardly so best cold."
tips:
- "Wheat berries, soak overnight for tenderness. Or boil then simmer with lid cracked if short on time. Don't rush cooking or get hard centers. Keep checking texture by biting."
- "Kale needs stems removed; they stay tough, bitter in salad. Chop fine for best results. Add onions 3 minutes before draining wheat. Hot wheat mellows raw onion sharpness."
- "Toasting nuts deepens flavor. Get pecans nice and golden for best results. Walnuts can become bitter if overdone. Cheese—cheddar instead of feta for creamy, mild take."
- "Greek yogurt dressing should whisk until creamy, cold ingredients prevent lumps. Can use 0% yogurt for lower fat but richness fades. Adjust acid and sweet to your taste."
- "Best to mix salad just before serving. Drizzle dressing last minute, keeps it fresh. Store leftovers separate; soggy salad isn’t good. Serve cold or at room temp."
faq:
- "q: How to cook wheat berries? a: Rinse first; boil in salted water. About 60 minutes until tender, slight chew. Drain, run cold water over to stop cooking."
- "q: Can I skip agave syrup? a: Use honey if preferred. Maple syrup works too. Adjust sweetness to taste. Be cautious, too much sweetness overpowers dressing."
- "q: What if I have leftover salad? a: Store in fridge sans dressing. Lasts 1-2 days. Reheat awkwardly so better cold. Add fresh toppings if reheating too."
- "q: Can I use different cheese? a: Sure, feta can go back in. Or use another mild cheese. Adjust flavors; taste balance. Experiment, see what you like best."
