- "Salt and pepper"
- "=== Sauté of chicken ==="
- "1 small onion, thinly sliced"
- "40 ml (2 1/2 tbsp) olive oil"
- "4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts cut into strips"
- "60 ml (1/4 cup) chopped green olives"

- "5 ml (1 tsp) dried thyme"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) fresh mint, chopped"
- "Zest of 1 lemon"
instructions:
- "=== Couscous ==="
- "1. Bring vegetable broth and olive oil to a boil in a small pot. Salt and pepper."
- "2. Remove from heat, stir in couscous. Cover. Let swell 7 minutes. Fluff with fork."
- "=== Sauté of chicken ==="
- "3. In a large non-stick pan, heat half oil over medium-high. Sauté onion until soft but not brown, about 3 minutes."
- "4. Add chicken strips. Brown on all sides over high heat. Season with salt and pepper."
- "5. Stir in green olives and garlic. Cook 1-2 minutes till fragrant."
- "6. Add chopped sun-dried tomatoes and thyme. Bring to a quick simmer. Cook 3-4 minutes until chicken fully cooked."
- "7. Taste. Adjust salt and pepper as needed."
- "8. Plate couscous first. Spoon chicken mixture on top. Sprinkle fresh mint and lemon zest."
introduction: "Chicken strips in a pan. Sizzle. Aromas hit. Onion softening, chicken browning quick. Green olives swapped in for color and bite. Sun-dried tomatoes punchy, not watery diced ones. Thyme replaces the usual oregano, earthier. Mint thrown at the end for fresh snap. Couscous soaked in veggie broth, no butter, olive oil instead. Fluff light, flavors punchy. Lemon zest punches aroma to life. No dairy, no nuts, no eggs. Quick-ish. Bold-ish. Serves four hungry mouths, or two very hungry."
ingredientsNote: "Broth swap changes base flavor, vegetable broth lightens and suits mint well. Olive oil in couscous keeps texture loose. Sun-dried tomatoes packed flavor, drier than canned diced, better punch here. Green olives more briny, less fruity, contrast to kalamata deep but milder. Thyme stands up better to sun-dried tomatoes than oregano’s sharper tone. Garlic bumped-up for garlicky edge. Mint instead of basil adds a cool fresh twist instead of herbal. Lemon zest—plenty of perfumes. Adjust salt carefully as olives sun-dried add salty notes too."
instructionsNote: "Couscous quick soak, timing slightly longer to get just tender grains, watch moisture. Onions don’t brown too much, just soften, maintaining sweet edges. Chicken strips high heat seared fast for browned crust, juicy interior. Add olives and garlic last for pungent aromatics, keep garlic bite but no burn. Sun-dried tomatoes added late to avoid drying out. Simmer just enough to finish cooking chicken—4 minutes tops at medium heat. Mint tossed on top off heat preserves freshness and green color. Lemon zest sprinkled last moment. Serve immediately for best texture, couscous and chicken not resting long or grain clumps."
tips:
- "Use high heat for chicken. Brown strips quickly. Crispy outside. Juicy inside. Don’t crowd the pan. Cook in batches if necessary. This ensures even heat. Flavors meld better."
- "Adjust flavors carefully. Salt level varies. Olives add saltiness. Thyme can enhance taste. Garlic must not burn. Add late for strong punch. Lemon zest brightens everything. Just sprinkle before serving."
- "For couscous, don’t over soak. Exact timing matters for fluffiness. 7 minutes covered. Watch moisture closely. Use fork to fluff. Loosen grains helps presentation."
- "Sun-dried tomatoes distinct flavor. Better than standard canned. Adds depth to dish. Garlic needs attention. Too much heat burns it. Cook until fragrant. Avoid bitterness."
- "Add mint last. Keeps color and freshness. Integral for brightness. It contrasts olives' saltiness. Zest from lemon is aromatic. Just a touch enhances dish. Serve immediately for best texture."
