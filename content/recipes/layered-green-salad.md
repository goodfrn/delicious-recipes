ingredients:
- "=== Dressing ==="
- "30 ml olive oil"
- "25 ml walnut oil"
- "20 ml white wine vinegar"
- "10 ml wholegrain mustard"
- "Salt and freshly cracked black pepper"
- "=== Salad ==="
- "600 ml Boston lettuce, roughly torn"
- "600 ml baby rocket leaves"
- "600 ml lamb's lettuce (mâche)"
- "600 ml watercress"
instructions:
- "=== Dressing ==="
- "1. Whisk olive oil with walnut oil in a bowl. Add white wine vinegar. Spoon in grainy mustard. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Mix thoroughly so dressing emulsifies."
- "=== Salad ==="
- "2. Arrange the four greens separately in a large mixing bowl. Gently toss together for even distribution."
- "3. Drizzle half the dressing over the greens, toss lightly. Add remaining dressing, taste, adjust salt and pepper."
- "4. For an elevated presentation, use tongs or two forks to build the salad upwards on plates or a serving dish, creating layers of leaves standing tall."
- "5. Serve immediately to preserve the freshness and crispness of the leaves."
introduction: "Greens piled high. Crunchy, peppery tones. Dressing sharp with vinegar and mustard. Nutty oil cutting richness, a touch of bitterness from watercress alongside mild Boston lettuce. Baby rocket’s peppery kick contrasts soft mâche. Sharpness balanced with subtle sweetness from walnuts. Dress then toss but keep it gentle. Layers for height add drama, give bite and crunch in every forkful. Quick to pull together, no cooking. Farm-to-table freshness in minutes. Serve chilled, crisp. Vegan, gluten-free. Freshness the star here. A salad to wake up tired meals. It doesn’t drown the greens, just cloaks them lightly, keeps them lively. Assembly is playful, rustic, no fuss."
ingredientsNote: "Reduce the quantities by roughly a third for fewer servings or scale up for crowds. Walnut oil here replaces some olive oil for a richer, earthier nuttiness. Dijon mustard switched to wholegrain for texture and a milder zing. Leaves trimmed for bite-sized ease; Boston lettuce swapped from 3 cups to 2 and a half for a better balance with peppery leaves. Salt and pepper always to taste depending on vinegar sharpness. Use fresh, tender greens preferably from local markets, washed thoroughly and dried well to keep dressing from diluting. Oils should be good quality to impact flavor. Vinegar can be swapped for champagne vinegar for a subtler acidity if preferred."
instructionsNote: "Combine oils first, then vinegar so emulsification is easier. Add mustard last to avoid curdling. Season in small increments and taste frequently. Toss greens gently to avoid bruising delicate leaves. Best use wooden salad forks or tongs to build volume and avoid crushing. Serve promptly once dressed to prevent sogginess. Presentation is elevated by stacking rather than flat spread for salad visual. No chilling necessary before serving but keep ingredients cold until last moment for crispness. Can prepare dressing ahead and refrigerate for a day. If salad sits too long post-dress, leaves wilt quickly; toss again with fresh greens if needed. Experiment with adding toasted nuts or dried fruit on top for texture contrast after plating."
tips:
- "Use fresh greens. Farmers' market is best. Keep greens dry. Wilted greens ruin everything. Dressing should coat but not drown. Adjust quantities. Add nuts or seeds. Experiment with flavors."
- "Quality oils matter. Avoid cheap brands. Good olive oil enhances flavor. Walnut oil adds depth. Control oil-to-vinegar ratio. Test different combinations."
- "Temperature affects texture. Chilly greens are crisp. Keep ingredients cold until serving. Avoid dressing too early. Sogginess is a risk. Serve immediately for best results."
- "Dijon mustard is not the only choice. Wholegrain adds texture. Might change flavor profile. Taste regularly while mixing. Adjust seasoning as needed. Sharpness can vary."
- "Presentation matters here. Elevate salad. Stack layers on plates. Create height with leaves. Use tongs or forks. Avoid crushing the greens. It’s all about visual appeal."
faq:
- "q: What if I can’t find all greens? a: Swap with similar tender greens. Spinach or arugula could work. Adjust textural balance though. Not exact, but still good."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate tightly. Will lose crispness. Keep dressed and undressed separate if possible. Re-toss with fresh greens if needed."
- "q: Can I make dressing ahead? a: Yes. Store in fridge. Up to a day in advance is fine. Shake or whisk well before using. Emulsification could change."
- "q: What goes well on top? a: Nuts or seeds. Maybe add dried fruits like cranberries too. Cheese optional, but not vegan. Mix textures for interest."
