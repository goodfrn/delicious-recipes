ingredients:
- "180 ml (3/4 cup) orzo pasta"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) sun-dried tomatoes in oil, diced"
- "1 small shallot, finely minced"
- "1 clove garlic, finely minced"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) reserved sun-dried tomato oil"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) chicken broth or vegetable broth"
- "20 ml (1 tbsp) chopped flat-leaf parsley"
- "sea salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Drop orzo in all at once. Stir gently to prevent sticking. Cook until just tender but still firm to bite. Watch closely; orzo can go past al dente quickly. Drain in a fine sieve. Set aside. Avoid rinsing — you want the starch to help bind sauce later."
- "Drain sun-dried tomatoes carefully, reserving 45 ml of the oily marinade. Dice tomatoes into small pieces to distribute intensity evenly — skip big chunks."
- "Heat the reserved oil in a sauté pan over medium heat. Toss in the shallot. Stir often until translucent and softened, about 3 minutes — no browning; you want sweetness extracted, not bitterness."
- "Add garlic, stir immediately, cook 30 seconds until fragrant but not dark. Garlic burns fast; keep eyes on it, smells change quickly."
- "Fold in diced tomatoes, stir well to coat with oil and aromatics. Splash the broth in. The liquid should start to bubble gently — avoid rapid boil, reduce heat to low."
- "Simmer the mixture until thickened and reduced by roughly half. Watch carefully; sauce should coat back of spoon but still be loose enough to spread through pasta easily."
- "Add drained orzo, toss thoroughly but gently. Let pasta warm through and soak up sauce for 2-3 minutes. Stir in parsley last moment. Taste. Season with salt and pepper—sun-dried tomatoes can already be salty; err on side of caution."
- "Serve immediately. Orzo continues to absorb moisture; if reheating, add splash broth or water and stir gently to prevent dryness."
introduction: "Grain shapes like orzo tempt home cooks and pros alike. Tiny, rice-shaped pasta that can vanish at the table if you don’t watch it. Sun-dried tomatoes bring concentrated chew and a hint of tang balanced by rich oil—a great shortcut to deep flavor without turning the kitchen into a mess blasting fresh tomatoes. The shallot and garlic form a controlled aroma base — sweat just enough to pull out the sweetness without risking raw sharpness or bitter sings. The key is reserve that oil. Don’t toss it. It’s stripped of tomato but packed with essence, perfect for starting the sauce. Broth adds moisture—and a simmer breaks down those robust bits into silk, pulling everything together. Parsley at the end injects brightness, lifting the heavier flavors, no heavy cream needed here. It’s humble but loaded with technique, showing what a tight kitchen rhythm looks like."
ingredientsNote: "Reduced orzo quantity by 25% to tighten the ratio between pasta and sauce for more intense flavor each bite. Swapped pomodorini tomatoes for classic sun-dried, diced smaller—uniform textures matter when tossing cold or reheating leftovers; big chunks void consistent mouthfeel. Shallots preferred over onions: milder, cook down smoothly giving sweetness without puddling or sharp spikes. Garlic kept as is for pungency balance. Oil reserved from tomatoes critical: avoid sub cheaper oils that lack that subtle tomato essence. Broth cut by a quarter from original — no drowning the pan, concentrate flavor for sticky shine on grains. Parsley halved — avoid overshadowing those earthy tomato notes. Salt and pepper remain flexible: always taste and add in stages. Keep listing changes handy to adjust pantry substitutions like vegan broth or fresh herbs."
instructionsNote: "Start pasta in high salted water; timing is everything. Orzo cooks fast—under 9 minutes max. Al dente means slight resistance, no pasty softness. Reserve well. Don’t rinse: starches bind sauce better during finishing stage. Dice tomatoes smaller than usual; smell volatility drops after chopping fine. Use oil from the jar — that’s your flavor launchpad; heat gently to avoid smoking. Sweat shallots till translucent, not brown—brown equals bitterness here and silencing layers of complexity. Add garlic late to preserve fragrance—30 seconds max. Stir constantly. Splash broth carefully; simmer low so reduction is slow and controlled—hiccups in heat can scorch or underdevelop flavors. Reduction cues: sauce thickens visibly; no watery puddles. Stir in pasta for a gentle mingle; avoid aggressive stirring that breaks orzo. Final parsley stir adds color and fresh bite, cut before serving to retain vibrancy. Salt after tasting sauces fully reduces risk of over-salting; sun-dried tomatoes already punch salty. Watch texture; leftovers may need stirring with liquid addition to refresh pasta, avoid drying out. Efficient, fast, flavorful."
tips:
- "Cook orzo al dente; watch it closely. Check texture; firm bite key. Drain but don’t rinse. Starch helps sauce cling well. Reserve energy, avoid overcooking."
- "Sun-dried tomatoes add intense flavor. Cut into smaller pieces for even distribution. Mince shallots finely; they cook faster, add sweetness without bitterness."
- "Heat oil gently. Add shallots first; aim for translucent. Garlic goes in after; too long burns. Smell the difference. Timing matters to keep aromas intact."
- "Splash in broth slowly; avoid boiling. Control the heat for even reduction. Watch for thickening; should coat spoon nicely, not watery. Stir regularly."
- "Finish with parsley; vibrant color and freshness. Cuts through heavier flavors. Taste often, adjust salt carefully; sun-dried tomatoes can be salty already. Stay cautious."
faq:
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Store in fridge. Add splash of broth; keeps moisture. Orzo absorbs quickly. Check after reheating; add more liquid if too dry."
- "q: What if broth runs out? a: Use water with bouillon, adjust flavors. Or, try vegetable broth; adds depth. Keep salt in mind; adjust towards the end."
- "q: Can I swap the pasta? a: Yes, use acini di pepe or small couscous instead. Adjust timing; smaller shapes cook faster. Keep an eye on texture."
- "q: Trouble with mushy orzo? a: Start with salted boiling water. Timing is crucial. Overcooking leads to gluey mess. Drain immediately; don't rinse."
