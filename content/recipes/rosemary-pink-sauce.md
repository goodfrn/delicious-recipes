ingredients:
- "3 cloves garlic minced"
- "1 small fresh rosemary sprig"
- "1 small fresh thyme sprig"
- "20 ml olive oil"
- "200 ml tomato purée"
- "200 ml 35% cream"
- "40 g pecorino romano grated"
- "Pinch of chili flakes"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Add minced garlic plus rosemary and thyme. Cook gently until garlic is golden but not burnt, herbs fully aromatic — around 4 minutes. Watch constantly; burnt garlic ruins sauce."
- "Add chili flakes now to bloom their flavor slightly. Pour in tomato purée, stir well. Raise heat just enough to see bubbles forming at edges. Simmer uncovered 10-12 minutes, sauce deepens in color with subtle glossy rim. Stir often to avoid sticking."
- "Lower heat. Slowly add cream in a steady stream while stirring vigorously to emulsify sauce. Keep on low heat, let sauce thicken slight, about 5 minutes. Look for beads of sauce forming on spoon. Avoid boiling here — cream can break."
- "Remove herb sprigs by hand. Off heat, whisk in pecorino quickly until melted and sauce turns richer, silkier. Taste—adjust salt pepper last. Pecorino adds salty umami and sharpness."
- "If sauce too thick, loosen with splash warm water or reserved pasta water. If too thin, simmer a few more minutes gently. Serve right away with fresh gnocchi or penne."
introduction: "Start with basics — olive oil, not butter. Butter can burn fast, olive oil lets garlic and herbs infuse gently. Garlic gets sweet and aromatic this way. Throw in thyme alongside rosemary to add complexity. Tomato purée, it’s thicker than coulis so concentrate flavors faster. No hurry — low-and-slow coaxing develops depth. Chili flakes sneak in a shadow of heat, wakes up the sauce. Cream isn’t just for richness but balances acidity of tomato. Pecorino swaps in for parmesan, sharper punch, saltier finish. Watch temperature control, crucial to prevent separation or grainy texture. Removing herbs at the end avoids bitter notes, leaving clean herbal aroma. Sauce thickness? Look closely, visual cues on pan edges better than a clock. Thin if needed with pasta water. Gnocchi or fresh pasta love this, clings well, silky but with bite. Simple staples, little tweaks, that’s how layers of flavor breathe life."
ingredientsNote: "Garlic is king here — mince finely so it releases oils fast but won’t scorch. Use fresh rosemary sprig with leaves intact for frittering into sauce; thyme is less intrusive, adds subtle earthiness. Olive oil preferred for its higher smoke point and cleaner finish than butter; butter can overwhelm with dairy fat, burn if overheated. Tomato purée works better than coulis; more concentrated solids, less watery, makes sauce velvety quicker. Cream should be full fat — 35 percent minimum — gives body and prevents curdling. Pecorino romano is saltier and more assertive than parmesan; if unavailable, aged grana padano or even sharp aged cheddar could substitute but flavors shift. Chili flakes optional, bring only a hint of bite, adjust by taste. Salt late — cheese adds saltiness, so add salt carefully to avoid over-seasoning."
instructionsNote: "Start heating olive oil on medium-low, don’t rush garlic; burnt bits cause bitterness and spoil sauce. When garlic is translucent and caressing the pan with soft sizzling, add herbs to infuse aroma without burning. Flip heat to medium once tomato purée goes in; bubbles forming at rim indicate simmering. Stir to prevent sticking or burning at bottom — clay or stainless pans work, avoid too thin metal that heats unevenly. Adding chili flakes here helps them toast slightly, boosting flavor. Lower heat when adding cream gradually — prevents splitting. Stirring continuously ensures smooth emulsion. Off heat, whisk cheese in cold saves sauce from curdling. Skim off herbs — twigs or needles left in sauce can taste bitter or stringy. Adjust thickness by eye, spoon test — sauce must coat but not drown pasta. Seal in flavor by serving sauce freshly made; reheat risks breakage. Keep a ladle of pasta cooking water for final thinning, liquid starch helps bind sauce to pasta strands."
tips:
- "Garlic's crucial. Mince finely for fast flavor release. Lightly golden, makes sweet notes. Too dark? Toss it. Strain through pace - lots to watch."
- "Fresh herbs, rosemary and thyme, add depth. Toss in whole sprigs. Not all herbs blend well. Strain before serving. Bitter notes ruin dishes."
- "Tomato purée, thicker than coulis. Concentrates flavor quickly. Look for glossy sheen while simmering, stir often. Check how it clings to pasta."
- "Chili flakes, just a pinch. Adjust as needed. Slow bloom in warm oil before adding tomatoes. Don't rush the heat. Balance is key."
- "Cream can split if overheated. Bring it in slowly. Emulsify while stirring. Look for silky texture. If it curdles, salvage with quick whisk."
faq:
- "q: Can I swap pecorino? a: Yes, use parmesan if needed. Aged grana padano works too. Flavors shift though. Test taste before serving."
- "q: My sauce is too thick, what to do? a: Splash warm water, or saved pasta water. Adjust gradually. Look for coating but not drowning."
- "q: What if it turns grainy? a: Avoid boiling. Use low heat when adding cream. Whisk vigorously. Flow keeps emulsion intact."
- "q: Can leftovers be stored? a: Yes, refrigerate a few days. Reheat on low heat. Watch for separation. Add a splash of water to revive texture."
