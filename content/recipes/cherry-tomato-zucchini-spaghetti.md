ingredients:
- "2 large zucchinis diced small"
- "45 ml olive oil"
- "1 medium onion finely chopped"
- "1 garlic clove minced"
- "¼ tsp red chili flakes"
- "560 g cherry tomatoes halved"
- "340 g dried spaghetti"
- "60 g green olives pitted and halved"
- "10 g fresh basil torn"
- "35 g grated pecorino romano cheese"
instructions:
- "Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in large nonstick pan over high heat. Toss in diced zucchini. Season with salt and pepper. Listen for crackle, sauté until edges golden and zucchini still firm but cooked through, about 6-7 minutes. Take care not to overload pan or they’ll steam not brown. Remove and rest on plate."
- "Reduce heat to medium. Add remaining olive oil and toss in onion plus garlic and chili flakes. Stir often to soften but avoid browning; translucency is key so sauce doesn’t turn bitter. After about 4 minutes, dump in the halved cherry tomatoes. Flip and stir frequently. Watch as they burst, juices release and sauce thickens—this takes roughly 18 minutes. Lower heat if edges start to burn. The thickened sauce will cling to pasta better."
- "Meanwhile, bring large pot of salted water to boil. Cook pasta just shy of al dente by a minute or two - firm to bite but cooked through. Scoop out 125 ml pasta water before draining pasta."
- "Back to sauce. Stir zucchini and olives into tomato base. Warm through 2 minutes. Adjust salt and pepper. If sauce looks too thick add reserved pasta water a splash at a time to loosen - no watery slop though, should coat pasta evenly."
- "Combine drained pasta with sauce in pan. Toss whole thing thoroughly so every strand glistens, sauce spread evenly. Fold in fresh basil at very end for maximum aroma punch."
- "Serve immediately with pecorino romano sprinkled on top. Pecorino sharpness cuts through richness and boosts umami. Parmesan substitute has milder tang and creamier texture if you want softer flavor. Alternatively, shaved vegan parmesan or nutritional yeast if avoiding dairy."
introduction: "Cherry tomatoes collapse in the pan, skin splitting, juices thickening while diced zucchini crisps up separately to keep integrity. Start hot and fast with zucchini to get caramelized edges, not soggy blobs. Onion and garlic sneak in gentle flavor, never browned, just kissed by olive oil. Chili flakes traded bitterness for subtle heat. Spaghetti cooks al dente with reserved water held back to rescue sauce from drying. Mixing olives brings salt and a slightly different kiss; green olives punch up brightness over Kalamata’s deep tang. Basil added late, vibrant and fresh. Finishing with pecorino romano for bold salty notes that melt over the warm strands. Sensory checkpoints are crucial because timing varies with ingredient freshness and pan heat. Don’t rush the sauce reduction; listen for a steady simmer, smell sweet acid rising, see the sauce thicken to coat pasta and avoid watery mess. This is about feeling, smelling, hearing, and tasting each step so nothing is generic or overcooked."
ingredientsNote: "Swapping out Kalamata olives for green olives alters the flavor slightly - green ones bring brightness and less bitterness. Use pitted rather than jarred whole as they’re easier to chop and disperse in sauce. Pecorino romano rather than parmesan pushes salt and sharp tang. If dairy-free, nutritional yeast or vegan parmesan flakes are simple subs with umami punch. Also reduced garlic to 1 clove plus a dust of chili flakes brings warmth without overpowering the fresh tomato sweetness. Zucchini diced small to promote even cooking and quick browning but still with bite. Olive oil quality matters, use a fruity extra virgin oil. Onion should be finely chopped to incorporate into sauce evenly without harsh chunks. Spaghetti cooked just shy of al dente since it will finish in sauce; overcooked pasta just gets mushy. Reserve pasta water for sauce adjustments—its starch is the secret glue. Salt and pepper and layering seasoning at steps keeps balance. Almost missing seasoning here ruins everything."
instructionsNote: "Zucchini needs high dry heat - pan must be hot, don’t crowd or moisture will leak and steam instead of caramelizing. Test by tossing a few in and look for golden edges and listen for sizzle; take them out before they go limp or start to get soggy. Onion and garlic soften over medium heat only, no color for that fresh sweet base flavor. Tomatoes added once onions transparent. They should bubble and break apart until thicker sauce forms, about 15-20 minutes; too fast or too high heat will burn or dry sauce irregularly; stir often. Spaghetti timing critical - undercook by a minute or two so it finishes cooking in sauce without breaking apart. Use tongs to mix sauce and pasta vigorously so sauce clings. Add pasta water gradually to loosen sauce incrementally, not all at once. Last step basil and cheese. Add basil at end off heat to avoid bitterness and maximize aroma. Cheese is final flourish that amps flavor; sprinkle over plate not in pan if you want distinct texture on top. Salt at various stages—early on zucchini, again after sauce thickened, then final adjustment after combining all ingredients. Taste, tweak, trust nose and eyes for doneness not the clock."
tips:
- "Saute zucchini hot. Hear that sizzle, watch for golden edges. Don't crowd the pan. Moisture will ruin. Crisp not mush."
- "Adjust timing for pasta. Undercook by a couple minutes. Finish in sauce. Taste for texture—al dente feels right. Look for that glistening."
- "Reserve pasta water carefully. Starchy, not watery. Gradually add for desired consistency. Not a flood, just enough to coat."
- "Pecorino romano sharpness cuts through richness. Skip parmesan if you want less tang. Consider vegan alternatives if needed."
- "Add basil off heat. Fragrant explosion of aroma. Avoid bitterness, use fresh torn leaves, not chopped. Sprinkle over top to avoid wilting."
faq:
- "q: What about leftover pasta? a: Store in fridge, covered. Will dry if exposed. Reheat gently, splash of water helps. Not too hot."
- "q: Can I swap for another cheese? a: Yes, try feta for tang. Or goat cheese for creaminess. Just crumble in at end, blends well."
- "q: My tomatoes aren’t bursting? a: Try higher heat, watch closely. If still firm, add a splash of water. Cook slower if needed."
- "q: How to store fresh basil? a: Keep in water, like flowers. Wrap lightly in damp paper towel in fridge. Use fast; wilts quickly."
