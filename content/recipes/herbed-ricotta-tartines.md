ingredients:
- "=== Herbed ricotta ==="
- "120 g (1/2 cup) fresh ricotta cheese"
- "40 ml (2 tbsp) finely chopped herbs like parsley and tarragon"
- "1/4 lemon zest finely grated"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) lemon juice"
- "Salt and pepper to taste"
- "=== Tartines ==="
- "2 large slices country bread, toasted"
- "2 thick slices heirloom tomato"
- "Extra virgin olive oil for drizzling"
- "Flaky sea salt like Maldon for finishing"
instructions:
- "=== Herbed ricotta ==="
- "1. In a bowl, combine ricotta, chopped herbs, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Season liberally with salt and black pepper. Stir gently but thoroughly until blended. Set aside while bread toasts."
- "=== Tartines assembly ==="
- "2. Lay toasted bread slices on plates. Spread a generous layer of the herbed ricotta on each slice."
- "3. Top with thick tomato slices. Add a few twists of black pepper over the tomato."
- "4. Drizzle olive oil in a thin stream over tomatoes. Sprinkle flaky sea salt to taste."
- "5. Serve immediately. Best eaten fresh before bread gets soggy."
introduction: "Ricotta wakes from the fridge, soft and creamy. Fresh herbs chopped coarse, tossed in with citrus zest, zingy sharpness cutting the dairy cream. Bread thick-cut, country style, grilled lightly to crunch but not dry. Tomato slices, ripe, heavy with juice, placed messy on top. Olive oil drizzled, shiny and golden. Sea salt crystals crackle under the teeth. Quick to pull together, no fuss cooking, no waiting. Bright herbal notes with the warmth of lemon, rich ricotta tamed by the freshness of tomato. Two bites. Satisfying. Vegetarian ticked off, no eggs, no nuts. A simple plate, bold with flavors that punch through."
ingredientsNote: "Reduced ricotta amount by about 30% for a lighter spread, still creamy but less dense. Herbs swapped out basil and chives for parsley and tarragon, earthier with a touch of bitterness. Lemon juice cut down a tad; acidity balanced but not overpowering. Added zest from less than half the lemon to keep brightness subtle, no need for too much tartness. Bread must be country style, rustic, not too soft or you lose texture after the tomato is added. Tomatoes replaced with heirloom—meaty, less watery, more bite. Flaked sea salt kept for pops of crunchy salt bursts. Olive oil is essential, fruitiest you can find. Keep herbs fresh and never overdo lemon or salt. Toast bread till just crisp not blackened."
instructionsNote: "Start by whisking ricotta with herbs first, lemon juice last so it doesn't curdle the cheese. Season the mix well, a touch more pepper than usual. Toast bread slices till golden on both sides but still carrying moisture. Spread ricotta thickly while bread is warm for binding. Tomatoes should be thick-cut and slightly chilled; warm bread meets cooler tomato cools the mouth. After layering tomato, a quick crack of fresh pepper and direct olive oil drizzle. Don't soak bread or it turns soggy fast. Sprinkle salt just before serving so it stays crunchy. Ready to eat immediately. If sitting, spread ricotta separately and add tomato later. Takes 12 minutes prep, about 8 minutes to toast and assemble. Simple steps, focus on fresh ingredients and layering flavors."
tips:
- "Use fresh herbs for best flavor. Parsley, tarragon or even thyme work well. Don’t skimp on seasoning. Salt and pepper enhance the taste. Lemon juice, don’t overdo it. It may overpower. Balance acidity. Toast bread till golden. Crisp but not burnt. Keep some moisture."
- "Spread ricotta while bread is warm. Helps it stick better. Layer tomatoes thick for heft. Juiciness is crucial. Choose heirloom for richness. Drizzle olive oil generously. Extra virgin brings fruitiness. Let salt be flaky, the crunch is key. Always sprinkle before serving."
- "Assemble just before serving. Bread loses its crispness quickly. If prepped early, keep tomatoes separate. Consider refrigeration for tomatoes. Spread ricotta in advance. Keep it fresh but not cold. Texture matters. Avoid soggy tartines, respect the bread."
- "Experiment with variations. Different bread types can change flavor. Ciabatta or sourdough could work. Swap herbs if desired. Basil or chives bring different notes. Add greens under tomatoes for freshness. Try different cheeses too. Goat cheese could add depth."
- "Taste as you go. Flavor is essential, adjust as needed. Add more salt or herbs, but do it gradually. Enjoy each bite with contrasting textures. Creamy cheese, crunchy bread, juicy tomatoes. Keep everything balanced. Don’t forget the final drizzle of oil."
faq:
- "q: How to store leftovers a: Best to keep components separate. Bread will get soggy. Refrigerate ricotta in an airtight. Tomatoes in another. Use within a day if possible. Enjoy freshness."
- "q: Can I use different bread a: Yes, many options are fine. Sourdough could add tang. Whole grain for fiber. Toasting is essential, keep it layered. Crisp architecture is a must."
- "q: What if I don't have heirloom tomatoes a: Regular tomatoes work. Just choose ripe ones. Look for flavor, firmness. Juiciness matters, avoid watery kinds. Taste is critical here."
- "q: Can I make Herbed Ricotta in advance a: Sure, prepare a few hours prior. Keep it chilled. Just remember to mix before spreading. Fresh herbs will stay vibrant, but they may lose some flair over time."
