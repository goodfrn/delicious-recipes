ingredients:
- "630 g (1 1/3 lb) cod fillets, cut into 4 portions"
- "3 slices fresh ginger"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) olive oil"
- "12 ml (3/4 tbsp) unsalted butter"
- "150 ml (2/3 cup) chicken broth"
- "40 ml (2 2/3 tbsp) soy sauce"
- "12 ml (3/4 tbsp) lime juice"
- "10 ml (2 tsp) brown sugar"
- "3 ml (3/4 tsp) sambal oelek"
- "1 medium zucchini, sliced into ribbons with mandoline"
- "1 small avocado, diced and tossed with lime juice"
- "2 green onions, thinly sliced"
- "12 g (1/3 cup) fresh cilantro leaves"
instructions:
- "Heat large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add olive oil and place ginger slices in the pan. Sear cod fillets in oil and ginger without moving for 4 minutes."
- "Add butter, cook 1-2 more minutes until golden crust forms on bottom. Season with salt and pepper. Flip fish. Remove skillet from heat. Let fish rest 5 minutes until cooked through. Keep fish warm. Keep ginger and pan juices in skillet."
- "Add broth, soy sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, and sambal oelek to skillet. Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer until sauce reduces by half, about 5 minutes. Discard ginger slices."
- "Add zucchini ribbons to skillet. Stir and cook just until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed."
- "Divide zucchini among shallow bowls or plates. Place fish on top. Scatter diced avocado, green onions, and cilantro over dishes. Drizzle pan sauce over everything. Serve immediately. Rice optional."
introduction: "Cod cut thick. Ginger slices, big ol' handful, get browned first. Heat revved high, oil shimmering. Fish hits pan. No poking. Patience or crust lost. Butter slides in quick, foaming, browning bottom sides. Flip. Rest off heat. Juices mingling in skillet. Then broth, soy, lime, sugar, sambal—boil down to thick glaze. Ginger out, no bitterness. Zucchini ribbons spiral soft but still snap. Toss in sauce, quick whirl. Plates waiting. Stack fish, nest zucchini, scatter cool avocado, raw scallions, fresh cilantro tearing. Pour slick sauce over. Rice? Up to you."
ingredientsNote: "Cut cod into uniform thick filets to ensure even cooking. Fresh ginger slices provide a subtle but bright aromatic layer; discard after sauce reduction to avoid bitterness. Adjust sambal oelek quantity depending on spice tolerance—start small and add later if necessary. Using mandoline for zucchini ribbons gives texture contrast. Lime juice on avocado prevents browning and adds acidity. The measured butter and olive oil combo balances flavor and crispiness without excess fat. Sauce components reduce to concentrate sweetness and saltiness, tying the dish together. Fresh herbs finish, not cooked in."
instructionsNote: "Start by heating oil and browning ginger in the pan to release flavor. Place cod skinless side down, don’t move for several minutes to let crust develop. Adding butter later helps browning but avoid overcooking. Resting fish off heat ensures doneness is even without drying. Sauce reduction intensifies flavors — keep an eye, don’t let burn. Removing ginger after reduction prevents overpowering bitterness. Adding zucchini last maintains some crunch and bite, cooking briefly. Dressing avocado with lime stops browning, extra flavor. Assemble just before serving to keep fresh textural contrasts intact. Optional rice on side for a heartier plate."
tips:
- "Use thick cod filets. Helps ensure even cooking throughout. Cut cod uniform. Without skin. Don’t poke it. Wait for crust to form. Patience required."
- "Fresh ginger slices pack flavor. Sear first, release oils. Butter added later helps browning. Perfect balance on cod. Watch carefully."
- "Adjust sambal oelek depending on spice level. Start with less. You can always add more later. Spicy isn’t for everyone. Be cautious."
- "For zucchini, use mandoline for ribbons. Texture is key. Slightly crisp. Cook briefly to keep that bite. Too long turns mushy."
- "Diced avocado tossed with lime juice prevents browning. Add acidity, freshness. Use fresh cilantro, green onions for garnish. Brightness like no other."
