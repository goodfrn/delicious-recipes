ingredients:
- "=== Quinoa ==="
- "370 ml (1 ½ cups) water"
- "175 ml (¾ cup) quinoa"
- "=== Salad ==="
- "525 ml (2 ¼ cups) cooked peeled beets cut into cubes (about 4 medium beets)"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) red wine vinegar"
- "625 ml (2 ½ cups) watermelon cubes"
- "375 ml (1 ½ cups) roughly chopped arugula"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) olive oil"
- "170 g (6 oz) fresh feta cheese, crumbled (optional)"
- "Salt and pepper"
instructions:
- "=== Quinoa ==="
- "1. Bring water and quinoa to a boil in medium saucepan. Cover and simmer on low heat about 17 minutes, until water absorbed."
- "2. Remove from heat. Let stand covered 7 minutes. Fluff gently with a fork. Cool completely, spread on tray if needed."
- "=== Salad ==="
- "3. Combine diced beets and vinegar in large bowl. Let sit while quinoa cools — helps flavor soak."
- "4. Add quinoa, olive oil, watermelon, and arugula. Toss to distribute evenly. Season with salt and pepper to taste."
- "5. Serve chilled or room temperature. Crumble feta over top before serving if desired."
introduction: "Chopping watermelon next to sweet earthy beet cubes. The hot quinoa steams under the lid. Dressings sharp then mellow with olive oil and red wine vinegar. Arugula bites peppery, fresh. Cheese? Choose feta this time, crumbled and salty. No eggs, no nuts, gluten none. Six plates come together. The cooking flow is quirky. Cool quinoa before assembly, but beets can marinate just a bit in vinegar. Flavor changing with time. Simple textures collide — soft, crisp, crumbly. Bright mix balances. Chill. Eat. Feed."
ingredientsNote: "Quinoa—the backbone here—cut from one cup to three-quarters. Water adjusts a bit to keep cooking texture steady. Fewer beets, smaller quantity to thin the earthiness. Watermelon down one half cup, arugula lowers to balance the sweetness. Olive oil reduced slightly to two tablespoons, smoother dressing finish. Feta replaces cheese of goat with a salty crumble twist. Vinegar trims two tablespoons to avoid overpowering. Salt and pepper held to taste. These sizes temper the original, easier to balance in a smaller bowl without lost flavors. The beet and watermelon quantities are kept below original to keep freshness high and not make the salad too wet. Timing for quinoa extended by a few minutes to ensure fluff. Rest time also extended, helps moisture settle and cool effectively for easier toss. Feta swaps for goat soften the salty tang; an optional twist but changes the mood of the dish nicely."
instructionsNote: "Bring quinoa and water to a rolling boil before covering takes center. Simmer slightly longer than before, nearing 17 minutes rather than 15. Then a longer rest under lid, 7 minutes, lets steam finish cooking grains. Fluff carefully not to crush. Spread out if stickiness occurs, speeding coolness. Instead of blending ingredients all at once, first vinegar meets beets for flavor mingling. While quinoa cools. When assembling, olive oil introduces softly, followed by watermelon cubes, and finally arugula tossed lightly. Salt and pepper come late, to keep freshness alive. If cheese desired, crumble over just before serving, so it holds shape and flavor punch. Serve chilled or room temp—not warmed. This staggered approach balances moisture, flavor depth, and texture contrasts. Total time about 45 minutes. The mix of warm quinoa resting, beet-vinegar sit time, and final toss timing creates layers of flavors that pop distinctly but blend well. Skip any stirring until quinoa cooled to keep texture intact."
tips:
- "Use pre-cooked beets. Cuts time. Canned or vacuum-packed are fine. They add color. Sweetness too. Just drain and dice. Adds soft texture with crunch. Balance."
- "Rinse quinoa well before cooking. Removes bitterness. Subtle flavor boost. Use a ratio of 1 cup quinoa to 1.5 cups water. Simmer gently. Rest covered after. Fluff with a fork."
- "Add other greens if desired. Baby spinach or mixed greens work well. Experiment with herbs. Fresh basil or mint enhances sweetness. Adjust seasonings as needed. Don't be shy."
- "Make it vegan by omitting the cheese. The salad still pops with flavors. Try avocado for creaminess. Cut down on oil if needed. Watermelon adds sweetness. Great replacement."
- "Store the salad in an airtight container. Keeps in the fridge for two days. Flavors meld nicely. But add arugula closer to serving time. It wilts otherwise. Maintain freshness."
faq:
- "q: How long does the salad last? a: Best eaten fresh. Can store for two days. Flavors change over time. Crispness of arugula fades. Keep covered in fridge."
- "q: Can I substitute anything? a: Yes. Feta can swap for vegan cheese. Goat cheese another option. Choose your favorite dressing too. Olive oil by avocado oil."
- "q: What to serve it with? a: Pairs well with grilled meats. Light fish or chicken. Serve alongside a whole grain. Versatile and filling salad. Good for lunch or dinner."
- "q: How to prepare beets quickly? a: Roasting is great. Wrap in foil and bake. Simmer in water until tender. Can also microwave wrapped in a damp paper towel. Quick method."
