ingredients:
- "550 ml (2 ¼ cups) chicken broth"
- "1 ham bone (optional)"
- "450 ml (1 ¾ cups) peeled diced potatoes"
- "450 ml (1 ¾ cups) sliced leek (about 1 leek)"
- "75 ml (1/3 cup) unsalted butter"
- "75 ml (1/3 cup) all-purpose flour"
- "450 ml (1 ¾ cups) diced spiced glazed apple ham"
- "450 ml (1 ¾ cups) small broccoli florets"
- "175 ml (¾ cup) whole milk"
- "3 ml (½ tsp) dry mustard powder"
- "1 sheet (185 g) frozen puff pastry thawed"
- "1 egg yolk"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) water"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Heat 450 ml chicken broth with the ham bone and potatoes in a pot. Simmer about 12 minutes until potatoes are just tender. Remove bone and set broth-potato mixture aside."
- "Preheat oven to 205°C (400°F). Position rack in middle."
- "Melt butter in pan. Add leek and cook until softened, seasoning with salt and pepper. Sprinkle in flour and stir well."
- "Pour in remaining 100 ml chicken broth plus milk. Stir in mustard, ham cubes, broccoli. Bring to a gentle boil."
- "Remove from heat. Fold in reserved broth and potatoes. Mix thoroughly. Transfer filling into 28 x 20 cm (11 x 8 inch) baking dish."
- "Roll puff pastry to 24 cm (9 ½ inch) square. Cut into 16 small squares."
- "Lay squares overlapping over filling, stretching slightly to cover completely."
- "Whisk egg yolk and water. Brush over pastry squares."
- "Bake 28–33 minutes. Puff pastry should be golden and set."
introduction: "Ham and potatoes, cooked quick with a touch of spice and crisp on top. Broccoli adds green crunch, leeks bring the subtle sweetness. Potatoes simmered with a ham bone make broth that’s layered, deep in flavor. Puff pastry cut fine—small overlapping squares, crispy and buttery, not just one thick crust. Mustard powder kicks in, keeps the sauce sharp and not just heavy cream. Milk adds creaminess but stays loose enough to spoon. The whole dish is a mix of textures and tastes, with a slight apple hint in the ham. Cooking times shifted a bit; simmer the spuds just longer for bite, bake the pie till just golden. Forget big prep, this can come together in under 2 hours."
ingredientsNote: "All-purpose flour thickens but keep it light to avoid clumps. Use whole milk for richness but skim works if you want less fat. The ham bone is optional but recommended for depth—roast or store-bought works. Broccoli florets should be small, so they cook alongside sauce without becoming mush. Puff pastry cut into small overlapping squares creates patches of crisp crust rather than one thick piece that can get soggy underneath. Replace traditional glazed apple ham with spiced glazed ham, adding subtle sweet heat. Substitute leeks with scallions for a sharper bite to the filling. Season well with salt and pepper at each stage to build layers."
instructionsNote: "Start by making a broth with potatoes and ham bone—the flavor seeps in slowly. Keep an eye so potatoes don't overcook; want al dente texture. While broth simmers, cook leeks in butter until soft and translucent—no browning. Stir in flour to coat leeks well, then gradually add liquids, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Bring sauce to bubble before adding ham and broccoli to partially cook. Finally, fold in potatoes and broth from earlier, mix gently to keep chunks intact. Roll puff pastry and slice squares carefully so the edges overlap like shingles on a roof, this traps steam and creates a patchwork of crisp bits. Brush with egg wash evenly for nice color and shine. Bake until visibly golden with a firm crust. Let sit few minutes before serving to settle filling."
tips:
- "Choose a flavorful ham for best results. Spiced glazed apple ham preferred. If unavailable, consider other cured hams. Cold cuts won't work as well. Look for a hearty texture. Fresh is best for flavor."
- "Cut potatoes into even pieces, helps cook uniformly. Aim for small cubes. This ensures they get tender but not mushy. Adjust cooking time accordingly with their size. Check for doneness."
- "Puff pastry needs to be rolled evenly. Cutting into squares should not compromise shape. Use a sharp knife for clean edges. Cover with overlapping pieces. Traps steam, crisps the surfaces."
- "Season layers well while cooking. Start from leeks to the final dish. Kim our flavor base. It'll bring depth. Balance seasoning at each step, building flavor as you go."
- "Always let the pot pie rest before serving. Filling will set slightly after removing from the oven. Cutting too soon leads to spilling. Five to ten minutes works. Enhance experience."
faq:
- "q: What kind of ham can I use? a: Look for spiced glazed or similar types. Cured ham works well. Avoid deli meats. Flavor is key. Fresh ham adds depth."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep in an airtight container. Fridge up to four days. Can also freeze. Just thaw before reheating. Best to eat fresh."
- "q: Can I make this ahead? a: Yes, assemble but don’t bake. Cover well. Chill overnight. Bake next day, add time. Adjusting for cold filling."
- "q: What if I don't have leeks? a: Use scallions or chopped onions. Differences in flavor, but works fine. Adjust quantity to taste. Both offer crunch."
