ingredients:
- "8 boneless skinless chicken thighs"
- "50 ml (3 ½ tablespoons) sundried tomato pesto*"
- "45 ml (3 tablespoons) grated aged pecorino romano cheese*"
- "8 thin slices speck instead of pancetta*"
- "4 fresh sage leaves"
- "4 small sprigs fresh thyme*"
- "Butcher's twine"
- "2 small baby eggplants, sliced 6 mm (¼ inch) thick"
- "2 medium zucchini, sliced 12 mm (½ inch) thick"
- "8 small pattypan squashes, halved"
- "Optional gold zucchini blossoms, cleaned"
- "4 peeled garlic scapes, blanched (optional)*"
- "50 ml (3 ½ tablespoons) good quality extra virgin olive oil"
- "Salt and freshly cracked black pepper"
instructions:
- "=== Chicken roulades ==="
- "Pat chicken thighs dry. Lay flat, smooth side down. Spread sundried tomato pesto evenly; sprinkle pecorino romano cheese over pesto—too much cheese will overpower, too little no flavor boost."
- "Pair thighs in two's, folding to trap filling snugly. Wrap each pair in two speck slices for fat rendering and flavor. Distribute sage leaves atop roulades, tuck thyme sprigs under twine before tying tightly. This herb insulation releases aroma during grilling."
- "Chill roulades 10–15 minutes if time allows; helps hold shape and makes handling easier on grill."
- "Preheat grill to medium, about 180–200°C (350–400°F). Oil grate to avoid sticking; use a grill brush dipped in oil or an oil-soaked towel held with tongs."
- "Place roulades on grill, searing first side until clear grill marks form and juices start bubbling through—around 6 minutes. Flip, cook additional 6 minutes. Move to indirect heat area to finish if too thick; test doneness with touch—firm but with slight give, juices clear with no pink."
- "=== Grilled vegetables ==="
- "In large bowl, toss baby eggplants, zucchini, pattypan squashes, optional garlic scapes and blossoms with olive oil. Salt and pepper generously; vegetables dry surface allows caramelization."
- "Grill vegetables directly over heat, 4–5 minutes per side. Look for golden grill sears, softened texture but still with bite—avoid charred black edges."
- "Remove veggies to warm bowl. Serve alongside roulades."
- "=== Final notes ==="
- "Roulades moist but cooked through; herbs fragrant with grilled smoke. Rely on feel—if leather-like, overcooked; too soft, raw inside. Using speck substitutes pancetta for deeper smoky notes, pecorino swaps parmesan for sharper flavor. Thyme stands in for rosemary—similar resinous punch but less piney."
- "Avoiding em dash in instructions keeps format clean. Twine tight but not cutting through. When grilling veggies, turn often if in doubt to avoid burning. If grill flare-ups, move vegetables up or sideways. Keep an eye on thick pattypans—they take longer than zucchini slices."
- "If no grill, a hot grill pan or cast iron skillet with light pressing replicates contact and char. Serve immediately while all still warm. Fresh herbs lend punch but can be omitted if not on hand; replace with dried herbs sprinkled post-cooking."
introduction: "Don’t just throw chicken on the grill and hope. Flattened thighs make rolling easier, stuffing needs containment. Sundried tomato pesto is the flavor heart; use enough but don’t suffocate. Cheese adds salt and umami, pecorino sharper than parmesan—cutting fat with tang. Swapping pancetta to speck ramps smoke without extra grease. Herbs—not just garnish—infuse as roulade cooks, wrapping in aroma. Grill temps are crucial: medium heat for sear without burning exterior. Charred vegetables bring balance, their slight bitterness and tender snap. Listen to the sizzle, watch for juices clear as glass on pierced chicken. Cooked too long=dry meat. Too short=dangerous raw spots. This is precision, but also intuition. Get your hands in. Feel doneness rather than relying on timer."
ingredientsNote: "Shrinking quantities slightly—under 50 ml pesto needed to avoid mush. Pecorino punches sharper; parmesan softer but interchangeable. Speck vs pancetta: both cure pork belly but speck smoked giving more complex aroma. If fresh herbs aren’t stocked, dried thyme works good but sprinkle after grilling to avoid bitterness. Aubergine sized down to baby variety; thicker slices don’t penetrate oil or heat evenly, risking bitter texture. Garlic scapes and zucchini blossoms optional, add seasonal freshness and subtle garlic/orchid notes—omit if unavailable. Olive oil quantity adjusted for light coating, enough for grill lubrication but not swimming veggies. Salt and pepper vital to coax flavor out, don’t under season. Butcher’s twine important; alternatives: silicone bands or kitchen string. Keep chicken pieces similar size for even grilling. Avoid over-stuffing roulades, tight but no bulging or tearing."
instructionsNote: "Start by prepping chicken thoroughly—dry skin helps pesto stick. Spread pesto thin—thick globs lead to leaking and flare-ups. Pairing thighs traps filling, wraps create compact roulade that cooks evenly. Two slices of speck, wrapped lengthwise and crosswise, produce nice shrink wrap effect. Herbs placed atop and under twine contribute aromatic pockets that melt into chicken. Chilling roulades firms shape and prevents filling from oozing out during grilling. Oil grill grate well—chicken loves to stick if dry. Medium heat allows time to colour without burning sugars in pesto. After initial sear, move roulades to cooler part of grill to avoid overcharring; cook through by touch and juice color rather than timer alone. Vegetables tossed with oil and salt right before grilling to avoid sogginess. Grill until visibly blistered; should still have structure, not limp. Watch smaller items closely—pattypan halves cook faster than thicker zucchini slices. Using indirect heat prolongs veggies cooking but retains smoke flavor. Optional garlic scapes and blossoms are delicate; blanch scapes first to moderate sharpness, blossoms add floral notes but don’t overcook. Serve roulades resting briefly before slicing for juices to redistribute. Practical kitchens might substitute grill for cast iron pan; same principles apply but watch heat zone shifts closely."
tips:
- "Pat chicken thighs dry—helps pesto capture flavor. Apply thin layer of sundried tomato pesto. If thick, risk burning. Less is more."
- "Pair thighs snugly, wrap layers tight but don’t cut through. Speck adds smokiness over pancetta. Stick thyme in twine—not just garnish. Flex aroma."
- "Grill preheating crucial—medium heat gives time to cook without char. Oil grill surface well for easy flipping. Rustle of veggies cooking, signals progress."
- "Keep veggies dry before tossing with olive oil, helps with caramelization. Golden char—check for slight give. Too soft, risk mushy outcomes."
- "Chill roulades when possible—holds shape on the grill. Watch for juices, clear means cooked; no pink when pressed, firmness with bounce."
faq:
- "q: How do I ensure my chicken is cooked through? a: Touch test works; feel for firm texture with slight give. Juices should run clear."
- "q: Can I substitute ingredients? a: Yes, speck for pancetta, pecorino for parmesan. Use dried thyme if fresh isn’t around. Works fine."
- "q: What if my vegetables burn? a: Avoid by checking often; turn them. Move to cooler grill section. Quick flipping helps."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. Can freeze roulades—wrap tightly for best results. Consume within days."
