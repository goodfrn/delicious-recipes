slug: "grilled-asparagus-tofu-salad"
description: "A vibrant salad with smoky grilled asparagus, crunchy radishes, and creamy tofu silken chunks tossed in a herby olive and pumpkin seed vinaigrette. Quick grilling over hot coals locks in color and crunch. Ingredients and quantities shifted slightly for balance. Substituted chives with fresh basil, replaced honey with maple syrup bringing a rounded earthiness with a bit of sweet bite. Tossed radishes sliced post-grill to keep crisp texture popping alongside the soft tofu. Cooking times adjusted; grills judged by tactile springiness and color char rather than minutes. Flower salt used for finishing for punch plus aromatic lift."

ingredients:
- "=== Dressing ==="
- "50 ml olive oil"
- "45 ml freshly chopped basil leaves"
- "35 g black dried olives pitted and chopped"
- "35 g toasted pumpkin seeds coarsely crushed"
- "25 ml whole grain mustard"
- "15 ml maple syrup"
- "Zest finely grated and juice of one lemon"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
- "=== Salad ==="
- "400 g trimmed asparagus spears"
- "10 small radishes"
- "1 red onion quartered"
- "35 ml olive oil"
- "240 g kale torn"
- "450 g silken tofu room temperature torn into chunks"
- "Fleur de sel"
instructions:
- "=== Prepare vinaigrette ==="
- "In a medium bowl, whisk olive oil with mustard and maple syrup until emulsified. Stir in basil leaves, chopped olives, pumpkin seeds. Add lemon zest and juice. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside allowing flavors to marry."
- "=== Prepare grill and veggies ==="
- "Set up charcoal grill or gas grill. Preheat to medium-high. Rub oil over grill grates to prevent sticking. Place wok on one side to act as a stir-fry pan."
- "Toss asparagus, red onion quarters, and whole radishes with olive oil, salt, and pepper on a large plate."
- "Place radishes and onion in wok. Stir frequently. Listen for sizzle and notice skin blistering. After about 7 to 10 minutes the onion edges should caramelize, radishes soften but stay still firm. Simultaneously, grill asparagus directly on the grate moving them every 2 minutes for an even char, about 6 minutes total. They want to be bright green and toothsome—half firm. Avoid overcooking or they turn mushy and dull."
- "=== Assemble salad ==="
- "Cut grilled radishes in half lengthwise to display the rosy interior contrast. Distribute kale on plates. Mound grilled veg on top, nestle torn tofu chunks around."
- "Sprinkle tofu lightly with fleur de sel and crack fresh black pepper over everything. Drizzle the vinaigrette generously."
- "Serve immediately. The warm vegetables with cool tofu create textural contrast. If you must, hold dressing until last minute to keep kale from wilting."
introduction: "Grilling asparagus does more than cook it. That snap when you pull it from the grates signals exactly where it should be—bright emerald with char lines, tender yet crisp. Radishes soften while keeping a crunch if you manage heat right. A wok on the grill for onions picks up smoky notes and caramelizes sugars faster. Silken tofu torn gently holds vinaigrette without breaking down like firm tofu would, adding creamy cool relief against the smoky veg. This salad breathes summer; fresh herbs, pumpkin seeds toasted for nuttiness, and a touch of sweet maple balancing sharp mustard and lemon zing. Swap basil for chives, maple for honey if you prefer, or even lemon for lime depending on your garden or mood. Winter greens can sub for kale though kale adds texture contrast their cousins lack. Techniques here lean on sensory cues—skin blistering, color deepening, smell of caramelizing onion—more than timers. Trust the look and feel and your grill. Serve warm, bright, and fresh."
ingredientsNote: "Adjust pumpkin seeds to any nut or seed on hand—sunflower seeds or chopped walnuts add complexity. Black olives can be swapped for kalamata for extra fruitiness or omit if you want a milder dressing. Maple syrup instead of honey keeps this vegan but you can always use agave nectar or a pinch of sugar in a pinch weighing sweetness against acidity. Olive oil quality matters here; choose good extra virgin for dressing, but if grilling use a neutral oil with a higher smoke point to avoid bitterness—canola or grapeseed work fine. Tofu silken texture offers delicate mouthfeel but always drain and pat dry lightly or the salad becomes watery. Kale is sturdy enough to hold its shape and stand dressing but any hearty green like chard or baby spinach works. Radishes get a balance from grilling but if your grill is weak or you’re indoors, pan roasting with good oil and a hot pan does the trick."
instructionsNote: "Keep grill zones clear; wok and grate separate allows multiple cooking textures at once. The wok develops Maillard reactions on onions and radishes—watch for golden undertones, don’t rush with heat or you get burnt without caramel. Moving radishes and onions frequently prevents sticking and evens color. For asparagus, visual check is key. They’ll steam a little on grill; wait for cracks of color or char lines but still a firm snap when bent. Overdone asparagus loses structure fast. Tofu should be added at final plating; too long in heat leads to crumbling or wilting. Tear by hand for uneven, rustic chunks that catch dressing better than cubes. Finish with fleur de sel to punch all layers up, a seasoning step often missed but critical. If you don’t have fleur de sel, coarse sea salt works but less dramatically. The dressing can be made hours ahead and tastes better after rest, but toss just before serving for optimal texture especially on greens. Use your nose, ears, and eyes—when you smell sweet onion roasting and see the cast iron wok steaming and sizzling, you’re close."
tips:
- "Burnt edges on onions mean better flavor. Use medium-high heat for caramelizing. Move them often. Listen for the sizzle; it signals readiness. Toss radishes directly on grill for char, don’t shy away from grilling them; texture change is key."
- "Grill zones clear. Wok for onions on one side, grill for asparagus on another. Multi-task. Check for color, listen for sounds. Feel the snap when bending asparagus; it tells if cooked right. Visual is crucial."
- "Silken tofu is more forgiving. Tear rather than cube, crumbling enhances the texture with vinaigrette. Pat dry before using. Drain excess moisture. Avoid mushy salad. Meanwhile, check the warmth; serve immediately for best contrast."
- "Adjust oil type—neutral for grilling, like grapeseed. Olive oil for dressings is essential. High quality matters; poor oil ruins the balance. Pumpkin seeds swap for nuts if needed. Sunflower seeds work in a pinch—play around."
- "Fleur de sel at the end transforms. Pack a punch; use a light hand. If unavailable, coarse sea salt is fine. Watch oversalting. Dressing can sit for hours but toss salad just before serving. Keep that kale crisp."
faq:
- "q: How to tell if asparagus is grilled right? a: Color is key; bright green, char lines. Snap when bent, firm texture. Overdone? Turns mushy. Watch those cues."
- "q: What if I don’t have a grill? a: Use an oven broiler. Similar effect, high heat. Pan-roasting also works. Hot pan, good oil, toss often. Just follow heat cues."
- "q: Can I prep veggies ahead? a: Yes, but not too long. Cut radishes before grilling; unwrap avocado if used. Grill veggies just before serving. Keep it fresh."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate immediately. Use airtight container. Keep salad undressed. Wilting occurs quickly. For longer storage, separate components."
