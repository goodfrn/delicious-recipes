ingredients:
- "1 small lemon"
- "300 g pappardelle"
- "3 medium shallots, finely chopped"
- "25 ml unsalted butter"
- "50 ml fresh lemon juice"
- "150 ml half-and-half"
- "1 1/4 ml crushed red pepper flakes"
- "40 ml chopped fresh dill"
- "225 g northern shrimp, thawed if frozen, patted dry"
- "Fresh lemon wedges for plating (optional)"
- "1 tbsp olive oil"
instructions:
- "Zest lemon with fine grater; remove white pith carefully to avoid bitterness. Julienne zest thinly or finely mince. Set aside separately from juice extracted next step."
- "Bring large pot of salted water to boil. Add pappardelle. Stir gently to prevent sticking. Watch closely; remove pasta a little before fully tender — slightly chewy but not raw. Reserve 100 ml pasta water before draining."
- "While pasta cooks, heat butter and olive oil over medium heat in large skillet. Add shallots, soften gently, translucence is key not browning — about 4-5 minutes. Patience here builds sweetness."
- "Pour in half lemon juice (25 ml), let reduce almost dry—listen for sizzle slowing down and watch surface become matte. This intensifies sharpness without raw acid bite."
- "Add zest, remaining lemon juice, half-and-half, and crushed red pepper. Stir, bring to gentle simmer—the cream will thicken slightly, coat spoon in around 2 minutes. Keep edges bubbling but not boiling to avoid curdling."
- "Drop in drained pasta and reserved water gradually — incorporate slowly, stirring to get sauce to cling. Pasta should finish cooking in sauce; test mouthfeel not timer."
- "Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Once sauce lightly thickens and clings, remove from heat."
- "Fold in dill for fresh green note, stirring once or twice only to avoid bruising."
- "Add shrimp on top of pasta just before serving — residual heat warms them through without toughness. If shrimp already cooked, skip heating to avoid rubberiness. If raw, sauté separately with a touch of oil until opaque, about 2 minutes per side, then plate atop."
- "Serve immediately with lemon wedges to adjust brightness at the table."
introduction: "Zest and acid are your weapons here. Lemon twist hits before cream rounds out edges. Shrimp need patience — dry and cool, never soggy or rubbery. Pappardelle brings a chewy heft but still delicate structure. Shallots, not onions, for that subtle pungency melting slowly in butter adds depth. Watch sauce, not timer, for thickness. When it clings just right, stop. Use reserved pasta water — magic ingredient — to loosen and bind sauce without diluting flavor. Dill replaces tarragon for fresh herbaceous punch, equally bright but distinct. Chile flakes tiptoe through background, a warmth you feel not bite. No fancy tricks, just attention. Timing staggered so sauce is ready as pasta finishes — streamlined. Bright, creamy, mildly spicy — none overpower each other."
ingredientsNote: "Lemon zest needs to be free of white pith; otherwise, bitterness kills bright notes. If no fresh shrimp available, quality frozen will do—defrost fully in refrigerator overnight, pat dry to avoid excess water diluting sauce. Half-and-half handles the heat and acid better than 35% cream in this dish—less heavy, still creamy. Butter balances olive oil’s grassy aroma but avoid too much; keeps sauce from getting greasy. Fresh dill is key; dried herb lacks brightness and texture. Shallots bring a gentler, sweeter profile than regular onions. If none, mild sweet onions can substitute but reduce quantity by half and sweat gently. Red pepper flakes add subtle heat—adjust depending on spice tolerance or omit if serving kids. Reserving pasta water crucial: it contains starch that binds sauce to noodles, prevents sauce from pooling in plate, stops it looking thin. Open to experimentation: thyme or chervil works if dill not available but change flavor profile significantly."
instructionsNote: "Pay attention to shallots’ texture — translucent, very tender but no browning unless you want sweetness and nuttiness. Reduction of lemon juice before adding cream is key to concentrate acid flavor—make sure liquid simmers gently, not boils aggressively or you risk sharp aroma overwhelming. Add cream slowly and stir gently to avoid curdling; cream at room temperature preferable to cold from fridge—helps it incorporate smoothly. Pasta timing overcooked? Rescue by refreshing in cold salted water briefly then draining and reheating in sauce. Pasta water’s cloudy starch not just any water—never use cold tap water to loosen sauce, it cools down everything and reduces emulsification. Adding fresh dill last preserves its grassy aroma and prevents bitterness or softening. For shrimp, if raw, cook separately with little oil until opaque and firm but still tender; add on top of pasta — residual heat finishes warming without risking toughness. Use gentle tossing motions not vigorous stirring to avoid breaking pasta ribbons or bruising herbs."
tips:
- "Zest lemon first, white pith kills the brightness. Julienne finely or mince. Use fresh shrimp if possible; frozen works too, defrost fully."
- "Pasta timing end of cooking in the sauce matters. A little chewy, but not raw. Save that starchy pasta water, it thickens sauce without dilution."
- "Shallots are key. Soft but not browned. They add sweetness without overpowering. If substituting onion, cut quantity in half. Sweat them gently."
- "Crushed red pepper adds warmth, adjust to spice levels. Omit if serving kids. Mix in dill last to preserve freshness. Avoid bruising herbs."
- "For shrimp, if raw, cook separately. Two minutes side until opaque. Then add on top, avoid overcooking. Residual heat works wonders."
faq:
- "q: How to keep pasta from sticking together? a: Stir gently as it cooks, don't let it clump. Add olive oil, that helps too."
- "q: What if my sauce is too thick? a: Add reserved pasta water gradually. It’s your best friend. Thin it out without losing flavor."
- "q: Can I use heavy cream instead? a: Sure, but half-and-half handles acidity better. Less greasy, lighter taste. Just remember watch for curdling."
- "q: Storage options for leftovers? a: Keep in airtight container in fridge. Use in a few days. Reheat gently. Don’t overdo. Shrimp can toughen."
