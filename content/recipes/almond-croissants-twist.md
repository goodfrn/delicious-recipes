ingredients:
- "80 g (1/3 cup) unsalted butter, softened"
- "40 g (3 tbsp) sugar"
- "1 egg yolk, room temperature"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) almond extract"
- "100 g (3/4 cup) almond meal"
- "20 ml (1 tbsp) cornstarch"
- "4 croissants, sliced horizontally"
- "25 g (1/4 cup) chopped walnuts"
- "Powdered sugar, for dusting"
instructions:
- "Set oven rack mid-level. Preheat oven to 175 °C (350 °F). Line baking sheet with parchment or silicone mat."
- "Beat butter and sugar until creamy. Add egg yolk and almond extract. Mix thoroughly."
- "Fold in almond meal and cornstarch gently. Reserve 50 ml (3 tbsp) of almond cream."
- "Spread remaining almond cream inside croissants bases. Close croissants."
- "Brush reserved almond cream atop croissants. Sprinkle chopped walnuts evenly."
- "Place croissants on baking sheet. Optionally freeze now for later baking."
- "Bake 30 to 35 minutes until golden and set. Cool slightly."
- "Dust with powdered sugar just before serving."
introduction: "Butter, sugar, egg yolk. Almond meal, nutty. Croissants halved and filled, then topped. Walnuts instead of usual sliced almonds for added crunch. Cornstarch smooths cream texture, less dense. Freeze before baking if time tight. Oven heats mid rack, gentle but thorough. Baking longer than usual—crispy edges, soft inside. Dust with powdered sugar for final touch. Simple, layered. Rustic almond sweets. Crunch meets soft, bite after bite. Quick fill and bake, no fuss. Keep it light, not too sweet, mild almond punch. A twist on a classic, familiar yet different."
ingredientsNote: "Butter softened, not melted, breaks down sugar easily. Less sugar for less overpowering sweet. Cornstarch instead of flour gives silkier filling, less grainy. Walnuts—chopped small—toasting a bit inside oven brings out oils, deep flavor that sliced almonds miss. Egg yolk enriches and binds. Use fresh croissants, day-old is fine but too stale won’t absorb cream well. If freezing, lay croissants flat to keep shape. Almond extract strong—one teaspoon just right. Adjust to taste. Powdered sugar dusting optional, for light sweetness and presentation. Keep croissants refrigerated if not baking immediately."
instructionsNote: "Start oven early, temperature steady. Cream butter and sugar thoroughly—light texture helps filling. Folding in almond meal and cornstarch last, low speed or spatula, prevents overmixing, keeps cream tender. Reserve portion of almond cream to brush on croissants for golden finish. Fill croissant halves evenly but don’t overstuff or they spill during baking. Freezing halfway is smart for prepping ahead, bake directly from freezer with extra 5 min. Watch edges: golden but not burnt. Cool on rack to prevent sogginess underneath. Dust with powdered sugar once cool to avoid melting into croissants. Serve warm or room temp."
tips:
- "When creaming butter and sugar, make sure butter isn’t melted. Softened is key. It breaks down sugar easily. Texture lightens up the filling."
- "Freezing croissants before baking is smart for prep. Lay flat. That keeps shape. Bake straight from freezer, add about 5 extra minutes to time."
- "Cornstarch substitutes flour here. Smoother filling, gives silkiness instead of grainy refusal. Great twist. Perfect for all recipes needing cream."
- "Walnuts chopped small. Toasting them inside oven brings out flavors. Deep nutty notes add dimension, replaces usual almond topping. Gives crunch."
- "Egg yolk enriches the cream. It binds all elements nicely. Mix in gently to keep tender. Don’t overmix—it toughens the filling."
faq:
- "q: Can I use different nuts for the topping? a: Yes other nuts can work, like pistachios or pecans. Change nut, texture and flavor feel different."
- "q: How long can I freeze the croissants? a: Up to one month in the freezer. It’s flexible. Keep them sealed to avoid freezer burn though."
- "q: What if I want my croissants sweeter? a: Add a bit more sugar inside. Adjust to taste. Or dust extra powdered sugar on top before serving."
- "q: Can you reheat them later? a: Yes, wrap in foil. Warm in oven, or microwave. Just don’t burn or dry out. Aim for soft and warm."
