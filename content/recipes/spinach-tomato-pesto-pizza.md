description: "A vibrant pizza layering sautéed greens, fresh tomatoes, and tangy cheeses, finished with fragrant pesto and crunchy pine nuts. Sautéed spinach avoids soggy spots. A mix of mozzarella and tangy goat cheese replaces feta for a creamier bite. Sun-dried tomatoes swapped with roasted red peppers adds smoky depth. Dough prebaked lightly prevents watery crust. Pine nuts toasted for extra crunch and flavor. Bake monitored by crust edges turning golden brown and cheese bubbling with slight browning. Rest pizza before slicing lets toppings set, avoiding steam sogginess."

ingredients:
- "2 tablespoons olive oil"
- "6 cups fresh baby spinach"
- "1 pizza dough ball or flatbread about 12 inches"
- "1 cup marinara sauce"
- "1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese"
- "1/2 cup crumbled goat cheese instead of feta"
- "1/3 cup roasted red peppers diced instead of sun-dried tomatoes"
- "1 medium fresh roma tomato sliced"
- "3 tablespoons fresh basil pesto"
- "2 tablespoons pine nuts toasted"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 425F. If using a pizza stone, place stone on middle rack and let heat 30 minutes minimum."
- "Heat olive oil in skillet over medium heat. Add spinach in batches if needed, toss until just wilted, bright green, and moisture mostly evaporated. Remove immediately to prevent stewing and water-logged crust later."
- "Stretch or roll out dough on floured surface to roughly 12 inches. Dock gently with fork to avoid large bubbles but keep some texture."
- "Transfer dough or flatbread to parchment or pizza peel. Spread marinara evenly but sparingly to avoid sogginess. Think thin veil, not a puddle."
- "Scatter shredded mozzarella all over sauce, covering edges slightly for crisp cheese-crusted crust edges."
- "Distribute wilted spinach evenly, then dot with crumbled goat cheese chunks. Goat cheese melts differently—keeps some creamy texture in bites."
- "Scatter roasted red peppers evenly for smoky sweetness. Add fresh roma tomato slices spaced apart to avoid excess moisture pooling."
- "Slide pizza onto preheated stone or baking sheet. Bake 13 to 16 minutes watching crust edges. Listen for a slight crackle and see cheese fully melted with edges bubbling and faint golden spots."
- "Remove pizza carefully. Dollop fresh pesto in small spoonfuls across top so each slice gets punch of herbaceous oil."
- "Sprinkle toasted pine nuts for crunch and nutty aroma that cuts richness. Let pizza rest 5 minutes on rack. Toppings settle, pizza slices cleaner cuts without messy, steaming toppings."
- "Slice with a sharp pizza wheel or serrated knife using a firm rocking motion to keep toppings intact."
introduction: "Spinach wilting in olive oil is step one for pizza that won’t get soggy. Avoid watery mess from raw greens dumped right on dough. Pizza stone preheated thoroughly means crust crispness. Dough stretched—not too thin—and docked to stop giant bubbles but retain an artisanal look. Sauce goes light and even, never a sloppy mess leaking underneath. Mozzarella and goat cheese mix gives creamy tang with melty action that surprises. Roasted red peppers instead of sun-dried. Fresh tomato slices, spaced, not overlapping in juicy islands. Baking resides between wait and watch—bubbling cheese with golden edges, crust crackle. Tossed with dollops of pesto and crunchy pine nuts, magic in the mouth. Resting must. Slice last, pizza juices settle, no drippy regrets."
ingredientsNote: "Spinach must be sautéed, no shortcuts. Raw dumps ruin base with water. Substitute arugula or kale if spinach scarce—adjust wilt times. Goat cheese swaps for feta offers creaminess, but feta stays fine if preferred. Roasted red peppers replace sun-dried tomatoes for smoky warmth; sun-dried more intense but drier, good for punch. Mozzarella is obligatory for melt and stretch; using fresh mozzarella adds moisture, so bake longer or pre-drain. Pine nuts toasted on dry pan until golden brown, smell guides timing—burn quickly. If pine nuts unavailable, chopped walnuts or almonds work but flavor differs. Use olive oil with strong aroma. Marinara should be thick little watery; homemade or jarred, reduce if thin by simmering briefly. Pizza dough: store-bought fine but stretch gently to prevent tearing. Flatbread as shortcut, but adjust sauce amount less to avoid sogginess."
instructionsNote: "Sauté spinach in olive oil until bright green and just wilted. Avoid overcooking or soggy spinach loses vibrancy and releases water in oven. Preheat to higher temp than usual—oven volatile; pizza stone helps retain heat—ensures bottom cooks before toppings overcook. Docking dough prevents tall annoying bubbles but keeps some air for texture—done with fork, don’t puncture too much. Sauce amount critical—too much leads to soggy crust edges, too little tastes dry. Cheese first locks in flavor base; goat cheese adds texture and tang in creamy pockets—don’t over spread, blobs better. Roasted red peppers give smoky depth and textural variation instead sun-dried tomatoes—less chewy. Fresh tomato slices spaced apart prevent pooling moisture, look for shiny but firm slices. Bake until cheese bubbling, slight gold edges, crust sound almost crackling when tapped. Dollops of fresh pesto add that pop after baking—heat kills basil vibrancy, so post-bake application best. Toast pine nuts on dry pan over medium, watch closely—once aroma hits and turns golden, remove immediately to avoid bitterness. Let baked pizza rest 5 minutes before slicing—keeps toppings neat and pizza easier to cut without all sliding off. Use pizza wheel or serrated knife with firm rocking motion to keep toppings intact."
tips:
- "Sauté spinach right. Use high heat. Cook quickly. Wilt just until bright green. Prevent mushy texture and extra moisture. Got to keep that crust crisp."
- "Dough stretching requires finesse. Not too thin; don’t tear; keep an edge. Dock with fork lightly. Avoid bubbling but retain texture. Let dough breathe."
- "Watch that sauce. Thin layer a must. No puddles! Marinara required to be thick, prevents sogginess. Go light on toppings; keep balance."
- "Timing is key with cheese. Mozzarella for melt, goat cheese adds tang; chunks stay creamy. Position evenly. Brown edges mean it's done right."
- "Don’t skip the resting. Let pizza sit after baking. Settle layers without steam making a mess. Slicing after rests keeps all toppings intact."
faq:
- "q: Why is my crust soggy? a: Likely too much sauce used or raw veggies on top. Sauté everything. Dock dough well. Precook stone if using."
- "q: Can I substitute goat cheese? a: Use feta, but expect different creaminess. Or, try ricotta for softer feel. Adjust spread method too."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Wrap well in foil. Store in fridge up to 3 days. Reheat in oven to regain crispiness. Microwave doesn’t work."
- "q: What if I can't find roasted red peppers? a: Use raw bell peppers for crunch. Or, sun-dried tomatoes if needed; flavors change. Adjust moisture."
