ingredients:
- "2 pork tenderloins about 400 g each"
- "20 ml olive oil"
- "15 ml unsalted butter"
- "4 shallots minced"
- "150 ml pure maple syrup"
- "20 ml grainy mustard"
- "15 ml cornstarch for dusting"
- "5 ml ground allspice powder"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 175 degrees Celsius with rack centered."
- "Pat pork dry, season lightly. Dust evenly with cornstarch, shake off excess—creates that light crust sealing in juices."
- "Heat oil and butter in ovenproof skillet over medium-high till shimmering and butter browning but not burnt."
- "Sear pork medallions 3–4 minutes each side. Watch for rich golden crust, meat surface tightening—not dark but good Maillard color. Salt and pepper after sear to avoid drawing moisture out prematurely."
- "Remove pork, tent loosely with foil, keep skillet on heat."
- "Add shallots; sweat gently until soft, translucent, smell sweet shalloty aroma and no browning."
- "Pour maple syrup, sprinkle allspice, then mustard. Stir and simmer 2–3 minutes till sauce thickens to coat back of spoon, glossy and a bit sticky."
- "Turn pork medallions into sauce, spoon to glaze thoroughly."
- "Transfer skillet to oven, roast 18–22 minutes. Test doneness by pressing meat—the flesh should yield slightly but spring back. Over 60°C internal, pink but not raw. Overcook beefy, dry."
- "Remove pork; cover with foil, rest 7 minutes minimum. Allows juices to redistribute. Crucial step to avoid dry slices."
- "Slice medallions thick or thin as preferred; serve with barley pilaf containing smoked bacon or a pumpkin puree drizzled with maple and cracked peppercorns."
- "Cleanup tip: If sauce sticks, add splash water to warm skillet and scrape gently."
introduction: "Pork tenderloin, lean and fast-cooking, demands careful attention to moisture and timing. Skip heavy marinades; dusting with cornstarch gives a subtle crust that locks in juices while promoting browning. Shallots bring sweetness without overpowering. Maple syrup, its characteristic caramel notes, balances with grainy mustard’s tang and a hint of warming allspice. Medium heat searing followed by oven roasting finalizes texture—no rushing or needle thermometers needed. Resting pork is non-negotiable—letting the meat relax keeps slices juicy, tender, inviting. The sauce, glossy and sticky, clings to meat like a shiny glaze, promising a bite that’s sweet, earthy, and sharp. Serve with barley pilaf studded with smoky bacon for textural contrast or a softly spiced squash puree to echo the maple note. Game-changer in everyday pork, multi-layered but straightforward. The aroma rising from skillet—honeyed, peppery—signals more than flavor; it’s the kitchen reading your next step."
ingredientsNote: "Why cornstarch instead of flour? Lighter coating, no heavy crust, better caramelization. Butter and olive oil combo—oil raises smoke point while butter adds depth and aroma, avoid burning both by medium-high heat only. Grainy mustard is essential for texture and punch; Dijon alone too slick, sweeter varieties dilute bite. Allspice optional but elevates maple notes without overwhelming. Substitute shallots with finely chopped red onion or leeks if needed, but keep longer cooking as they’re harsher. Pure maple syrup—not pancake syrup—impacts flavor profoundly; if unavailable, use honey plus a splash of apple cider vinegar for acidity. Salt late to avoid moisture leaching from meat, common mistake with tenderloin. Keep ingredients ready; timing is tight."
instructionsNote: "Preheat oven fully to ensure even roast; initial sear sets flavor and texture, don’t skip or crowd pan; space pork to get full crust. Watch butter closely during sear—browned butter adds nutty flavor but scorched butter ruins sauce. Shallots require patience—transparency without color. Sauce thickness is tactile; swirl the pan, look for coating that clings to spoon’s back. Oven process relies on meat’s bounce-back, not clock alone—avoid poking repeatedly, preserve juices. Resting not just hold; note meat fibers relax, texture smooths, slice yields more easily and looks perfect. When reheating leftovers, crisp quickly in pan to restore exterior texture. Backup: if no ovenproof skillet, transfer quickly to roasting pan after glazing. Toss anything burnt, start fresh with deglazing steps; caramelized bits make sauce gritty. Use thermometer if uncertain but favor feel and look. Timing tweaks based on pork thickness and starting temperature."
tips:
- "Ready the pork. Keep it dry. Season late to keep moisture locked. Dust with cornstarch for a crust; use it sparingly for best results. Watch cornstarch; thick but not too heavy. Sear medallions—great crust crucial."
- "Heat the pan, medium-high. Oil and butter combo? Yes. Don’t burn butter; keep an eye. Shimmering surface, things bubbling. Sear until golden, not dark. That Maillard reaction is your friend. Use salt after—don't draw moisture too soon."
- "Shallots take patience. Sweat gently till soft, translucent. No color, just sweetness. That aroma? It means you’re on track. Then pour the maple syrup; allspice in next. Simmer till thickens—stickiness means done. No rush."
- "Roast with care. Oven at 175°C. Push pork for spring-back test—doneness gauge; perfect yield too. If it’s overcooked—dried out—test again next time. Rest covered, letting juices redistribute is critical. Juicy slices matter."
- "Leftovers? Reheat in a pan. Crisp, not soggy. Good heat brings life back. Backup plan: If no ovenproof skillet? Just move pork to roasted pan once glazed. Sauce thick? Splash in some water while scraping bits off."
faq:
- "q: How do I keep pork tender? a: Resting is essential. If not? Juices escape. Timing counts. Don’t skip it."
- "q: Can I substitute shallots? a: Use red onion or leeks. Just adjust cooking time. Shallots are sweeter, those are sharper."
- "q: What if my sauce is too thin? a: Cook longer. Reduce by simmering. Stir often. For thicker, add cornstarch slurry; mix beforehand, though."
- "q: Storage recommendations? a: Keep in airtight container. Fridge? Up to three days. Freeze? Yes, up to three months."
