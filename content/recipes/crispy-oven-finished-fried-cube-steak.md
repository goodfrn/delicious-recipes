ingredients:
- "4 pounds cubed steak pieces"
- "Vegetable oil for frying"
- "1 ½ cups whole milk"
- "2 large eggs"
- "1 ½ cups all-purpose flour"
- "1 teaspoon smoked paprika"
- "1 teaspoon seasoned salt"
- "¾ teaspoon garlic powder"
- "¾ teaspoon onion powder"
- "¾ teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper"
- "1 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "5 tablespoons unsalted butter"
- "½ cup whole milk or half-and-half"
instructions:
- "===Preparation==="
- "Set oven to 360 Fahrenheit as you prep—slightly higher for better browning while finishing. Place a cooling rack over a sheet pan. Spray rack lightly with high-heat oil spray or brush with oil to prevent sticking. Keep nearby."
- "===Breading station==="
- "In a shallow dish, whisk whole milk and eggs into one mixture. In another, mix flour, smoked paprika, seasoned salt, garlic powder, onion powder, kosher salt, and black pepper evenly. The paprika replaces black pepper partly, adding a subtle smoky bite without overwhelming."
- "===Breading meat==="
- "One piece at a time—do not overcrowd your plate. Dredge cubed steak first in flour mixture; shake off excess but keep even coat. Dip next in milk-egg mixture, wipe off drips with fingers or lingering flour. Back into flour, pressing gently on edges to secure crust. Ends with flour to trap oil later and build the crust. Place breaded pieces neatly on rimmed tray."
- "===Heating oil==="
- "Use a deep heavy skillet or cast iron skillet 4 inches or deeper; heats more steadily. Pour enough vegetable oil to cover about an inch depth. Heat on medium-high to 355 Fahrenheit measured by a probe or thermometer tip. Hot enough to sizzle but not smoke; a small flour dab dropped should spike to surface quickly and brown in seconds. Adjust heat accordingly throughout frying."
- "===Frying=== "
- "Working in batches, place 2 to 3 pieces carefully without overcrowding. Listen for steady sizzle; loud bubbling means oil too hot, silence means low heat. Cook about 1 minute 40 seconds each side, flipping when edges firm and golden, surface bubbling slightly. Avoid overbrowning here because oven finish will deepen color. After flipping, crust gets crispier but remains tender under once baked. Drain briefly on paper towel or rack briefly to remove excess oil."
- "===Oven finish==="
- "Transfer all fried steaks to your prepped rack in the tray. Place in oven for 18 to 22 minutes, watching for internal firmness: if pressing edge yields some resistance, it’s done. Oven dries crust slightly creating texture contrast but avoids grease sogginess from pan frying alone."
- "===Gravy making==="
- "While steaks bake, melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Sprinkle in flour slowly, whisking continuously for 3 to 4 minutes or until the roux takes on a light tan, nutty aroma, avoid burning. Gradually pour in half a cup of milk or half-and-half off the heat at first to prevent lumps, then back to medium. Whisk constantly as mixture thickens, about five to seven minutes. Season with kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste. Keep warm, stir frequently to prevent skin forming. If gravy thickens too fast, thin with extra milk a tablespoon at a time."
- "===Serving==="
- "Remove steaks from oven, let rest 3 minutes on rack to maintain crust integrity. Plate individually, spoon warm gravy generously over each piece. Serve alongside mashed potatoes or corn for a rustic meal. Use visual and tactile cues more than timers—the crust color shifts from golden to slightly darker tan, gravy coats spoon cleanly. Adjust seasoning before plating if needed."
introduction: "No shortcuts. Fried cube steak demands attention—peanut oil heated right, breading done twice with precision, oven finish crucial. It’s about sight, sounds, textures. Sizzle, golden edges, crust that cracks but stays tender. Milk-egg-flour layering locks moisture in beef cubes. Duck eyes from lumps in gravy by gradual milk whisking. Swap paprika for bland black pepper edge. Use vegetable oil when peanut not at hand, but no less flavor. Crust thick enough to stand sauce without sogging instantly. Patience on oven finish—don’t rush or you’ll get greasy, chewy mess. It’s how you push crisp to next level while beef stays juicy inside. No marinades, no gimmicks. Technique and timing. Let oven and oil do the work. Gravy thickened just right coats meat on plate, thick but pourable."
ingredientsNote: "Cubed steak varies—thinner cuts dry out quickly, thicker may need extra oven time. Substitute vegetable oil if peanut unavailable; generally stable up to desired heat without smoking. The switch to smoked paprika adds complexity; try regular paprika if you want less bite. All-purpose flour important for breading texture—bread crumbs can dry out crust or burn fast. Double breading locks oil out and juice in. Milk egg mixture must be evenly mixed; lumps cause patchy crust. Butter for gravy chosen unsalted to control saltiness; half-and-half optional for richer texture but full milk works fine and saves fat. Adjust salt gradually."
instructionsNote: "Oil temperature monitoring vital—too hot crust burns outside, raw inside; too cool leads to soggy crust absorbing oil. Use thermometer or test with flour piece. Fry small batches only; overcrowding drops temperature and causes greasy crust. Crisp edges with tender centers key—achieved by shallow frying, not deep frying. Oven finish dries crust and finishes cooking meat gently, prevents toughness from over-frying. Gravy roux cooking is step ignored too often—undercooked flour tastes raw, burnt tastes bitter. Gradual milk addition, constant whisk needed for smooth gravy. Let steaks rest briefly post oven to lock juices and keep crust crisp. Serve immediately after, crusts don’t hold well warm long."
tips:
- "Watch that oil temp—355 Fahrenheit, sizzle not smoke. Quick flour test—should brown instantly. Don’t overcrowd frying pan, causes greasy crust."
- "Use thick bottom skillet. Heat evenly and retains temp better. Drain fried steaks on rack—absorb less grease. Let rest post oven for crust."
- "Bread twice, ensures oil out, juice in. Always dip back into flour last—captures moisture inside. Dredge lightly and evenly; no clumps."
- "When making gravy, slow milk addition vital. Whisk consistently to avoid lumps. Cook roux until light tan for best flavor—don’t rush."
- "Adjust seasoning in gravy gradually. Taste often. If thick, add milk tablespoon at a time. More broth doesn’t hurt if too salty."
faq:
- "q: How to know if cube steak is done? a: Use touch—firm but springy. Press edges and see resistance. Overcook and meat tough."
- "q: Issues with soggy crust? a: Fry in small batches for crispness. Too much batter leads to moisture. Touch checks help too."
- "q: How to store leftover steak? a: Refrigerate in airtight for 2-3 days. Reheat briefly in skillet, keeps crisp better than microwave."
- "q: Can I use other oils for frying? a: Yes, but peanut oil has high smoke point. Can also try canola or vegetable oil for less flavor."
