ingredients:
- "1 small yellow onion diced"
- "1 ½ cups chopped bell peppers mix of red and green"
- "1 cup fresh broccoli florets roughly chopped"
- "1 ½ cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese divided"
- "9 large eggs"
- "1 teaspoon ground mustard powder"
- "¾ cup half and half"
- "2 tablespoons whole wheat flour"
instructions:
- "Heat oven to 340 degrees F. Spray 9x13 casserole dish thoroughly. Don’t skimp here or bits will stick to dish and edges burn."
- "Mix onions, bell peppers, broccoli, and 1 cup shredded cheddar in dish. Spread evenly to maximize cheesey bites in every spoonful."
- "In separate bowl whisk eggs vigorously with mustard powder, half and half, and flour until batter is smooth and slightly frothy. Flour adds body so egg doesn’t weep water."
- "Pour mixture over the vegetable-cheese layer slowly, tilting dish if needed to distribute evenly. Lightly press veggies down with fork to submerge slightly."
- "Bake uncovered for 50 minutes. Surface will firm up and edges begin to pull away from pan. The center should jiggle just a little when nudged – sign it’s still creamy inside."
- "Remove from oven. Sprinkle remaining ½ cup cheese over top layer. Return to oven and bake 12 more minutes. Cheese melts and bubbles, browning lightly."
- "Let rest 7-12 minutes before slicing. Resting firms casserole and stops it falling apart under the knife. Aroma sharp cheddar and warm mustard powder rises."
- "Serve room warm or hot. Crispy edges and soft center contrast. Great with crusty bread or fresh fruit."
introduction: "Got a crowd to feed? Something that’s hands-off but shows you know your eggs? This casserole hits those boxes with solid veggie content and no fluff. Forget soggy bottoms and rubbery eggs – this delivers a firm but moist slice every time. Ground mustard lends subtle tang without overwhelming, while whole wheat flour keeps it from puddling or cracking. Shred your cheese fresh for melting magic. Use a heavy pan for even heat distribution. Bell peppers and broccoli turn tender but keep a bite, not mushy mush. Prep takes under half an hour if vegetables prepped ahead. Rest time is key; never skip it or the middle will fall apart when cut. You’ve got time on your side – while it bakes, coffee brews, knives sharpen, plates set. You'll be rewarded with bubbling cheese crust aroma wafting from the oven and edges that visually pull away crisp from the pan’s perimeter, signaling proper doneness. Serve with something acidic like sliced tomatoes or a vinegary slaw if you'd like to cut richness."
ingredientsNote: "Onions, peppers, and broccoli provide texture and freshness but feel free to swap. Use kale or spinach if broccoli is out. Replace bell peppers with diced zucchini or mushrooms if preferred. Sharp cheddar is classic here; goat cheese or gruyere adds sophistication but melts differently—expect softer texture and shorter bake time if swapping. Half and half can be substituted with whole milk or cream based on richness desired, but adjust flour quantity accordingly if too thin or thick. Whole wheat flour absorbs moisture better than all-purpose here; all-purpose can be used but risks slightly more sogginess. Ground mustard powder adds flavor punch but may replace with ½ teaspoon dry mustard or a light sprinkle of turmeric to boost color without adding heat."
instructionsNote: "Spraying the casserole dish prevents the egg mixture from sticking while developing a nicely caramelized cheese crust on the edges. Spreading the vegetables evenly keeps consistent texture throughout each serving. Whisking eggs with mustard powder wakes up flavor molecules and thickens mixture gently, helping custard hold shape during baking. Adding flour stabilizes the bake, reducing watery leaks common in egg-heavy dishes. Pouring mixture slowly over vegetables avoids floating chunks or separation. Baking at moderate temperature allows the custard to set firmly without burning or drying out. Reliable doneness signals: edges firm and pulling slightly from the pan, center jiggles faintly when nudged, top cheese bubbling and browning. Adding cheese after initial bake ensures crisp golden topping, not burnt through. Resting the casserole for several minutes post-oven lets the proteins settle and prevents crumbling during slicing. Use a sharp serrated knife for clean cuts. If edges cook faster than center next time, tent dish with foil for part of bake to avoid over-browning. Leftovers reheat well wrapped in foil, retain texture if gently warmed. A blowtorch on cheese finish elevates presentation but isn’t required."
tips:
- "Use fresh cheese. Pre-grated often has anti-caking agents. Fresh melts better, creates that gooey texture everyone loves. Don’t overlook that."
- "Cooking veggies beforehand helps flavor. Sauteing or steaming lightly can enhance. If using frozen, thaw and dry well. Water ruins texture."
- "Consider swapping out half and half. Milk or cream work but adjust flour. Too thin, runny bake. Too thick, it’ll overpower flavor."
- "Check for doneness by jiggling center lightly. It should wobble a bit but not overly liquid. Edges pulling away? Good sign it’s cooking right."
- "Resting is crucial. Let sit before slicing. Cuts cleanly if proteins settle. Otherwise, a crumble mess. Give it 10 minutes at least."
faq:
- "q: Can I use other vegetables? a: Yes. Spinach, zucchini work well. Just keep moisture in check. Too much water makes the bake soggy."
- "q: What if I don’t have cheddar? a: Substitute with gruyere or goat cheese. Watch cooking time. Melt times differ, might need adjustments."
- "q: How long do leftovers last? a: Keep in fridge for 3-4 days. Can freeze too, but texture may change. Reheat gently, avoid drying out."
- "q: What if it looks undercooked? a: Jiggle test helps. If center wobbles, cooks more after removed. If edges firm, might just need more time."
