ingredients:
- "===Fried Wonton Strips==="
- "5 wonton wrappers, thawed, sliced 1cm strips"
- "180 ml canola oil"
- "pinch salt and pepper"
- "===Fried Tofu==="
- "1 block 420g firm tofu (pressed, well drained)"
- "90 g corn starch"
- "8 ml powdered sugar"
- "6 ml baking powder"
- "1 ml smoked paprika"
- "===Filling==="
- "10 round rice paper sheets (23cm diameter)"
- "30 fresh mint leaves"
- "10 Boston lettuce leaves"
- "2 Lebanese cucumbers, julienned"
- "2 medium carrots, julienned"
- "1 batch quick-pickled kohlrabi (see note)"
- "1 batch spiced lime peanut sauce (see note)"
instructions:
- "===Prepare Fried Wonton Strips==="
- "Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over high heat until shimmering but not smoking. Fry wonton strips in batches. They must sizzle audibly; 2-3 minutes stirring half-way until deeply golden and blistered. Drain carefully on paper towels. Salt lightly. Set aside. Saves as crunchy contrast; don’t overcrowd pan or strip sogginess ensues."
- "===Fried Tofu==="
- "Cut drained tofu into matchsticks approximating 6 x 1 cm. Pat dry thoroughly between paper towels. Moisture ruins crust. Mix corn starch, powdered sugar, baking powder, and paprika in bowl; toss tofu sticks until thoroughly coated. Shake off excess – heavy coating clogs oil and tastes doughy."
- "Pour reserved wonton oil back to pan, heat medium-high. Needs at least 1 cm depth. Fry half tofu at a time. Do not crowd. About 5–7 mins total, turn regularly to bronze all sides. Listen. Soft crackling means correct heat. Remove with slotted spoon to paper towels. Golden with crisp exterior but soft center. Repeat."
- "===Assemble Rolls==="
- "Soak rice paper one at a time in a bowl of warm water just until flexible, about 10 seconds. Do not oversoak; becomes gummy and tears. Lay flat on board."
- "Layer 1 leaf lettuce at bottom third of wrapper. Center 3 mint leaves, 2 tofu sticks, and 3 fried wonton strips horizontally. Add small piles cucumber, carrot, and pickled kohlrabi. Roll tightly like burrito, folding ends in to encase filling. Place seam side down on damp towel. Do not stack; cover with moist cloth to keep pliable. Rolls best eaten fresh within hours—paper turns gummy in fridge."
- "===Finishing==="
- "Half each roll diagonally just before serving. Arrange on platter with dipping sauce. Rich, tart peanut sauce balances crunch and herbaceous coolness."
- "===Note:Quick-Pickled Kohlrabi==="
- "Thinly slice kohlrabi, submerge in vinegar, pinch salt, touch sugar, small chili slivers if you like. Marinate min 30 minutes, longer for punchier. Can swap with daikon or radish."
- "===Note: Spiced Lime Peanut Sauce==="
- "Blend creamy peanut butter, lime juice, soy sauce, minced garlic, a dash of maple syrup, water to thin, and cayenne or chili flakes for heat. Adjust balance individually. Keeps well chilled."
introduction: "Crunch: frying wonton strips adds much more than garnish; that sizzle and golden flakes anchoring mouthfeel. Tofu texture is everything—pressed, dried, then dusted in starch plus baking powder helps achieve blistery crust while keeping interior tender. Quick-pickling replaces traditional carrot or cucumber acid note with sharper kohlrabi brightness, adding crunch and color. Rice papers rehydrated just enough to bend without tearing—too long and they lose structure; too short they crack when rolling. Serving fresh is non-negotiable; these rolls weep moisture fast and become limp. Peanut sauce twists with lime and heat, brightening whole dish. Efficient mise-en-place ensures timing sync. Salty, sweet, tangy, herbaceous, textural interplay at every bite. Don’t under-season components; subtle layers matter. Technique beats time. Listen for oil crackles, watch for those translucent oil bubbles around tofu edges as sign of proper frying, smell deep fried starch notes, check wonton crispness visually and by snap."
ingredientsNote: "Wonton wrappers available pre-frozen; thaw fully before slicing or they'll tear. Can substitute tapioca starch if corn starch unavailable; expect slightly different texture in tofu crust. Reducing oil quantity is tempting—maintain full depth for frying or coating suffers. For oil reuse, strain well and store. Herbs—mint preferred for cool freshness but sub cilantro if unavailable. Lettuce Boston type chosen for tender pliability; iceberg too crisp, leaf lettuce too fragile. Kohlrabi quick-pickle replaces radish or daikon, providing sharper crunch but balance sweetness in pickling liquid carefully. Peanut sauce can swap peanut butter for almond or sunflower seed butter for nut-free option, adjust seasoning accordingly. Pat tofu thoroughly dry—wet tofu fries greasy and soggy. Sugar powder in coating plays role in color and caramelization—don’t skip."
instructionsNote: "Fry wonton strips first to make use of fresh oil and avoid using additional fats multiple times. Listen for steady crackling sound under high heat as indicator. Toss gently to avoid breaking fragile strips. For tofu, temperature precision crucial—too hot burns starch outer shell inside raw; too cold absorbs oil and becomes limp. Work in batches, don’t crowd pan. Flip carefully with slotted spoon; flipping too often prevents crust formation and risks falling apart. Rice paper rehydration: where most fail—dip firmly but brief; patience essential, they stiffen when cold but soften quickly. Roll tight but gentle to avoid tearing. Cover assembled rolls with damp cloth prevents drying but no stacking or they stick and lose shape. Assemble just before serving to keep crispness and illusion of freshness. Peanut sauce: add liquid sparingly—thickness influences dipping experience. Stir well and taste-test, balancing acidity and sweetness. Slight heat marries best with crunchy tofu and fresh herbs. Visual cues—deep golden crust, transparent oil bubbles, and matte surface over shiny oil signal correct frying completion. Letting tofu rest on paper towels prevents soggy bottoms. Knife skills for julienne matter; uniformity helps packing rolls tidy. Use clumsy folds will lead to ruptures and leaking fillings."
tips:
- "Fry wonton strips first; use a deep enough oil level. Watch for those golden edges. Drain well on paper towels. That crunch adds contrast. Never overcrowd."
- "Press tofu thoroughly—removes moisture. Essential for frying. Corn starch coating helps crisp outside. Listen for the crackling sound—sign of heat right."
- "Rehydrate rice paper just enough. Dip briefly. Too long, they turn gummy. Lay flat; avoid stacking. Cover with damp cloth as you work—keeps pliable."
- "Use kohlrabi for that unique zing. Try daikon if needed. Quick-pickle it; salt, sugar, vinegar. Let it sit. Marinate longer for more punch in flavor."
- "Peanut sauce balance is crucial. Adjust acidity and sweetness to taste. Use creamy nut butter, or swap for seed butter. Mix till silky—thinning if required."
faq:
- "q: How to handle soggy tofu? a: Ensure it's pressed well. Pat dry. Too much moisture ruins frying. Starch needs to cling. Make sure coating's light."
- "q: Can I prep these rolls ahead? a: Rolling too early leads to gummy wrappers. Best made fresh. Assemble close to serving time. Keep covered with damp cloth."
- "q: What if my rolls crack when rolling? a: Damp rice paper helps. Don't oversoak. Roll tightly but gently; it’s about tension. If still cracks, try shorter dip."
- "q: Storage tips for leftovers? a: Refrigerate wrapped in damp cloth. But they get limp fast. Best eaten same day. Can store sauce separate for freshness."
