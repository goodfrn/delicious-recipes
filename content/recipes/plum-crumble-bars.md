ingredients:
- "160 grams unbleached all-purpose flour"
- "120 grams quick-cooking rolled oats"
- "3 grams baking powder"
- "1 pinch salt"
- "80 grams unsalted butter softened"
- "50 grams coconut oil softened"
- "120 grams maple syrup"
- "1 large egg"
- "350 grams firm ripe plums pitted and diced (about 6 medium)"
- "90 grams granulated sugar"
- "10 ml arrowroot powder"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 175 degrees Celsius. Position rack mid-level. Butter 28 x 20 cm glass dish. Line with parchment paper strips overlapping edges leaving overhang."
- "Combine flour, oats, baking powder, salt in large mixing bowl. Stir to blend evenly."
- "In separate bowl, beat butter, coconut oil with maple syrup until fluffy. Add egg, continue to mix until homogeneous."
- "Stir in dry ingredients with wooden spoon. Reserve about one-third dough."
- "Press two-thirds dough firmly into bottom of prepared pan. Press slightly up sides to create shallow edge."
- "Toss diced plums with sugar and arrowroot powder in third bowl until evenly coated."
- "Spread plum filling over pressed dough layer carefully."
- "Crumble reserved dough evenly on top over fruit layer."
- "Bake 50 minutes. Crust and topping should be golden and set."
- "Let cool in pan, 20 minutes minimum before lifting with parchment paper edges."
- "Cut into twelve squares. Serve warm or room temperature."
introduction: "Fruit dessert bars. Oats and flour mixed in a two-layer pastry. Butter cut with coconut oil adds subtle depth. Sweetness not all from brown sugar anymore, now partly maple syrup. Leavening switches from soda to powder, gentle lift, less bite. Plums diced, dense but firm, coated with arrowroot to hold juices without sogginess. Pie vs crumble balance achieved by amount pressed and crumbly bits on top. Bakes just under an hour to golden crust, fruit bubbling within. Thick squares, a little messier than cake but more rustic. Dairy-free option intact. Nut-free safer. A glimpse toward easy, casual fruit desserts, less fuss, more texture interplay. Half fruit, half crumb, all comfort."
ingredientsNote: "Adjust flour and oats ratio first for sturdiness in crust and topping. Avoid over-softening coconut oil to keep texture crumbly, not greasy. Maple syrup gives distinct sweetness and moisture versus dry sugars, so less granulated sugar in the filling balances overall sugar load. Arrowroot powder handles fruit juices without flavor interference, preferred over cornstarch. Use firm-ripe plums for texture, too ripe turns filling runny, less distinct. Butter softened but not melted blends better with coconut oil and syrups. Steps note partial pressing and crumbling. Parchment helps with clean squares. Sizes suit 28x20cm baking dish but adjustments possible. Mixture of textures, firm bottom, juicy middle, rough top."
instructionsNote: "Care in pressing dough for bottom layer crucial. Too thin risks sogginess under fruit. Reserve about one-third dough for top crumble, coarse crumbling adds texture contrast. Cinnamon or nutmeg spice optional but changes flavor profile. Fruit mixed with sweetener and arrowroot powder before layering prevents separating and runny fruit juices. Bake time slightly extended, oven temps tweaked - 175C ensures gradual browning. Leaving bars to cool in pan allows set-up before slicing, cutting warm makes squares lose shape. Lifting parchment edges helps remove entire slab. Straight cuts, squared, after cooling gives neat shapes even if top crumb is rustic sensibility. Serve slightly warm or cold, holds shape better cold."
tips:
- "Be careful with the dough pressing. Firm and even. Too thin, soggy base. Make edge higher for better structure. It's all in the technique. Lots of pressure helps. Too soft makes it run away."
- "Take time with the fruit. Choose firm-ripe plums. Overripe ones turn mushy, flavor dulls. Diced but not too small. Mix with sugar and arrowroot well. Let juices blend before layering."
- "Baking time, watch closely. Oven heat varies. Golden brown is key. Let cool in pan but don’t rush. Cooling is crucial. Warm cutting leads to crumbling. Clean cuts stay neat. Parchment helps lift."
- "Make adjustments for size if needed. The baking dish can change. Try 22 x 18 cm. But keep ratios balanced. Too much crumb, it overflows. Or crust crumbles. Finding that balance matters."
- "Don’t forget spices if desired. Cinnamon or nutmeg add warmth. But too much changes the whole thing. Next time, maybe skip sweetener too. Play with flavors and find what works."
faq:
- "q: How to prevent soggy bars? a: Firm pressing necessary. Avoid over-softening oils. Let fruit juice mix with arrowroot before layering. Helps keep consistency."
- "q: Can I use other fruits? a: Yes, but variations matter. Apples work well. Berries, try, but cook times adjust. Always keep texture in mind. Too juicy, too runny."
- "q: How to store leftover bars? a: Keep in airtight container. Or in fridge if needing longer life. Freezing is also an option. Just thaw, don’t refreeze."
- "q: What to serve with these bars? a: Try vanilla ice cream, or yogurt. Fresh cream works well too. Cold combinations make a difference. Vanilla brings out the plums."
