slug: "crunchy-panettone-brioche"
description: "Yeasted brioche dough steeped in macerated citrus peels and dried cherries plus whiskey. Folded with softened ghee and honey instead of butter and sugar. Rested with a longer cold ferment. Dough divided into balls, dipped in spiced brown butter and coarse sugar. Baked in muffin tins lined with parchment squares until golden brown with crackling sugar crust. Warm aromas of vanilla, orange zest, with a hint of whiskey. Can swap ghee for coconut oil, dried cranberries for cherries. Timing guided by dough volume doubling and crust color. Simple, rustic but with a layered aroma profile and a crisp sugar shell."

ingredients:
- "100 ml (7 tbsp) mixed citrus peels, drained, chopped"
- "60 g (1/3 cup) dried cherries, soaked"
- "20 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) whiskey"
- "200 ml (7/8 cup) warm whole milk, around 38°C"
- "8 ml (1 3/4 tsp) instant yeast"
- "2 large eggs, room temperature"
- "25 ml (1 2/3 tbsp) avocado oil or neutral oil"
- "12 ml (2 1/2 tsp) vanilla extract"
- "10 ml (2 tsp) orange blossom water or grated zest of 2 lemons"
- "490 g (3 1/4 cups) all-purpose flour, unbleached"
- "80 g (1/3 cup) honey"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) fine sea salt"
- "115 g (1/2 cup) ghee, softened"
- "=== Enrobage ==="
- "60 g (1/4 cup plus 1 tsp) spiced brown butter, warm"
- "90 g (1/2 cup) coarse raw sugar, plus extra for dusting"
instructions:
- "=== Brioche dough ==="
- "1. Soak citrus peels and cherries in whiskey at least 20 minutes. The alcohol softens fruit, extracts flavor, little kick left. Drain well before adding to dough to avoid soggy pockets."
- "2. Warm milk about body temperature (38°C), not too hot or it kills yeast. Stir in yeast, wait 7 minutes until foaming or slight bubbles show yeast is active."
- "3. Whisk eggs, oil, vanilla, orange blossom water or lemon zest into milk-yeast mixture until uniform. This liquid fat plus flavor base is key for tender crumb."
- "4. Mix flour, honey, salt in your stand mixer bowl. Using dough hook, add wet mixture gradually. The dough initially looks shaggy, sticky. Scrape sides, keep mixing. Once flour is hydrated, start adding softened ghee in chunks, one piece at a time."
- "5. Knead 6-7 minutes on low speed. Dough should be tacky but elastic, pulling without tearing immediately. Too dry and bruised or too wet and sloppy won't rise right."
- "6. Fold in macerated fruit carefully by hand at the end. Distribute evenly but avoid overmixing and breaking up fruit pieces."
- "7. Transfer dough to a lightly greased bowl. Cover tightly with plastic or damp tea towel. Let proof at room temp (around 22°C) for 6-7 hours until doubled. Cooler temp slower take longer, can retard in fridge overnight—improves flavor complexity and texture."
- "=== Preparation ==="
- "8. Prepare enrobage: gently brown butter until nutty aroma, taking care not to burn. Stir in warm. Pour into a shallow bowl. Coarse sugar in another bowl nearby."
- "9. Turn dough onto a floured surface, cut into 12 equal pieces with a bench scraper. Shape loosely into tight balls by cupping hands and rolling the dough with gentle pressure — little tension to get smooth top but not tight dough balls that resist rising."
- "10. Dip each ball first into spiced brown butter then roll in coarse sugar until fully coated. Sugar creates that crisp shell that crackles when you bite in. Don’t skimp here."
- "11. Place each sugared ball on individual 15 cm squares of parchment paper. Arrange in muffin tin cavities. Press lightly to flatten just a bit, helps with uniform oven spring and shape."
- "12. Cover loosely with a damp towel or plastic wrap sprayed with oil to avoid sticking. Proof in a warm (~27°C) humid spot 40 minutes or until nearly doubled. Poking gently with fingertip leaves a springy crown, dough recovers slowly."
- "=== Baking ==="
- "13. Preheat oven and rack to 175°C, center placement. Have a baking sheet under muffin pan to catch any drips or overflow sugar."
- "14. Sprinkle each brioche top with extra coarse sugar for crunch and shine."
- "15. Bake 27-30 minutes until tops deep golden brown and brittle to touch. The sugar crystals caramelize, making an audible crack and sharp contrast to pillowy crumb inside."
- "16. Remove from oven, let cool on rack at least 30 minutes before peeling parchment. Cooling solidifies crust and prevents soggy bottoms."
- "17. Serve warm-ish with butter or plain. Over time brioche loses crispness; reheat briefly in oven if necessary to revive the sugar shell crackle."

introduction: "Brioche dough slathered with sweetened fruit bites. Citrus peels soak in whiskey for richness, merging with cherry's chew. Longer, cooler proof develops nuanced crumb flavor—you can almost smell it rising, warm and yeasty. Ghee adds a nuttier fat profile than butter; honey instead of refined sugar for moist crumb. The hard sugar coating crackles under tooth, a textural surprise that contrasts soft interior. Folding in fruit last avoids breaking them down. Parchment squares for easy lift out, muffins tins ensure shape and heat circulation. Learn to judge rise by gentle poke, not blindly timing. Golden crust signals caramelized top, sticky sweet bits ready. No fluff, just method and senses working together."
ingredientsNote: "Fruit infusion liquids like rum or whiskey add depth but substitute brandy or amaretto for a flavor tweak. Citrus peels canned or homemade—rinsed to cut excess sugar—add brightness and texture. Ghee used for its high smoke point and deeper flavor, replace with softened butter or coconut oil if needed. Honey replaces granulated sugar here to keep crumb moist and tender; if unavailable, use light brown sugar but expect firmer crumb. Instant yeast for speed, oxidizes less than active dry; adjust proofing accordingly if swapping. Flower waters are key for floral aroma—use orange blossom or lemon verbena extract, or zest for fresh citrus hit. Coarse sugar is critical for top crunch; don't substitute fine sugar without crushing or it'll melt away. Patience pays; do not rush proofing for best lift and texture."
instructionsNote: "Start by soaking fruits thoroughly in spirit to extract flavor and soften texture. Proper milk temp critical to train yeast without killing. Add fats after initial flour hydration for well-structured crumb; slowly incorporating fat ensures gluten develops strong but tender network. Knead moderately but don’t overwork. Shape dough gently to maintain air pockets. Rest overnight in cool allows enzymatic activity, better flavors form. Use parchment squares to avoid sticking and ease removal, muffin pan prevents spreading, gives height. Brown butter gives complex nutty taste, watch color—too dark is bitter. Proof until nearly doubled, test by finger dent that rebounds slowly, not disappears or stays. Sprinkle sugar last moment to avoid burning. Oven temp moderate for even browning without burning sugar crust. Cool on rack—hot sugar crust brittle, cool it to set solid. Reheating in low oven refreshes crunch if brioche aged. Using sensory signs over strict timing helps adapt in real kitchens with variable conditions."
tips:
- "Start with soaking fruits. Whiskey or rum works. Drain them afterward—keeps dough from getting soggy. Check for flavors and balance."
- "Milk temp matters. Warm, like body heat. Too hot? Yeast dies. Ensure it bubbles after adding yeast. Good signs of active yeast."
- "Incorporate softened ghee gradually. Avoid adding too fast—gluten needs time to develop. Tacky but not too sticky is key for dough."
- "Proof dough based on volume, not rigid times. Risen enough if doubles in size. Cooler places slow down process—might need more time."
- "Sugar coating is crucial. Stick with coarse raw sugar for that crackle. Fine sugar melts too quickly, won’t give desired texture."
faq:
- "q: How long should I soak the fruits? a: At least 20 minutes, honey with whiskey or rum extracts flavors. Maybe overnight for deeper flavors."
- "q: Can I use other fruits? a: Yes, try dried cranberries or apricots. Adjust soaking time for them. Texture and taste change a bit."
- "q: What if my dough doesn't rise? a: Check yeast freshness, wrong temperature can wreck it. Need warmth, humidity—try again with patience."
- "q: Storage for leftovers? a: Keep in an airtight container—freshness dips. Refrigerate for longer life but can lose texture. Reheat to revive."
