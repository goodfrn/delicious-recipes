ingredients:
- "525 ml rosé wine"
- "75 g sugar"
- "225 g raspberries"
- "225 ml water"
- "15 ml lime juice"
- "5 fresh basil leaves"
instructions:
- "Pour rosé and sugar in glass container. Stir vigorously till sugar dissolves. Cover loosely. Freeze 9 hours or till fully frozen."
- "In blender, combine raspberries, water, lime juice, and basil leaves. Pulse until combined but not pureed fully, leave some texture."
- "Scrape frozen rosé mixture, break into chunks, add to blender. Blend quickly until slushy, not watery. Stop and stir if needed."
- "Spoon into glasses, garnish with basil leaf or lime wedge. Serve immediately before melting."
introduction: "Cold, fruity, and buzz-filled. Wine meets summer. No fuss freezing. Sugar cut down to tame sweetness. Not strawberries but raspberries. Swapped citrus from lemon to lime. Basil sneaks in, herbal sharpness. A frozen cocktail of color and chill for warm nights. Pour, freeze, blitz, drink. Stubborn sugar dissolves slow. Ice forms thick and hard. Blend quick. Texture—icy slush, bits of fruit still clinging. A cocktail that's both wine and sorbet, cutting edge and casual. Quickly shifts moods from thirst to party. Slushy yet elegant. Bursting with red fruit and sharp herb. Give it time. Freeze longer than usual, blend less. Basil leaf gets the fancy nod."
ingredientsNote: "Cutting sugar a bit helps keep it from clumpy ice blocks. Raspberries replace strawberries adding a deeper, tangier note and more seeds for texture. Fresh basil, torn or whole, brightens the flavors and offsets sweetness with herbal freshness. Lime juice sharper than lemon adds crisp acidity. Water dilutes the puree just enough, making the slush blend smooth but not too watery once frozen rosé added in. The rosé quantity reduced by 30% to keep the sweetness and chill balanced. All ingredients should be chilled beforehand for best freezing results."
instructionsNote: "Start by mixing sugar and rosé thoroughly so sugar dissolves fully before freezing. Freeze longer than usual for denser ice. Churn or scrape every 3-4 hours if possible to break big crystals. For blender step, start with puree of fruits and herbs to avoid completely smooth mix—tiny chunks add texture contrast. Add frozen rosé cubes last to keep slush consistency, blend short bursts only lest mixture turns watery. Serve immediately to maintain slush texture before melting sets in. Garnishing with fresh basil or lime wedge ties in flavors visually and aromatic."
tips:
- "First, get everything cold before you start. Chilling all ingredients really helps. It contributes to better freezing results. Keep the rosé in the fridge a while. Even the water. Don't skip this part. Skip it and you might struggle later."
- "For better slush texture, freeze longer. Don't rush the process. Let the rosé and sugar blend freeze fully. It needs time to become dense ice. This isn't a quick blend and go. Churn or break big ice every few hours. It really helps."
- "When blending, start with the fruits and herbs first. Don't over-puree. Keep some texture. The frozen rosé goes in later. Add it last, in chunks. Quick blends only. If you blend too long, it might become runny. Not the goal here."
- "Garnishing can enhance the drink's look and flavor. Use fresh basil leaves or a lime wedge. It ties in the herbal and tart notes. Presentation matters. That's part of enjoyment. Simple touches can elevate the drink."
- "Serve immediately after blending. Slush melts quickly. Aim to consume right away. Slushy, icy, that's the goal. The longer it sits, the less icy. A little effort now saves disappointment later."
faq:
- "q: How can I adjust sweetness? a: Alter sugar amount. Reduce if desired. Use sweet fruits. Note varieties can change sweetness. Explore preferences."
- "q: Can I use other fruits? a: Yes, mix and match. Blackberries or blueberries work. Consider seasonal fruits for variety. Just keep balance in mind."
- "q: What's the best storage method? a: Store in freezer in airtight container. Ensure it's sealed to avoid ice crystals. But for best taste, consume fresh."
- "q: Can I prepare this ahead of time? a: Yes, freeze the rosé mixture in advance. Just blend before serving. Don't freeze slush for long-term; texture suffers."
