description: "Tomatoes, slow-baked at low heat until caramelized, take on deep sweetness and a tender texture. Uses canned whole plum tomatoes, drained and halved; a drizzle of walnut oil replaces olive for a nuttier aroma. Tossed with thyme sprigs and garlic slices for an herby twist. Cooked until wrinkles appear and surface browns lightly, texture turns yielding but not mushy. Great for pasta, sandwiches, or tossed in bean salads. Keeps well refrigerated, a versatile pantry upgrade. Practical, straightforward, zero fuss. Avoid watery tomatoes by draining thoroughly, blot if needed. Saves excess juice for stocks or sauces. Low oven temp cooks gently without bursting skins or losing shape."

ingredients:
- "1 can 710 ml (24 oz) whole peeled tomatoes"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) walnut oil"
- "1 garlic clove thinly sliced"
- "2 sprigs fresh thyme"
- "Salt"
- "Pepper"
instructions:
- "Set oven rack center level. Preheat oven to 140 C 285 F, low and slow approach prevents scorching, preserves form."
- "Drain tomatoes in fine mesh over bowl. Reserve juice. Gently break each tomato in half, scoop out excess seeds and watery pulp if present; result is concentrated flesh, no sogginess."
- "Lay tomatoes cut side up on parchment-lined baking sheet. Use paper towel to blot any residual moisture from cut surfaces, important to avoid steaming in oven."
- "Nestle thyme sprigs and garlic slices among tomatoes. Drizzle evenly with walnut oil, season with salt and cracked black pepper. The oil type impacts aroma; walnut oil adds warm nuttiness, alternative to olive oil."
- "Place in oven, bake 1 hour 10 minutes. Do not rush. Watch for surface to show slight wrinkles, edges caramelizing to deep orange-brown spots. Tomato skin may shrivel beautifully but not burst. Aroma will fill kitchen – sweet, nutty, garlic uplift."
- "Remove, cool slightly. Tomatoes should be tender but hold shape, flesh sticky yet not falling apart. Use tongs to lift gently to avoid breaking. If too watery, roast longer; too dark, reduce time next attempt."
- "Store in airtight container with some of the baking juices for moisture. Keeps well chilled several days."
- "Use in pasta tossed simply with fresh basil, grilled bread crowned with feta and these tomatoes, or mixed warm into bean salad with lemon vinaigrette."
- "If lacking walnut oil, light toasted sesame or hazelnut oil make good substitutes; avoid overpowering oils. Thyme can be swapped for oregano or rosemary for different herbal notes."
- "If canned tomatoes are very watery, strain longer or pat dry to avoid diluted flavor and soggy texture after baking."
introduction: "Canned tomatoes don't have to be soggy, bland blobs you throw into sauce to mask their flaws. Slow roasting turns them into jewel-toned bites bursting with concentrated sweetness and just a hint of caramel. No frantic cooking, no high heat that blasts moisture and breaks skins. Time and low temper. That’s the secret. You’ll spot it in the shrinking skins, slight golden spots appearing–signals you're on the right track. The smell, too, tells you the truth. Confiting means partial dehydration and flavor concentration in gentle oil bath but done in oven, you get dry caramel notes rather than greasy softness. The garlic slices and thyme wedged between add layers. Simple tweak: walnut oil instead of olive for earthier shorter chain fatty acids and subtle nuttiness, little-known powerhouse pairing with tomato acidity. Hold the juice for soups or risotto; skinny tomatoes bake sweet, but the leftover liquor still packs punch, not to waste it. Mind the residual water; blotting payoffs dividends in texture and flavors that cling. Ideas expand: thread into sandwiches, toss with cold beans, scatter on cheesy croquettes. Versatile, forgiving technique useful all year, practical when fresh fruit fades. Kitchen-tested, zero guesswork."
ingredientsNote: "Start with quality canned whole tomatoes, not crushed or diced–the intact fruit keeps texture better when baked slow. 710 ml cans usually standard and slightly less volume than original but adjust time or amount accordingly. Walnut oil chosen here for its aromatic depth; substitutes like hazelnut or toasted sesame oil give similar layered nuances. Olive oil brings familiar fruitiness, okay if preferred but skip cheap, bitter versions. Thyme is subtle, woody; rosemary would overwhelm. Fresh slices of garlic introduce garlic aroma without raw sharpness; powder isn't a substitute here. Salt and pepper—simple seasonings but critical to balance sweetness. Keeping the tomato juice for other uses means no waste, adds kitchen economy. Drain thoroughly or blot tomatoes or else roasting creates too much steam, defeating dry confit texture aim. Baking sheet lined with parchment for easy cleanup and prevents sticking. The little details count, avoid soggy tomato mess or greasy puddles under fruit."
instructionsNote: "Low temp cook with patience key. 140 C won't blister tomatoes fast like high heat but allows gradual moisture evaporation. You watch the peel wrinkle, caramel spots bloom–visual signs trump rigid time schedules. Opening tomatoes and removing excess watery seeds helps intensify the resulting mouthfeel and flavor; otherwise you get watered-down glop. Blotting is worth extra seconds—water is the enemy here. Drizzle oil evenly to coat and lubricate, prevents burning and adds richness; oil pools mean uneven cooking. Nestling herbs and garlic burst subtle fragrant layers during slow roasting while avoiding burning is reason for low temp. Pull out when skins are shriveled but intact, tomatoes yield gently to touch but keep shape. Too long and tomatoes disintegrate or taste bitter. Store in container with some pan juice to keep moist but not swimming. Flavor keeps developing chilled over days. Substitute herbs to suit pantry. By emphasizing looks, feel and aroma over timing you get consistent, high quality outcome. Common pitfalls–canned tomato quality, excess juice, uneven oil coverage, too high heat–all undermine end result. Master these for reliable confited tomatoes every time."
tips:
- "Quality canned tomatoes shine. Go for whole peeled, not crushed. Keep texture intact. Drain well. Watery pulp leads to mess."
- "Blot cut tomatoes with paper towels. Steaming ruins the caramelizing process. Get moisture out for deeper flavors and better texture."
- "Watch your oven temp. Low heat maintains shape, won’t burst skins. Look for wrinkles and golden spots as cues for readiness."
- "Storage is key. Keep confited tomatoes in airtight containers. Add some baking juice for moisture. Flavors deepen over days."
- "Substitutions matter. If walnut oil isn't available, try toasted sesame or light hazelnut oil. Avoid heavy oils, they overpower."
