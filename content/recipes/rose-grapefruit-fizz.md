ingredients:
- "40 ml (1 1/3 oz) water tonic === split between glasses"
- "4 ice cubes"
- "85 ml (3 oz) rosé wine"
- "45 ml (1 1/2 oz) gin"
- "70 ml (2 1/3 oz) grapefruit juice"
- "15 ml (3 tsp) honey syrup"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) orange blossom water"
- "2 star anise pods === lightly crushed"
- "2 tbsp aquafaba === substitute for 1 egg white"
- "few dried rose petals"
- "2 grapefruit zest twists === long and thin"
instructions:
- "Start with chilled wine glasses. Pour half the tonic water into each glass."
- "In a shaker, add ice cubes, rosé wine, gin, grapefruit juice, honey syrup, orange blossom water, star anise pods, and aquafaba."
- "Shake vigorously for about 25 seconds, until frothy."
- "Strain carefully to avoid star anise pieces. Divide the liquid evenly into the glasses over the tonic water."
- "Garnish with dried rose petals and a twist of grapefruit peel clinging to the rim."
- "Serve immediately. Enjoy fizzy, floral notes mingling with sharp citrus and warming spice."
introduction: "Rosé with gin. Grapefruit juice punch. Honey brings sweetness instead of rose syrup, a different floral vibe. Star anise swaps the cardamom warmth for licorice spice. Aquafaba—vegan foam instead of egg white. Twice as much grapefruit juice for a sharper citrus bite. Tonic split, scattered petals on top, a few snaps of zest for aroma. Shake, strain, pour. Chill glasses to keep fizz alive. Rounded but complex. Bright warm cold mix. Rose petals drift. Short and punchy. The unexpected twist. Just two glasses, two servings."
ingredientsNote: "Honey syrup tones down floral too much? Use agave nectar. Aquafaba foams but less firm than egg white; shake longer for proper froth. Pink rosé is still key but lower amount lets gin and grapefruit shine. Star anise pods add subtle aroma; crush lightly to avoid overpowering. Orange blossom water replaces rose water for a softer flower note. Ice slightly crushed or cubed—choose your texture. Keep tonic cold and pour last to maintain sparkle. Dried rose petals must be edible, no perfume. Zest should preferably be thick pieces for grip and scent."
instructionsNote: "Chill the wine glasses beforehand for crisp serving. Pour tonic gently to avoid losing carbonation. When shaking, the aquafaba needs vigorous action to foam well—about 25 seconds minimum. Strain through a fine sieve to catch star anise bits and ice shards. Layer tonic first, then gently pour cocktail to preserve bubbles. Garnish artfully: petals floating or clinging, zest twisted and hooked on rim. Serve quick, cold, fizzy. Watch for foam settling—drink within minutes for best mouthfeel. No muddling, no stirring; all shaking and straining. Slight variations in times and shaking force adjust texture and taste."
tips:
- "Chill those glasses ahead. Cold keeps fizz alive. Pour tonic carefully. Avoid losing carbonation. Layer drinks carefully. Tonic goes first."
- "Use aquafaba right. Shake it well. About 25 seconds. Longer if needed for fluff. Strain through fine mesh. Catch ice shards."
- "Consider honey syrup. Is it too sweet? Agave nectar could work too. Star anise pods are delicate; don't crush hard. Balance flavors."
- "Garnish artfully. Dried petals float or cling. Zest must be thick pieces; these add aroma. Don't muddle or stir; all about shaking."
- "Use good quality gin. It matters for flavor. Pink rosé wine should enhance, not overpower. Adjust proportions to taste. Keep it balanced."
faq:
- "q: What's the best way to store leftover cocktail? a: Pour into sealed container. Keep in fridge; can stay few days. But sparkles fade fast. Drink fresh."
- "q: Can I use fresh grapefruit juice? a: Yes, fresh adds layer. Just make sure it's not too tart. Balance with honey. Keep sweetness right. Tonic works too."
- "q: Any tips for a foamier drink? a: Shake really hard; don't hold back. Longer shaking gives better foam. Use cold aquafaba for the best texture."
- "q: How to alternate ingredients? a: You can swap ingredients; add personal twist. Use different spirits, add herbs. Play around; find what you like."
