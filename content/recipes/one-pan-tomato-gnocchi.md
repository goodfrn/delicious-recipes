slug: "one-pan-tomato-gnocchi"
description: "Quick skillet gnocchi simmered in a fresh tomato sauce with garlic and herbs. The bocconcini melts into creamy pockets creating contrasting textures. Uses less oil and adds a pinch of chili flakes for subtle heat. Onion sweated gently with water to soften without browning, preserving delicate flavors. Basil stems infuse sauce; leaves finish dish for brightness. Cook gnocchi directly in sauce to absorb flavor and thicken sauce naturally. Simple substitutions possible for fresh cheese and herbs, keeping dish flexible. Timing relies on visual cues and aromatic cues rather than strict minutes. Rustic, fuss-free, rewarding comfort food."

ingredients:
- "1 medium onion finely minced"
- "20 ml olive oil"
- "40 ml water"
- "3 cloves garlic minced"
- "700 ml crushed tomatoes or canned diced tomatoes blended"
- "1 basil stem with leaves reserved"
- "2 packs 300 g fresh gnocchi each"
- "150 g burrata or small fresh mozzarella, torn"
- "Red chili flakes pinch optional"
- "Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper"
- "Shaved pecorino or asiago cheese optional"
instructions:
- "Heat olive oil in wide non-stick skillet over medium heat. Toss in minced onion. Stir constantly, sweat without coloring about 6 minutes. Add water to loosen mixture, cook 4 minutes more. Onion should be translucent and soft, not brown – no bitterness allowed."
- "Stir in garlic and optional chili flakes. Cook 1 minute, smell aroma change—fresh pungent garlic, no burnt bits."
- "Add crushed tomatoes and basil stem. Bring to gentle simmer. Cover partially with splatter guard or lid tilted. Reduce heat to medium-low, simmer sauce 18-20 minutes until slightly thickened and glossy, stirring occasionally. Watch for bubbles – slow consistent simmer, minimal skin forming on top."
- "Season with salt and pepper last minute. Adjust acidity with pinch sugar if tomatoes too sharp."
- "Nestle fresh gnocchi into sauce in a single layer. Cover. Cook 3-4 minutes without stirring until gnocchi start puffing and floating. Flip gently with spatula, scatter torn burrata on top. Cover again. Cook 3 more minutes until gnocchi tender and cheese melts into creamy pockets."
- "Remove basil stem (it’s for flavor, not texture). Check gnocchi firmness by pressing one gently against pan, should give but keep shape. Sauce should coat gnocchi thickly."
- "Serve immediately, scattered with basil leaves and shaved pecorino if available. Spoon sauce generously. Best eaten right away."
- "Substitution tip: If no fresh gnocchi, use frozen thawed thoroughly or soft cooked small pasta. Burrata replaced by creamy ricotta or soft goat cheese—different texture but still luscious."
- "If sauce thickens too much, loosen with a splash of pasta water or broth reserved from cooking gnocchi separately."
- "Avoid high heat during simmer to prevent acid bitterness and burnt garlic flavor."
introduction: "Sweat onion gently in olive oil and just a dash of water. No rush or the flavor sears bitter in seconds. Garlic added after softness, releasing punch but never blackened. Tip: simmering crushed tomatoes slowly lets flavors deepen — use those stems on your basil; they’re flavor gold. Toss gnocchi in sauce instead of boiling separately. They steam their starch and soak sauce simultaneously. Bocconcini melts in irregular pockets, creamy softness cuts that yeasty gnocchi chew. Heat just right — low enough to avoid breaking cheese, high enough for sauce to bubble. Unexpected pinch of chili sneakily pokes flavor awake. Shave pecorino atop for salty snap or use asiago if you like sharper edge. Serve hot or risk cheese firming and gnocchi stiffening. You don’t want that. Timing is sensory: smell, sight, subtle texture changes. No countdowns here. Cooking is not a stopwatch. It’s feel, smell, touch. Learn those signals and you’ve got it."
ingredientsNote: "Onion should be minced finely for quick and even softening without overcooking. Adding water in early sweating phase is a classic technique to draw out moisture and avoid caramelization until base is tender. Garlic crushes stronger flavor — best added late to prevent bitterness. Crushed tomatoes work beautifully here; canned diced blended smooth if needed save a step but crushed preferred for texture. Basil stems give woody herbal essence deeper than leaves alone. Fresh gnocchi dissolves in sauce; frozen can work if thawed completely but firmer varieties need careful timing. Bocconcini adds creaminess but burrata or even fresh mozzarella works for stretchy melted effect. Chili flakes optional but adds dimension — subtle heat can lift a tomato sauce. Cheeses to shave on top offer varied complexity; pecorino sharp and salty, asiago buttery with bite. Swapping basil for oregano is possible but changes the dish character."
instructionsNote: "Slow sweated onion forms flavor backbone, don’t rush. Use moderate heat, stir often to prevent browning. Adding water here extracts moisture and softens without breaking down cells aggressively. Garlic is delicate; add late to avoid burning—smell is key signal. Simmer sauce covered partially keeps moisture in, slow thickening yields well-integrated flavor, watch skin forming on sauce but don’t stir constantly — let it breathe. Toss gnocchi in sauce for final cooking. They release starch thickening sauce, no need for extra flour or thickeners. Turning gnocchi ensures even cooking, watch for puff and gentle floating. Melt cheese last to prevent rubbery texture, cover helps hold heat to melt but keep shape. Remove basil stems before serving or they add stringiness. Taste and adjust salt last because cooking concentrates flavors. Keep dish warm but not reheated repeatedly or gnocchi stiffen and cheese hardens."
tips:
- "Slow sweat onions in oil. No rush on heat. Low and steady. Adding water draws moisture out. Prevents burning. Aromas signal readiness. Garlic goes in last to avoid bitter. "
- "For sauce depth, simmer tomatoes slowly, let flavors emerge. Use basil stems; they add earthy undertones. Classic technique, don’t skip it. Gnocchi cooks in sauce, no boiling separate. It absorbs flavors."
- "If gnocchi seem dense, check their cooking. Should be puffed, floating. Flip gently to avoid breaking. Don't stir too much, let them breathe. Timing based on visuals and smell."
- "If too thick, splash in some pasta water or broth. Avoid overcooking—gnocchi and cheese firm up. Check texture often, adjust taste last. Salt enhances flavors, do this just before serving."
- "For substitutions, frozen gnocchi works but thaw first. Use ricotta or goat cheese instead of burrata. Swap basil for oregano but changes flavor profile. Keep an eye on garlic to prevent burning."
faq:
- "q: Can I use frozen gnocchi? a: Yes, thawed completely works. Watch cooking time. Firm varieties may need adjustments. Test with a pinch."
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. Best within couple of days. Reheat gently on low; too hot will harden cheese and gnocchi."
- "q: What if sauce is too acidic? a: Add pinch of sugar. Balances acidity, enhances overall flavor. Also, reduce heat; rapid simmer can intensify acid."
- "q: Gnocchi fell apart during cooking? a: Likely overcooked or too much stirring. Gently flipping or monitoring closely helps. Texture checks matter—avoid losing shape."
