- "Trim fat from pork shoulder. Heat olive oil large pot. Brown pork pieces till golden. Salt pepper liberally. Add onions, carrots, celery, peppercorns, bay leaves, star anise. Pour in chicken stock until meat covered plus 100 ml. Bring to boil. Lower heat, cover partially. Simmer 2 hrs 45 min till fork tender. Remove pork. Strain broth through mesh. Reserve 1.6 liters broth, supplement with stock if less. Discard vegetables."
- "Cut pork into large chunks. Chill if needed."
- "=== Meatball Stew ==="
- "Lightly toast 125 ml flour in skillet medium heat till amber. Stir constantly. Sift toasted flour. In bowl, combine sifted flour, remaining raw flour, allspice, ginger. Slowly add cold water, whisk to smooth batter. Adjust water curling"
- "Add batter into broth while whisking vigorously. Bring to simmer whisking to avoid lumps. Season broth with salt and pepper to taste."
- "In separate bowl mix ground pork, breadcrumbs, scallions, egg, cream, smoked paprika, mustard powder. Salt pepper well."
- "Dampen hands lightly with oil. Form meatballs approx 15 ml each. Drop balls into simmering sauce gently. Cover partially. Cook 15 min steady simmer."

introduction: "Chunks pork shoulder simmered slowly in spiced broth. Vegetables and aromatics for deep base â€” onions, celery, carrots, star anise instead of cloves. Pink peppercorns swap black. Flour toasted till caramelized, whisked into broth to thicken. Ground pork with creamy egg, smoky paprika, fresh scallions folded into meatballs. Meatballs gently poached in the sauce, pork chunks added near the end. Broth rich and fragrant. Heat just enough to warm spices, no overpowering cinnamon. Adapted for subtle complexity. Hands-on shaping, slow simmer, patience. No nuts or strong pungency. Winter comfort with a faint eastern whisper."
ingredientsNote: "Shoulder cut preferred for balance fat and lean. Trim fat but maintain some for flavor. Stock amount flexible add as needed to cover meat. Toasting flour key step for nutty flavor, avoid burnt taste. Use unbleached flour for natural tone. Ground allspice and ginger replace original cinnamon and cloves for mild warm aroma. Star anise gives subtle licorice hint, skips clove sharpness. Broth strained well no veggies left, smooth base for sauce. Egg and cream moisten meatballs, breadcrumbs bind gently. Smoked paprika adds mild earthiness, replaces mustard powder partly for depth. Adjust seasoning to personal taste. Oil on hands stops mixture sticking, uniform balls easier. Chilled pork chunks blend flavors better when added mid-cook."
instructionsNote: "Brown pork first to seal juices, a must. Simmering low and slow for nearly 3 hours breaks connective tissue, yields falling apart meat. Skim any foam to keep broth clear. Strain meticulously then measure broth for sauce consistency. Toast flour in batches for even color. Mix flours with spices in bowl, adding cold water slowly avoids lumps. Whisk broth continuously during thickening step prevents clumping. Meatball mix firmly combined but not overworked for tender finish. Simmer balls gently, bubbling only, breaks but holds shape. Add meat chunks last to warm through without drying. Final simmer melds flavors. Salt pepper at multiple steps, careful final tasting. Sauce may be adjusted with extra water or stock. Serve immediately or keep warm gently."
tips:
- "Use pork shoulder has balance of fat and lean. Trim but leave some fat. Adds flavor. Brown meat well for seals. Juices stay inside. Don't rush this step."
- "Toast flour in skillet. This enhances flavor. Medium heat for 5-8 minutes. Stir constantly. Aim for amber color, not dark brown. Important for thickness."
- "Broth strain well. Discard veggie remnants. Smooth sauce crucial. Skimming foam helps too. Clear broth makes a difference in final dish. Measure broth. Adjust as needed."
- "Form meatballs gently. Oil hands to prevent sticking. Aim for uniform size about 15 ml each. Avoid overworking mix. Tender results depend on this. Simmer gently."
- "Last, adjust seasonings often. Salt and pepper throughout cooking. Taste early and adjust late. Spice balance key to final flavor profile. Broth might need more stock."
