ingredients:
- "40 ml avocado oil"
- "35 ml walnut oil"
- "20 ml white wine vinegar"
- "60 g assorted baby greens"
- "10 cherry tomatoes, halved"
- "Freshly ground black pepper"
- "Sea salt"
instructions:
- "In a medium bowl, whisk together avocado oil walnut oil and white wine vinegar until the mixture looks slightly thickened but still fluid. Watch for subtle shine shift that's your signal."
- "Add the mixed baby greens in batches tossing gently after each addition to evenly coat leaves. Avoid over mixing, bruised greens go limp fast."
- "Fold in the halved cherry tomatoes carefully, the skin should resist slightly when stirred, tomato juice threads start to appear."
- "Season with salt and pepper sparingly. Taste frequently. Balancing acidity against oil weight is key."
- "Serve immediately alongside walnut crusted parmesan fondue or your choice of nutty complement. Do not refrigerate leftover dressed greens; they wilt and lose punch."
- "If fresh walnut oil unavailable, substitute up to half with toasted hazelnut oil – different but complementary."
- "Use avocado oil for smooth mouthfeel; sunflower oil tends to overpower and offers less stability at room temp."
introduction: "Quick handiwork on greens but no rush. Oils whisked to slight opacity—sign of proper emulsion. Baby leaves glisten—soft textures hinting at garden freshness. Cherry tomatoes pop gently, cracking skin releasing fruity essence. Salt, pepper layered in, seasoning just enough. Robust walnut notes grounded by creamy avocado oil. Perfect timing crucial to avoid limp salad disaster. Fast toss, gentle fold. Heat from hands detected, warmth loosening oil. Serve soon, snap and crunch retained. Can’t fake freshness here. Replace nuts if allergy—hazelnuts or pecans work, but flavor shifts. Dressing kept separate if needed. Simple but demands respect."
ingredientsNote: "Avocado oil smooths flavors and keeps vinaigrette stable longer than sunflower oil, which can taste harsh raw. Walnut oil brings deep nuttiness but can turn bitter if overheated or left exposed to light, so store it in a dark bottle. Feel free to swap half walnut oil with toasted hazelnut for a rounder flavor profile. White wine vinegar is bright but mild; lemon juice or champagne vinegar can be used if unavailable but adjust quantity to taste since lemon is more aggressive. Mixed baby greens vary: arugula adds pepper, mizuna a mild crunch; know your market, buy freshest available. Cherry tomatoes should be ripe but firm to avoid sogginess."
instructionsNote: "Whisk oils and vinegar first — this ensures emulsification and even flavor coating. If you skip this, patches of oil or vinegar will sit separately dulling taste. Adding greens in batches lets vinaigrette adhere without bruising leaves into mush. Handle tomatoes last and fold carefully to preserve shape and avoid juice overflow. Salt at the end; too early wilts greens. Taste after seasoning— acidity, fat, salt need balance, adjust incrementally. Serve immediately: delicate leaves wilt rapidly once dressed. If prep ahead is necessary, keep dressing separate until the last minute. Any leftover dressing can be stored refrigerated up to a week but shake well before use."
tips:
- "Choosing greens important. Arugula adds spice, soft textures of baby spinach lend creaminess. Freshness key. Rinse gently. Avoid bruising."
- "Vinaigrette whisking crucial. Emulsion signals when it's slightly thick yet pourable. Avoid patchy dressing on greens. Always taste, adjust as needed."
- "Texture balance matters. Gently toss, no swift movements. Broken greens lose appeal. Keep vinaigrette and greens separate until serving."
- "Tomatoes are critical. Opt for ripe but firm cherries. Skin should snap—juicy but not too runny. Handling is delicate. Fold, don’t smash."
- "Storage tips vital. Leftover dressing can last in the fridge a week. But greens? Dress and serve immediately. Wilt fast. Last minute prep ideal."
faq:
- "q: How can I keep greens fresh longer? a: Rinse beforehand, but dry well. Store in a breathable container. Never dress until ready. Cling wrap helps."
- "q: What if I don't have walnut oil? a: Substituting half with hazelnut or use avocado oil solely. Vinaigrette flavor profile shifts, adjust ratios for balance."
- "q: How to avoid soggy tomatoes? a: Use those that are ripe yet firm. Cut just before mixing in. Handle gently to retain shape. Snap when cut."
- "q: Can I dress the salad ahead of time? a: Best to avoid—it wilts greens. If must, keep vinaigrette apart. Add fresh just before serving."
