title: "Rustic Morello Cherry Tart"
slug: "rustic-morello-cherry-tart"
description: "A loosely shaped tart with a flaky buttery crust enveloping juicy tart Morello cherries. Balanced sweetness with some almond notes. Relaxed approach—no strict pan, no perfect edges. The flaky pastry cracks under fork pressure. The cherries bubble, their juices thick and glossy. A hint of almond flour swapped in for some wheat flour adds nutty complexity. Easy to fix if crust soggy: blind bake a bit longer or dust crust with ground nuts before filling. Replace cherries with frozen cranberries or raspberries in off-season. Rustic, unpredictable, but worth it at the table."

ingredients:
- "200g all-purpose flour"
- "70g almond flour"
- "130g cold unsalted butter cut into cubes"
- "50g granulated sugar"
- "5g fine sea salt"
- "1 large egg"
- "450g pitted Morello cherries (fresh or frozen, thawed and drained)"
- "60g coconut sugar"
- "20g cornstarch"
- "15g sliced almonds"
- "Zest of 1 lemon"
- "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
- "1 tablespoon lemon juice"
- "1 egg yolk beaten with 1 tablespoon water for wash"
- "Flaky sea salt for finishing"
instructions:
- "Mix all-purpose and almond flour with sugar and salt evenly in bowl. Add cold butter cubes. Cut butter into flour by pressing repeatedly with fingertips or pastry cutter until pea-size lumps remain. Keep it cold. Stop overworking; patches of butter visible makes flakier crust."
- "Beat egg lightly, fold into the dry ingredients just until dough holds. Dough should be shaggy but coming together. If too dry, add 1 teaspoon cold water at a time. Wrap dough in plastic and chill minimum 40 minutes. Chilling solidifies fats—key for flaky pastries."
- "While dough chills, prepare fruit. Drain cherries well—excess liquid means soggy bottom. Toss cherries with coconut sugar, cornstarch, lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla. Cornstarch thickens juice released during baking; coconut sugar lends subtle caramel note instead of plain sweetness."
- "Preheat oven to 185°C (365°F). Line baking sheet with parchment or silicone mat."
- "On lightly floured surface, roll dough into roughly 30cm circle. Don't fuss about perfect shape; ragged edges are the point—rustique look. Transfer carefully to baking sheet using a wide spatula. Patch tears with bits of dough, no shame."
- "Scatter cherries over dough leaving 5cm border. Sprinkle almonds on top. Fold edges of dough over cherries, crimps forming natural pleats—not tight or neat. Brush dough edges with egg wash lightly; this promotes golden color and crispness."
- "Sprinkle flaky sea salt sparingly on crust edges and fruit for contrast and crunch."
- "Slide tart into oven. Listen for gentle bubbling and smell bright fruity acidity. After 45 to 55 minutes, crust should be golden with darker caramel spots where sugar pooled. Fruit should look jammy and thick. If crust edge browns too fast, loosely tent with foil."
- "Cool on rack. Crust firms further during cooling. Serve warm or room temp. Tart thickens as juices set. Slice with sharp knife—should cut cleanly, not squish."
- "If crust soggy bottom, next time pre-bake crust blind 10 minutes under parchment with beans. Sprinkle 10g almond flour or ground nuts on base before fruit to absorb juice. If cherries not available, frozen thawed raspberries work but expect more juice release; increase cornstarch by 5g."
- "For an amping twist—fold handful of finely chopped dark chocolate into cherries or add splash of orange liquor for aroma complexity."
introduction: "Cherry season, that fleeting window. Grab morellos, or frozen if still craving. Tart shell simple mix of butter, flour, and a bit of sugar—almond flour swapped in for depth. Flaky, tender crust carries bubbling cherry filling. No pan needed—flat sheet or parchment does. Fold edges roughly; rustic look counts. Timing's clue—cherries bubbling thick, crust golden with browned sugar spots. Rim edge won’t brown evenly; edges tender but crisp. Almonds add crunch contrast. Don’t drown the dough under wet fruit—drain cherries before dusting with cornstarch. Serve warm or cooled. Closes to home baking you’ll reach. Easy twist chocolate bits or citrus liquor. Sticking with basics lets subtle steps shine."
ingredientsNote: "Butter cold and cubed freezes the occasional flake while baking, making the crust layered and flaky instead of dense. Almond flour replaces some wheat—nutty aroma and tender crumb. Coconut sugar instead of plain adds toffee whispers in the filling. Cornstarch is a fail-safe against runny juices; more is safer than less here, but too much ruins texture—dots like glue, not rubber. If cherries unavailable, frozen raspberries or cranberries stand in, but increase thickener by 5-10g for their higher juice load. Lemon zest and juice help balance tartness and add brightness. Be cautious about patting dough too thin; around 4-5mm ideal—too thin tears easily. Egg wash and flaky salt on crust edges promotes color, crunch, and flavor contrast. Keep dough chilled at every stage—soft dough equals tough crust. Resting dough 40 minutes minimum lets gluten relax and butter firm up again."
instructionsNote: "Starting with crumbly dough retains texture—the goal is patchy butter lumps apparent in the dough, not fully homogeneous. Work fast; warm hands can melt butter, ruining ﬂakiness. Chilling dough is not optional; skip it and pastry runs flat. Toss fruit with sugar and cornstarch, not before draining—excess juice dilutes thickener and wets dough early. Roll dough roughly, no perfect circle needed; rustic tarts live in imperfection. Fold edges loosely; tight folding squeezes juices out and inhibits crust browning. Egg wash only on dough edges to keep fruit from sticking and to deepen color where high heat hits first. Oven temperature at mid-high is best; too hot burns edges before filling cooks, too low yields soggy bottom. Watch fruit texture and bubbling, not just clock. Cover edges with foil if burning. Cooling on wire rack prevents soggy underside from steam trapped underneath. Use serrated knife for neat slicing. If crust soggy, blind bake next time 10 minutes with weights or sprinkle ground almonds before fruit placement—simple tricks to keep texture crisp."
tips:
- "Make crust flaky. Use cold butter—cut into flour until lumps remain. Keep fingers cool from melting. Toss dough—keep it shaggy, not smooth."
- "Chill dough minimum 40 minutes—fat solidifies. Use plastic wrap. Avoid warm hands. Crust relies on layers for that flakiness."
- "Fruit needs draining. More moisture means sogginess—firm bottom. Toss cherries with cornstarch after draining. Thickens during baking."
- "Adjust baking times based on oven behavior. Check crust color; golden hue indicates readiness. If browning too fast, cover edges loosely with foil."
- "If crust soggy next time, pre-bake—10 minutes with weights. Adding ground nuts under cherries helps absorb extra juices."
faq:
- "q: Why is my tart soggy? a: Avoid excess moisture. Always drain cherries properly. Consider cornstarch more—helps thickening under juices."
- "q: Can I use other fruits? a: Yes. Frozen raspberries or cranberries work. Increase cornstarch. More moisture from these fruits."
- "q: How to store leftover tart? a: Wrapped in plastic in fridge. Best for few days. Warm before serving. Texture stays better."
- "q: What if I don’t have almond flour? a: Substitute regular flour but won’t have nutty aroma. Can try crushed nuts—just adjust for texture."
