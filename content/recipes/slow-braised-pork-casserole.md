- "20 ml salted butter"
- "2 medium carrots diced"
- "1 large shallot chopped"
- "1 celery stalk diced"
- "12 ml all-purpose flour"
- "200 ml dry red wine"
- "400 ml chicken stock unsalted"
- "2 bay leaves"
- "1 small ripe tomato diced"
- "1 smoked Morteau sausage"
- "350 g Toulouse sausages about 3 links"
- "15 ml chopped flat-leaf parsley"
- "10 ml olive oil"
- "5 ml smoked paprika"
instructions:
- "Arrange oven rack mid-level. Heat oven to 175 Celsius. Pat pork dry; season with salt & pepper."
- "In an ovenproof pot, melt butter over medium-high heat. Brown pork evenly, turning often. Set aside on plate."
- "Lower heat to medium. Add carrots, shallot and celery into pot. Cook until onions turn translucent, veggies soften slightly."
- "Sprinkle flour, stir to coat vegetables. Slowly pour in wine while stirring, scraping bottom to lift browned bits."
- "Return pork to pot. Add stock, bay leaves, tomato, smoked paprika. Bring to boil on stove."
- "Cover pot, transfer to oven. Cook 3 hours, turning pork halfway through."
- "Remove pot from oven. Nestle smoked Morteau sausage into liquid. Cover, return to oven 25 minutes."
- "While Morteau cooks, heat olive oil in skillet on medium heat. Brown Toulouse sausages on all sides, about 6 minutes total. Remove from heat."
- "Take pot again. Flip Morteau sausage. Add Toulouse sausages in. Leave uncovered in oven 30 minutes to concentrate sauce."
- "Extract pork onto board. Discard excess fat off meat. Shred pork into chunks with forks."
- "Slice smoked sausage. Return all meats to pot. Toss and coat with juices. Sprinkle parsley thoroughly."
- "Serve rustic style with mashed potatoes or cooked white beans drenched in sauce."
introduction: "Pork shoulder braised slow. Layers of flavor build over time. Smoked Morteau sausage brings woodsy depth; fresh Toulouse links add richness. Carrots, celery, and shallot soften into the sauce; sprinkle of tomato brightens. Flour thickens gently, wine cuts through fattiness. Long stewing breaks down connective tissue, meat pulls apart easily, melting in mouth. Herbs and vegetables simmered in together form thick, hearty broth. No rush. Pot cooks steadily, little hands-on. End with fresh parsley for color, fresh hint. Serve with soft mashed or creamy beans, soak up jus. French country comfort in one pot."
ingredientsNote: "Pork shoulder trimmed of excess fat keeps sauce balanced without greasy heaviness. Butter browns meat and veggies nicely; add olive oil with sausages to prevent sticking and boost crust color. Substituted shallot for onion for slight sweetness; smoked paprika replaced flour slightly to add subtle smoky note. Morteau sausage brings tradition—can swap for other smoked sausage if unavailable, but key to layering smoked aroma. Toulouse sausages are fatty and flavorful; balance quantity downward slightly here to avoid overpowering. Tomato diced fresh, not canned, to keep sauce bright and fresh. Parsley fresh and ample—never skip, adds lift. Red wine dry, fruity, about a cup sufficient to deglaze and flavor broth."
instructionsNote: "Start by heating oven to 175 C, positioning rack center. Brown pork well—don’t rush, this builds flavor base. Saute vegetables next on medium until onions barely translucent; slow softening important to prevent raw bite. Flour dust coats to thicken later, add wine immediately after to avoid lumps; scrape pot well for fond release. Return pork and add liquids plus seasoning. Oven braising at low 175 rather than 180 for gentle cooking, avoid drying. Turn meat halfway to ensure even tenderizing. Add smoked sausage late—too early and it overcooks or melts fat excessively. Brown fresh sausages separately to seal juices before adding to final braise stage uncovered to reduce. Remove excess fat from pork before shredding prevents greasy texture. Toss everything last for uniform sauce coating. Serve with simple sides that soak sauce—don’t dilute richness."
tips:
- "Brown pork properly. Don’t rush this part. Builds the flavor base. Use medium-high heat. Ensure all sides get nice color. This step sets up the whole dish."
- "Vegetables need time. Cook them until translucent on medium heat. Makes a big difference, prevents raw taste. Carrots, celery, shallots all soften nicely."
- "Flour is essential. Coat veggies before adding wine. Scrape up browned bits well. Prevents lumps forming. Integrates flavors throughout the sauce."
- "Keep wine dry and fruity. A cup is great for deglazing. Enhances the broth, cuts through richness. Balance is key in rich recipes."
- "Add sausages later in cooking. If added too early, texture suffers. Brown them separately, seal in juices, then mix in at final cooking to concentrate flavors."
faq:
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Store in airtight containers. Refrigerate for up to three days. Can also freeze, but keep in mind texture may change when reheated."
- "q: What if pork shoulder is too tough? a: Make sure it’s cooked fully. It should fall apart easily. Long cooking times break down tough fibers. Give it time."
- "q: Can I substitute sausage? a: Yes, other smoked sausages work. Just maintain the smoky flavor. Toulouse adds richness but can adjust to taste."
- "q: What sides pair well? a: Mashed potatoes are classic. Cooked white beans also good choice for soaking sauce up. Serve simple and hearty."
