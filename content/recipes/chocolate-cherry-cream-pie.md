description: "A no-bake pie blending softened cream cheese with powdered sugar into a creamy base. Cherry preserves swapped in for pie filling, folded with whipped topping and a quarter cup of mini chocolate chips stirred throughout. Spread thickly into a cocoa cookie crust. Chilled for several hours until firm yet scoopable. Dollops of whipped cream and leftover chips finish it with a cool, sweet pop. A splash of brandied cherries amps the garnish. The sweet tang of cream cheese paired with chocolate and cherries delivers layered textures. Watch for creamy thickness before chilling. Blending rather than overmixing keeps the filling airy. Refrigeration time slightly flexed."

ingredients:
- "8 ounces softened cream cheese"
- "3 quarter cups powdered sugar"
- "1 half cup cherry preserves"
- "1 cup whipped topping chilled"
- "quarter cup mini chocolate chips plus extra for topping"
- "1 prepared chocolate cookie crumb crust"
- "maraschino cherries optional"
- "1 tablespoon brandy optional"
instructions:
- "===Mixing Base==="
- "Whip softened cream cheese and powdered sugar in bowl by hand or mixer until creamy with no lumps. Should smear easily, not stiff or gritty. This is your sweet creamy base."
- "===Folding Filling==="
- "Gently fold cherry preserves into cream cheese mix with spatula. Avoid over stirring. Follow by folding in the chilled whipped topping until marbled but uniform. Lastly, fold in quarter cup mini chips slowly to keep air."
- "===Assembling Pie==="
- "Spoon and spread filling evenly into chocolate cookie crust. A wipe of spatula smooths top without crushing air pockets. Filling should be thick but not stiff."
- "===Chilling and Serving==="
- "Refrigerate at least 3 hours, up to 4 hours. Filling sets firm enough to slice, still supple. Before serving, pipe or dollop whipped topping over surface and scatter remaining mini chips. Maraschino cherries or a few drops of brandy on top add a bright contrast."
- "===Tips/Tricks==="
- "If cream cheese too cold lumps appear—warm slightly or beat longer. Preserve substitutes good but cherry preserves bring texture. Whipped topping can be replaced with freshly whipped cream but be careful not to overfold or deflate."
- "For crust, homemade chocolate cookie crumbs with melted butter preferred but premade is fine. Rest pie time varies; look for filling hold pressure but still yielding slightly."
- "Leftover filling stores covered up to 2 days in fridge; may firm up a bit—bring to room temp for softness."
introduction: "Soft cream cheese beaten light with just under a cup of powdered sugar. The sugar cuts sharpness, adds enough sweetness without cloying. Stir the chewy pop and tang of cherry preserves folded gently, combined but not lost in whipped topping fluff. Chocolate chips—mini for even distribution and small bites—bring bursts of bittersweet. All held in a dark cookie crust, cocoa-rich, crumbly but firm. Chill to set and serve with dollops of more whipped cream and scattered chips. A cherry garnish drapes extra moisture and tart flash. Not overly sweet, keeps texture contrast, and looks showy with minimal fuss. The trick here—softness in cream cheese, fold, don’t whip the whipped topping, and timing the fridge chill. Resting time: more than flavor melds, temperature and texture mingle."
ingredientsNote: "Softened cream cheese is crucial; too cold, lumps; too warm, watery. Powdered sugar fine to avoid grainy textures. You can swap cherry preserves instead of pie filling for more natural fruit chunks and less gelatinous texture. Whipped topping stabilizes better for set, but fresh whipped cream for richer taste—don’t overbeat or fold vigorously to keep air pockets. Mini chocolate chips integrate better than large pieces which sink or shift too much. For crust, chocolate cookie crumbs mixed with melted butter for a firm fast base; store-bought crusts work but check for dryness or crumb softness first. Brandy or a dash of vanilla in filling lifts aroma and depth nicely. Maraschino cherries optional but add a splash of color and flavor contrast. Alternatives for mini chips? Try chopped roasted almonds or white chocolate chips for a twist."
instructionsNote: "Start by beating the cream cheese until creamy, no lumps; use a paddle attachment if available or a sturdy spatula and elbow grease. Add powdered sugar gently to avoid clouding your kitchen. Folding cherry preserves in slow strokes maintains visible patches for tart bursts instead of blending into plain pink. Incorporate chilled whipped topping last; mix until marbled then uniform, do not overmix or it will deflate. Adding mini chocolate chips last is critical; distributing evenly avoids them sinking to bottom during chill. Press filling evenly into crust with a silicone spatula, avoiding smashing that compacts the crumb base. Chill for 3 to 4 hours; look for surface slightly firm but with a gentle give when pressed with finger. Top with extra whipped topping just before serving—pipe or dollop. Scatter remaining chips and maraschino cherries or splash brandy on top for brightness. Store leftovers covered tight to prevent drying out or flavor transfer. Avoid freezing; texture and air bubbles break down."
tips:
- "Cream cheese should be soft enough for no lumps but not too warm. Too cold causes lumps; too warm results in runny filling. Beat until creamy."
- "Cherry preserves add texture. Swapping for pie filling can be too gelatinous, keep fruit chunks intact. Handle them gently when folding into mix."
- "When folding whipped topping, don’t overmix or you’ll lose volume. Gently combines until marbled—not fully incorporated. This keeps it airy."
- "Crust matters: homemade cookie crumbs with melted butter is best. If using store-bought, check if it crumbles or falls apart too easily."
- "Chill for at least 3 hours, maybe 4. Look for the firmness where it holds shape but yielding slightly when pressed. Key timing for texture."
faq:
- "q: What to do about lumps in cream cheese? a: If too cold, lumps appear. Warm slightly for easy mixing. Or beat longer; persistence can help."
- "q: Can I use something else for cherry preserves? a: Alternatives are okay but keep some texture. If it's too smooth, flavor gets lost."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep it covered in the fridge. Up to 2 days is fine. If it firms up, let sit out to soften. No freezing."
- "q: Can I make this recipe with fresh whipped cream? a: Yes; swap for whipped topping but don’t overbeat. Lose air and it'll collapse."
