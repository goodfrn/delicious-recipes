ingredients:
- "245 g butter unsalted softened"
- "35 g all-purpose flour unbleached"
- "300 ml whole milk"
- "2 ml vanilla extract"
- "160 g caster sugar"
- "1 tsp ground cinnamon"
instructions:
- "Melt 45 g butter in a small saucepan over medium heat"
- "Add flour, whisk constantly and cook for about 1.5 minutes"
- "Slowly pour milk while whisking continuously, add vanilla extract"
- "Bring to a boil, keep whisking, simmer gently 2 minutes"
- "Transfer hot mixture to bowl, cover surface tightly with cling film immediately to avoid skin"
- "Let cool until barely warm, about 20 minutes"
- "Add sugar, remaining butter (200 g), and ground cinnamon to cooled mixture"
- "Beat with electric mixer on medium-high heat 6 minutes until mixture thickens and gets creamy"
- "Scrape sides and bottom with spatula once or twice during beating"
- "Use immediately or refrigerate briefly before spreading"
introduction: "Butter, flour, milk. Basic roux cooking. Then sugar. Vanilla extract swapped with a hint of cinnamon for spice. Cooling crucial to stop thickening too soon. Whipping till thick and fluffy, takes longer than usual but adds air. Sugar changed from granulated to caster for smoother dissolve. Butter adjusted down, milk bumped up for balance. No nuts, no eggs, vegetarian safe. Two-layer 8 inch cakes in mind. Spoon into spatula, no lumps. Layer spread. Chill before serving if needed. Almost fudge in texture. Slight spice undertone. Simple but needs patience. Whisking priority over rushing."
ingredientsNote: "Butter softened but not melted avoid greasy texture. Flour measured carefully; too much makes pasty frosting. Milk whole for richness, substitutes might change taste. Vanilla extract used instead of bean seeds for convenience and consistency. Sugar caster finer than granulated aids quick dissolving in cold mix. Cinnamon optional, adds warm depth, replace with nutmeg or cardamom for variation. Quantities lowered about 30% from original, milk increased to soften texture. Adjust spice and extract quantities to taste but keep base unchanged. Chill ingredients mildly before starting to speed cooling but might slow butter reaching creamy state."
instructionsNote: "Melt butter and flour thoroughly before adding milk to avoid lumps, whisking constantly key. Bring to boil then simmer carefully, do not scorch. Cover with plastic wrap pressed on top immediately, no air gaps to prevent crust. Let rest at room temperature till lukewarm, longer cooling gives better whipping. Add sugar, butter, cinnamon all at once for efficient mixing. Beat at medium to medium-high speed for about 6 minutes, scraping bowl helps incorporate all ingredients evenly. Whip too little and frosting is runny; too long can split. Use spatula to check texture—soft peaks but firm hold desired. Store briefly if needed; not for long-term refrigeration without adjustment."
tips:
- "Use softened butter not melted. Keeps texture light. Measure flour accurately. Too much leads to pasty mix. Whole milk is best for richness."
- "Whisk constantly when melting. Prevention of lumps is crucial. Boil gently and simmer carefully. Watch for scorching, adjust heat as needed."
- "Cooling time changes texture. Let sit at room temp till lukewarm. Longer cool aids whipping. Ideal to stop thickening."
- "Add sugar and remaining butter together. Efficient mix this way. Beat on medium for long. Scrape down sides during mixing."
- "Desired texture is crucial. Soft peaks should hold, but don’t over whip. Can split if beaten too long. Use spatula for testing."
faq:
- "q: What if frosting is too runny? a: Add a bit more cooled mixture. Whip longer but watch for splitting. Can try chilling briefly."
- "q: How to store leftover frosting? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. Will keep for days. Re-whip before use. Can be tricky."
- "q: Can I use a different spice? a: Yes, nutmeg or cardamom is fine. Adjust amounts for taste. Switch it up, experiment with flavors."
- "q: Will frosting hold shape? a: Ensure proper whipping time. Too less makes it weak. Too much risk splits. Soft peaks are key."
