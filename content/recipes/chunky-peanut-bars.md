slug: "chunky-peanut-bars"
description: "Dense bars loaded with peanut butter and bits of crunch. Uses a lower oven temp to get chewy edges, a slightly under-set center. Butter swapped half for coconut oil adds subtle tropical aroma. Brown sugar cut slightly to avoid excess sweetness; molasses replaces half for deeper flavor. Flour replaced with oat flour for texture twist. Extra salt added to lift peanut notes. Peanuts swapped for roasted almonds; peanut butter chips replaced with dark chocolate chunks for contrast. Bake longer at 305F but watch for the telltale jiggle in the center; edges firm up first. Sprinkle almonds and choc chips on top for toasty aroma and melty pockets."

ingredients:
- "6 tablespoons melted butter"
- "3 tablespoons coconut oil, melted"
- "1/2 cup creamy peanut butter"
- "1 cup granulated sugar"
- "3/4 cup dark brown sugar"
- "2 large eggs"
- "1 1/4 cups oat flour"
- "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
- "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1/2 cup roasted chopped almonds, plus extra for topping"
- "1/2 cup dark chocolate chunks, plus extra for topping"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 305 degrees Fahrenheit. Lightly grease a 9x13 inch pan with nonstick spray or brush with butter and dust lightly with flour. Protects from sticking, easy release later."
- "In a large bowl combine melted butter, coconut oil, peanut butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar. Stir until gritty texture softens into thick paste. No lumps — swirl with spoon or silicone spatula strong."
- "Crack in eggs one at a time; incorporate until batter looks creamy and uniform. Resting here won't hurt, but no need."
- "Mix in oat flour and salt. Oat flour yields chew and slight nuttiness, absorb moisture differently, so don’t overmix. Stop when flour disappears but batter remains thick, dense."
- "Add vanilla extract, stir gently, aroma blooms here — don’t skip. Fold in almonds and chocolate chunks, saving about a tablespoon of each for the top. Distribute evenly but keep some chips and nuts reserved for surface texture and visual appeal."
- "Scrape batter into prepared pan. Spread evenly using spatula, push gently to edges to avoid air pockets. Batter should fill edges almost to the rim but not overflow."
- "Sprinkle reserved nuts and chocolate chunks generously on top. They toast and melt, adding layers of flavor and crunch."
- "Bake 42-47 minutes. Edges should be firm, browned slightly; center jiggles gently but is not liquid. Tap pan gently, slight bounce signals gooey middle set enough. If center is too wobbly, add 3-5 minutes but check often to avoid drying edges."
- "Remove from oven. Cool completely on wire rack before slicing. Bars firm up and become easier to cut. If cut too early, bars crumble and lose shape."
- "Store leftovers airtight at room temperature for 3 days or freeze up to a month. Reheat slightly for melty, fresh-from-oven feel."
introduction: "Low and slow heat. Cooler than usual for cookie bars but that’s the secret to chewy edges without burning. Coconut oil melts unique notes into the usual butter-peanut mix; brown sugar cut down so bars aren’t cloying but still deep and rich. Oat flour gives a gritty, hearty texture that’s not cakey or sand. Peanuts traded for almonds because if you’re going nuts, might as well get some unexpected crunch and flavor. Ditch peanut butter chips—dark chocolate chunks melt more luxuriously, sharp bitterness cutting sugar’s overload. Look for that center jiggle, not liquid or rock hard; bar edges should brown and firm first. Let cool fully. Patience here = bars holding shape, not crumbling into sad crumbs."
ingredientsNote: "Butter can be half replaced with coconut oil for unique aroma and moisture balance. If no coconut oil, just butter works fine. Use creamy peanut butter to blend into batter uniformly — chunky peanut butter throws off texture. Granulated sugar and brown sugar split control sweetness and moisture; subbing half brown sugar for molasses-rich dark brown sugar adds depth. Oat flour adds chewiness; if unavailable, use all purpose but reduce slightly by one to two tablespoons. Salt is essential to bring out peanut butter’s nuttiness — don’t skip or reduce. Roasted almonds provide crunch and flavor complexity instead of peanuts; raw nuts will give too little crunch and sogginess risk. Chocolate chunks rather than peanut butter chips for melt and bittersweet contrast. Vanilla adds aroma, balance. Nonstick spray or butter/flour combo helps release bars cleanly without breakage."
instructionsNote: "Start by preheating oven to 305F, oil pan well. Mixing fats and sugars first allows sugar to begin dissolving in warm fat, helping with chewy texture. Eggs fold in good after sugar-fat mixture looks uniform — don’t beat eggs separately; avoid aerating batter too much to keep dense chew. Flour should be folded gently to avoid gluten development that toughens bars. Adding salt later ensures flavor control. Folding nuts and chocolate at end prevents chips melting too early. Batter should be thick, yet spreadable — use a spatula to push into edges firmly. Sprinkled nuts/chocolate top toast during baking, contributing crunch, aroma. Bake time flexible; rely on texture — edges golden and firm, center gently trembling when nudged; creates that chewy, fudgy middle and crisp edge contrast. Cooling fully on rack sets bars firmly; cutting too soon ruins shape. Leftovers stay fresh hermetically sealed; reheating brings back fresh-baked warmth. Practical kitchen tip: if yours bake unevenly, rotate pan halfway through."
tips:
- "Check your butter. Melted but not hot — keeps batter consistent. If you skip coconut oil, ensure your butter’s fully melted to avoid spots. Mixing warm fat with sugars equals chew, mix well. Stir until smooth before adding eggs. Watch batter — too much air makes bars rise, then collapse into crumbs."
- "Oat flour can be tricky. If no oat flour on hand, regular all-purpose can work. But reduce it slightly, maybe one or two tablespoons. Sifting helps with texture here. Mixing flour into butter mix should be quick. Overmixing develops gluten, makes them tough. Keep it thick yet blended."
- "Jiggle in the center. It’s key. If it moves but isn’t liquid, it’s ready. Too jiggly? It needs more time in the oven. Watch edges—they brown first. Tap the pan gently to check for a slight bounce. If it’s flat and wobbly, give it another few minutes. No one likes dry edges."
- "Chilling time matters. After taking bars out, let them cool. Patience prevents crumbling. Cut after they’ve fully cooled. Otherwise, they’ll just fall apart into a sad pile. Airtight storage for leftovers crucial. Keeps fresh for days. Microwaving slightly can revive that fresh-baked feel."
- "Consider swapping half the peanut butter. Cashew butter, almond butter work for subtle shifts in flavor. Avoid chunky peanut butter; creamy ensures even blending. Keep salted options in mind. If roasted almonds aren’t on hand, peanuts work, but adjust salt carefully. Helps maintain texture without too much crunch."
faq:
- "q: Why do my bars fall apart after cutting? a: Let bars cool fully before cutting. Cutting early leads to crumbling. Wait. Use a sharp knife for clean slices."
- "q: What if my bars are too gooey? a: Baking time needs adjusting. Tap pan, if wobbly, back in oven. Look for firm edges. Don't overbake; balance is key."
- "q: Can I change the nuts? a: Sure thing. Replace roasted almonds with peanuts or walnuts. Adjust salt if using unsalted varieties. Keeps flavor bold and balance stays."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Airtight container at room temp or fridge works. Each way keeps them fresh. Avoid moisture. For freezing, wrap well. Thaw when ready."
