description: "Cast iron skillet caramelized pineapple upside-down cake using box cake mix plus tweaks. Butter and brown sugar caramelized first, then pineapple plus cherries layered before batter. Slightly lowered oven temp, adjusted times. Swapped canned pineapple rings for fresh pineapple slices, maraschino cherries replaced with dried cherries rehydrated in bourbon. Juice diluted with coconut water. Batter mixed with melted ghee instead of butter for nuttier depth. Bake until golden edges and toothpick clean. Flips out glossy, caramel-coated pineapple topping intact. Store chilled, reheats well. Practical, time-tested caramelization method and heat control tips included."

ingredients:
- "1 stick ghee or unsalted butter divided"
- "2/3 cup packed light brown sugar"
- "1 20-ounce canned fresh pineapple slices drained, juice reserved"
- "1/4 cup dried cherries soaked in 3 tablespoons bourbon"
- "1 15.25-ounce yellow cake mix"
- "3 large eggs"
- "3/4 cup pineapple juice plus coconut water to reach 1 cup total liquid"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 315°F. Heat 1/3 stick ghee in 10.5-inch well-seasoned cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add brown sugar. Stir constantly until butter melts and caramel thickens enough to coat spoon, about 3 minutes. Watch carefully don’t burn. Remove skillet from heat."
- "Drain pineapple slices. Reserve juice. Measure pineapple juice, add coconut water to equal 1 cup liquid. Melt remaining ghee and set aside."
- "In large bowl combine cake mix, eggs, juice mixture, melted ghee. Beat on medium speed 2 minutes till smooth, thick, no lumps. Scrape sides to incorporate evenly."
- "Arrange pineapple slices over caramel in skillet, pushing edges slightly to seal gaps. Distribute bourbon-soaked dried cherries over pineapple evenly."
- "Pour batter gently over fruit. Use offset spatula to spread slightly if needed but don’t disturb fruit arrangement too much."
- "Bake 50 to 55 minutes or until edges deep golden with zie crisp and toothpick near center comes out clean. Midway check for bubbling caramel at sides. If too brown, loosely tent foil. Remove from oven."
- "Cool 7 minutes on wire rack. Thermal contraction will loosen cake from skillet. Cover skillet with heatproof platter. Hold edges firmly, invert quickly but controlled. Tap bottom lightly if cake sticks, it will release with patience."
- "Serve warm or room temp. Spoon any extra caramel over slices. Store chilled in airtight wrap or container. Best within 5 days. Reheat slices wrapped in foil 10 minutes at 325°F to refresh moist crumb and re-melt caramel before serving."
introduction: "Butter heating, sugar melting. That sizzle-hiss as brown sugar and fat combine into amber caramel. Then pineapple sliced fresh over waiting sticky bed. Cherries not the typical maraschino bright, but bourbon-soaked dried ones — deeper flavor, less sickly sweet. Juice mixed with coconut water for subtle tropical undertone and moisture balance. Batter thick yet easily poured, eggs and ghee for richness, yellow cake mix base keeps it quick and reliable. Bake low and slow, watch edges for color and caramel bubbling. Remove gently, flip when warm, not hot — patience prevents crumble collapse. The gleaming pineapple topping is crown jewel. Frosting? No need when caramel is this lush. Store safely cooled and wrapped. This isn’t fancied up but fully thought through, foolproof for cast iron caramel cakes."
ingredientsNote: "Using ghee instead of butter pushes caramel deeper without burning quickly — clarified fat handles heat better. Adjust sugar down slightly from original to prevent burnt bitterness in cast iron’s intense heat zones. Fresh pineapple adds brightness but canned is fine too; reduce water if canned juice less needed. Dried cherries rehydrated in bourbon add dimension beyond standard maraschino; switch them for crystallized ginger chunks or fresh black cherries for different spins. Coconut water added to juice balances acidity and keeps batter tender. Cake mix chosen for convenience but enhance by adding pinch of cinnamon or nutmeg if you like subtle spice warmth. Eggs at room temp ensure better emulsion and volume. Well-seasoned skillet critical, else caramel sticks and scorches. Butter or ghee fully melted and warm before mixing integrates batter smoothly, no grainy lumps."
instructionsNote: "Caramel stage crucial. Melt fat and sugar slowly, stirring keep uniform amber color, no black specs. Remove from heat immediately when syrup coats spoon thickly but pourably. Arrange fruit tightly on caramel before batter pour to form neat top after flip — overlapping gaps can catch batter leading to holes, messy flip. Pour batter gently; too aggressive mixing displaces fruit and thin layers bake unevenly. Oven set slightly lower than usual to allow slow caramel set and prevent edge crisping too soon. Use toothpick plus look for golden edges and visible bubbling caramel at skillet sides as doneness cues. Cooling 7 minutes lets cake structure firm but still warm enough to demold without sticking. Flip confidently with a quick sharp motion — slow or hesitant leads to partial tears. If stuck, don't force; gently tap or warm skillet slightly over low heat again. Store covered refrigerated prevents sugar from crystallizing on surface; reheat wrapped in foil to revive moisture and melting caramel before serving."
tips:
- "Use ghee for better caramelization. Butter burns quicker. Less sugar helps too. Watch for thick amber color. Stir constantly. Don’t let it darken too much."
- "Fresh pineapple preferred. Canned works. Drain well; adjust juice for moisture. Keep gaps small when layering to ensure even bake. Gently arrange cherries over pineapple."
- "Bake low and slow at 315°F. Check halfway for bubbling sides—means caramel is setting. Edges should be deep golden. Use a toothpick for doneness."
- "Cool for 7 minutes before flipping. Cake will loosen with heat contraction. Invert onto a platter confidently. Tap lightly if it sticks. Patience pays off."
- "Store in fridge to keep caramel from hardening. Wrap in foil when reheating. 10 minutes at 325°F revives moisture. Keeps well for about 5 days."
faq:
- "q: What if my cake sticks? a: Tap skillet gently. Warm slightly over low heat if needed. Avoid force; be patient—tap, warm, then flip."
- "q: Can I substitute cherries? a: Yes, use fresh black cherries or crystallized ginger. Just consider moisture levels and how fruit interacts with cake."
- "q: What about leftovers? a: Store wrapped in fridge. No crystallization when covered well. Reheat wrapped in foil to keep moisture. Avoid drying out."
- "q: Is there a quick way to tell doneness? a: Toothpick test near center—clean means done. Look for bubbling caramel at edges too, don’t just rely on time."
