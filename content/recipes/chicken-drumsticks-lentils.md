ingredients:
- "10 chicken drumsticks skin removed"
- "40 ml (approx 2 1/2 tbsp) olive oil"
- "1 medium onion, finely chopped"
- "3 garlic cloves minced"
- "120 ml (1/2 cup) dry vermouth or dry white wine substitute"
- "300 g (2 cups) sweet potato peeled and cubed instead of butternut squash"
- "1 can 400 ml diced tomatoes"
- "200 ml (about 7 fl oz) chicken stock"
- "45 g (approx 1/3 cup) dry red lentils swapped from lentilles du Puy"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) fresh chopped parsley"
- "Salt and black pepper"
instructions:
- "Set oven rack middle position. Preheat oven to 175°C (350°F)."
- "Heat oil in heavy ovenproof pot over medium-high. Pat drumsticks dry, salt and pepper liberally. Brown chicken on all sides until golden-tan crust forms. Remove chicken, set aside."
- "Lower heat to medium. Add onion, sweat gently till translucent and soft but not colored, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, stir one minute until fragrant but no burn."
- "Pour vermouth in pot, scrape browned bits off bottom with wooden spoon. Let liquid bubble, reduce by half—surface pulls back from sides, syrupy consistency. This step unlocks flavour from caramelized meat bits."
- "Add sweet potato cubes, canned tomatoes with juice, chicken stock, red lentils. Stir gently. Nestle browned drumsticks back in, partially submerged. Increase heat till liquid barely bubbles, then cover pot with lid."
- "Transfer to oven. Cook 1 hour 5 minutes. Check meat with tongs or gentle pull: it should loosen effortlessly from bone, lentils softened but not mushy, sweet potato tender but not falling apart."
- "Remove lid last 10 minutes to concentrate sauce if too watery. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. Let rest uncovered 5 minutes after oven."
- "Sprinkle fresh parsley before serving. Serve with crusty bread, rice, or polenta to soak rich juices."
introduction: "Chicken drumsticks simmered slow with lentils and tender sweet potato cubes. A swap of classic butternut squash for sweet potato adds subtle earth-sweet balance. Using red lentils in place of Puy lentils speeds cooking with slight texture change—red lentils break down a bit, giving sauce a thickened silkiness. Dry vermouth shadows the flavor profile; wine’s grape notes replaced with herbal hints. Browning the chicken deeply before adding liquids locks in juices and layers. Oven cooking keeps everything bubbling gently, freeing you up with minimal stirring. Parsley freshens the bold stewed flavors at finish, bringing brightness that cuts richness naturally. Serves four hungry hands with minimal effort but real depth and complexity."
ingredientsNote: "Chicken drumsticks without skin keep dish lighter and avoid excess grease but still yield rich flavor if browned well. Using dry vermouth instead of white wine adds hidden aromatics and is a fine swap when wine isn’t on hand—can skip alcohol completely and just add extra stock though flavor suffers. Sweet potato chosen instead of butternut squash because it's usually easier to find year-round, and yields creamy sweetness when cooked slowly. Red lentils cook down faster than Puy, but beware of overcooking as sauce thickens quickly. Keep lentils separate if you want more bite and add halfway through oven time. Olive oil for searing is standard—don’t skimp here, you want a good fond on the pan to build flavor. Parsley isn’t just garnish; it’s critical to cut through the richness and add freshness before serving."
instructionsNote: "Browning chicken thoroughly is essential. High heat sears the skinless drumsticks, locking moisture and rendering taste. Don’t rush this step; color is flavor. Onion and garlic must cook gently and slowly—avoid scorching garlic to prevent bitterness. Deglazing with vermouth (or wine substitute) pulls up fond, intensifying sauce depth. Watch liquid closely as it reduces; it should coat back of spoon, not evaporate dry. Adding sweet potato and lentils together means they share cooking time; if you want lentils with more texture, add after 30 minutes oven time. Covered oven cooking ensures gentle simmering, no hot spots or scorching. Removing lid briefly concentrates sauce and thickens. Check meat pull with tongs—if it resists, it needs more time; push gently, meat should give with little effort, falling from bone. Season at end since liquids reduce and flavors concentrate. Parsley last; heating destroys color and freshness. Serve hot while sauce is still glossy."
tips:
- "Start with chicken drumsticks skin removed. Reduces grease. Pat them dry. Salt and pepper generously. Lock in flavor while browning. A dark crust is a must. Adds depth."
- "Onions get the slow treatment. Sweat them until translucent, 5 minutes. Stir in garlic just until fragrant. Don’t let it burn. Bitter garlic ruins the dish."
- "When deglazing the pan with vermouth, scrape all those brown bits from bottom. This adds layers. Reduce liquid until syrupy, not dried out. Coating back of spoon is key."
- "Sweet potatoes cook down nicely. If you prefer firmer texture, add lentils halfway through cooking. They can get mushy if cooked too long. Check for tenderness consistently."
- "Adjust seasoning towards the end. Flavors evolve as the dish reduces. More intensity will come through as liquids thicken. Always taste before serving. Fresh parsley is essential."
faq:
- "q: Can I use different vegetables? a: Yes absolutely. Sub zucchini, carrots, or potatoes. Texture changes slightly. Adjust cooking time for denser veggies."
- "q: What if my lentils get mushy? a: Stir occasionally during cooking. Check frequently. If overcooked, they break down fast. Next time, add them later."
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Cool completely before refrigerating. Can be stored in an airtight container up to 3 days. Can freeze but texture may vary."
- "q: Can I skip the alcohol? a: Sure. Substitute more chicken stock instead. Just lose depth of flavor slightly. Don't skip on browning for richness."
