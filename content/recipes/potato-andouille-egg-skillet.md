title: "Potato Andouille Egg Skillet"
slug: "potato-andouille-egg-skillet"
description: "Sautéed potatoes start softening with onions until translucent. Spicy andouille sausage hits the pan, adding smoky fat. Wells made for eggs catch whites and yolks perfectly. Oven finishes cooking eggs gently, cheese melts bubbly under broiler heat. Parsley brightens final plate. Can swap spicy sausage for kielbasa or chorizo. Yukon gold or red potatoes work; russets get gluey if overcooked. Olive oil heats medium-high for golden crust without burning. Watch edges of eggs set, whites opaque but yolks intact. Sharp cheddar adds punch but Monterey Jack or smoked gouda bring variation."

ingredients:
- "2 1/2 cups diced potatoes (Yukon gold preferred, about 1/2 inch cubes)"
- "1 tablespoon olive oil (extra to add if sticking)"
- "1 medium yellow onion, diced"
- "1 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper"
- "6 ounces spicy andouille sausage, sliced or diced"
- "4 large eggs"
- "1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese (sub Monterey Jack or smoked gouda)"
- "2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley"
instructions:
- "Heat oven to 410 degrees Fahrenheit. Get a 10-inch cast iron or ovenproof skillet ready on medium-high heat. Pour olive oil in; it should shimmer but not smoke."
- "Add potatoes. Stir immediately. You want them hot enough for a crisp golden skin but not burned. After about 3 minutes, test a few – softening around edges, but still firm. If sticking, drizzle more oil and reduce heat slightly."
- "Throw in onions, salt, and pepper. Stir every 2 minutes. Onions soften, turn translucent, smell sweet and savory. Potatoes lose some rawness yet resist full softness – aiming for tender but not mushy after cooking."
- "Mix in andouille sausage. Fat renders, aroma hits smoky-spicy notes. Cook for 3 more minutes. Sausage edges brown, potatoes and onion fragments caramelize underneath. Spoon back to clear four indentations evenly spaced."
- "Drop eggs cracked fresh from shell into each well carefully, avoid breaking yolks. Whites start to set immediately. Shift pan off burner."
- "Slide skillet into oven. Use middle rack for even heat. Bake for about 7 minutes. Whites should solidify, yolks jiggle but not runny. Adjust more or less depending on how firm you like eggs."
- "Pull skillet out. Heap cheddar over eggs gently but fully. Switch oven to broil on high. Watch cheese constantly; it bubbles, golden spots appear within 1-2 minutes. Burnt cheese bitter; remove as soon as melted and patchy brown."
- "Scatter parsley over entire skillet – fresh color and slight herbaceous punch."
- "Serve sizzling. Get spatula under eggs and potatoes; combine bites for crunch, cream, fat. Seamless melding of textures and heat from smoky sausage."
- "If no cast iron, use heavy ovenproof skillet with low sides. Avoid thin pans; potatoes cook unevenly or burn. If limited, finish eggs on stove covered with lid at low heat, reduce oven time."
- "Alternate sausage to kielbasa (milder), chorizo (spicier), or vegetarian firm smoked tofu cubes with smoked paprika to imitate. Potatoes can be sweet or fingerling but adjust cooking because softer varieties get pasty fast."
introduction: "Nothing fancy with plating here. Just straightforward heat and timing. Gotta nail soft but crisp potatoes, sweet onions that’ve lost the raw edge, then bring in something smoky like andouille. Eggs cracked straight into the skillet—wells carved out so yolks stay nestled, whites firm up perfectly. Oven helps cook beyond stove-top control. Cheese comes last under the broiler – watch it like a hawk. Makes for a meal that’s tactile and smoky with bright parsley finishing things. Best with a heavy pan that retains heat well, wait for subtle aroma cues before tossing the next ingredient. Quick but makes most out of leftovers and pantry staples."
ingredientsNote: "Potatoes behave differently; Yukon gold’s waxiness keeps pieces intact without crumbling. Avoid russets unless you want soft mush traps around the eggs. Onion choice impacts flavor profile—yellow is classic with sweetness, but white or red can add sharper notes. Olive oil is safest medium-high heat oil but ghee or vegetable oil works if you want a different frying smell and a higher smoke point. Andouille brings spicy, smoky base; if you lack it, kielbasa makes sausage moister and less complex. Cheese’s melting point varies; sharp cheddar is sturdy, Monterey Jack smoother and milder. Fresh parsley added cold after cooking keeps color pop and freshness. No parsley—chives or green onion will do."
instructionsNote: "Medium-high heat on stove crucial. Too hot and potatoes burn outside but stay raw inside; too low and end up soggy. Stir potatoes regularly early on; they begin grabbing oil then release a nutty note when browning. Onions add moisture; watch them turn translucent, never brown here; bitterness will wreck balance. When adding sausage, render fat and concentrate smoky spice. Forming wells is not just aesthetic—ensures cooking eggs evenly without them sliding around. Oven temp slightly increased from typical 400 allows quicker whites set but manageable yolks. Broiler step is a fast bubble, not a grill job—watch cheese constantly, flashes quickly from melted → burnt. Cooling parsley sprinkles before serving awaken palate after richness. If eggs not setting correctly, lower oven temp or bake longer gently."
tips:
- "Potato choice matters. Yukon gold holds shape and texture well. Russets? They can turn gloppy. Aim for nice cubes—about half inch. Brown edges on potatoes—a good sign."
- "Don't overcook those onions. They should turn translucent, sweet, not browned. Adds moisture and flavor. Stir often. Help them soften. Cooking time? Just a few minutes."
- "Andouille brings the heat. No andouille? Substitute kielbasa or chorizo. Maybe try smoked tofu for something vegetarian. Adjust spices as required. Season wisely."
- "Watch that broiler. Cheese bubbles quickly; don’t walk away. Could burn in seconds. This is about spotting changes. Melted, bubbly cheese—yes. Brown patches—perfect."
- "Eggs need attention; you want wagging yolks? Don’t bake too long. Whites should set but yolks jiggle. Adjust timing for preference—7 minutes is usually good."
faq:
- "q: What if potatoes stick? a: More oil helps. Toss gently to coat. Don’t panic. Splash water to steam if necessary—loosen them up."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool first. Refrigerate tightly covered. Can last 3-4 days. Reheat gently; watch eggs not to overcook."
- "q: Why are eggs overcooked? a: High oven temp or too long. Adjust time down or lower temp. Residual heat works; keep an eye."
- "q: Can I use other cheeses? a: Absolutely. Try Monterey Jack or Fontina. Different melt points but good results. Always consider flavor balance."
