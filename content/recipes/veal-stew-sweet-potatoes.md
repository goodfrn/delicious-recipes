slug: "veal-stew-sweet-potatoes"
description: "Braised veal shoulder roast cooked low and slow with root vegetables and an aromatic broth enriched with mustard and white wine. Subtle heat from harissa balances sweet earthiness of sweet potatoes. Techniques focus on layering flavors by searing and deglazing, then slow extracting gelatin from the bone-in meat. Stepwise additions of root vegetables ensure balanced textures. Includes ingredient swaps and tips for working without wine or Worcestershire. Roughly 8 servings, gluten and dairy free, adaptable for egg allergies."

ingredients:
- "1 kg bone-in veal shoulder roast"
- "25 ml olive oil"
- "4 medium potatoes halved"
- "2 large carrots cut in thick pieces"
- "2 large onions quartered"
- "3 cloves garlic minced"
- "25 ml tomato paste"
- "5 ml harissa sauce optional"
- "20 ml Dijon mustard"
- "200 ml dry white wine or chicken broth"
- "20 ml vegan Worcestershire sauce or soy sauce"
- "600 ml low sodium chicken stock"
- "3 medium sweet potatoes peeled and quartered used last 90 minutes"
- "Salt and black pepper freshly ground"
instructions:
- "Heat oil in heavy skillet over medium-high. Pat veal dry. Season well with salt and pepper. Sear meat on all sides until rich brown crust forms, 4-5 min per side. Don’t crowd pan."
- "Transfer veal into slow cooker. Add potatoes and carrots around meat."
- "In same pan, reduce heat to medium. Toss onions in oil left behind, sauté until edges start caramelizing, about 6 minutes. Add garlic, tomato paste, and harissa; stir 1 minute to toast spices and ignite aroma."
- "Mix in mustard. Pour wine and Worcestershire causing scrape-up of browned bits (fond). Bring to near boil; evaporates some alcohol; aroma sharpens."
- "Pour chicken stock in. Season with salt and pepper. Let bubbling promise flavor depth."
- "Transfer all liquids and aromatics to slow cooker. Cover lid tightly."
- "Cook on low for about 7 hours or high for 5 and a half. Veal suuuper tender, falling apart when tested with fork. Don’t rush it."
- "90 minutes before finish, nestle sweet potatoes deep into broth. Keep submerged for gentle cooking, avoiding mushiness but ensuring tenderness."
- "Taste broth; adjust salt, pepper as necessary. Remove veal; shred gently off bone, return to stew or serve alongside."
- "If using high heat, check liquid level halfway, add water or broth if reducing too much."
- "Serve with crusty bread or over grain of choice."
introduction: "Veal shoulder, tough yet rich—benefits hugely from slow moist cooking. Bone-in? It’s a game changer. Collagen melts into silky jelly. Searing must be sharp. Builds depth beyond the braise. White wine lifts acidity; not mandatory. Worcestershire adds umami punch but soy sauce works as backup. Mustard hits a tang that wakes dormant flavors. Harissa? Spice optional but worth the gamble. Sweet potatoes added late to keep shape, contrasting texture and flavor. Timing? Feel the meat’s texture, don’t slavishly stick to numbers. Mijoteuse keeps you honest but senses tell best. The way onion caramelizes hints at readiness—aroma edges on sweetness and savory. Garlic toasted but not burnt. Tomato paste darkens flavor. This is a stew with layers, steam rising, fork sinking to crumble meat, pot simmer whispering hours gone by."
ingredientsNote: "Slow braised veal needs a well-seasoned crust; dryness on meat surface before searing crucial to avoid steaming. Bone-in provides gelatin, enhancing mouthfeel; no bone means adding extra collagen or reduced cooking time. Potatoes and carrots work as root vegetable base, swap any firm root veggie you prefer—parsnips, turnips, or celery root for variety. Sweet potatoes sweeten and change texture; include only if desired. Wine adds brightness but water or broth works in pinch—use acid like lemon juice or vinegar to compensate lost brightness. Harissa optional but steps up heat and complexity; can replace with smoked paprika for mild warming effect. Mustard balances richness—Dijon preferred but yellow mustard or whole grain can fine-tune texture and flavor profiles. Worcestershire adds fermented umami; soy, tamari or coconut aminos substitute if allergy or availability."
instructionsNote: "Searing is foundational; dark crust locks in flavor and initiates Maillard reaction. Avoid overcrowding pan—turn meat carefully to maintain crust. Using the same pan for aromatics saves time and captures flavor residues. Watch onions for color change: golden edges, soft centers signal proper caramelization but don’t brown too fast or they’ll bitter. Garlic addition late avoids burning and overpowering bitterness; stir constantly during this phase. Deglazing with wine lifts fond flavors off pan bottom; don’t skip this or broth will lack depth. Bringing liquid to a boil before slow cooking concentrates flavors—never cold start liquid into slow cooker. Probe meat near bone for doneness—should shred easily without drying. Add sweet potatoes at last 90 minutes, submerged to absorb liquid evenly without turning to mush. End with seasoning adjustment; slow cooking can mute salt so add cautiously. Lower heat and longer cook preferred over short and hot to maintain moisture and tenderness."
tips:
- "Searing's where it starts. Pat veal dry. Don't skip this step. Slice through any moisture. Crust forms better. More flavor. Heavy skillet? Yes."
- "Debone carefully if needed. Meat easier to shred. Cook down flavors in residual fat. Aromatics robbed flavor. Keep that in mind. Use same skillet."
- "Potatoes and carrots base veggies—sturdy stuff. Swap turnips, parsnips for variety. Sweet potatoes? Add them late. Avoid mushiness. Texture contrast."
- "If using wine? Bring to a boil before slow cooking. No watery starts. Focus on flavors. Depth arises. Or replace with broth or acid."
- "Check doneness around the bone. Should shred easily; fork tender. Don't rush it. Liquid level? Midway cook check. Top off if getting low."
faq:
- "q: Want to thicken the stew? a: Cornstarch or flour mix works. Make a slurry first. Slowly add. Stir to combine; watch the thickness rise."
- "q: Can I swap veal? a: Beef works—different flavor though. Chicken could too. Adjust cook times based on protein choice; check texture."
- "q: Meat not tender enough? a: Cook longer. Not too hot—low and slow's key. Ovens vary, monitor closely. Add more liquid if needed."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Fridge up to four days in airtight. Freezer three months—ensure cooled before sealing. Reheat gently."
