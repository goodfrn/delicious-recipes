ingredients:
- "6 slices bacon about 180 g chopped"
- "60 ml (4 tbsp) olive oil"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) stone-ground Dijon mustard"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) apple cider vinegar"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) honey"
- "400 g (14 oz) Brussels sprouts trimmed"
- "3 ml (1/2 tsp) salt"
- "1 medium pear peeled and shredded"
- "170 g (6 oz) crumbled blue cheese"
- "65 g (1/2 cup) raisins chopped"
- "60 g (1/2 cup) toasted walnuts chopped"
instructions:
- "Crisp bacon in a large skillet over medium heat 10 to 12 minutes. Use slotted spoon to remove bacon bits. Lay on paper towel drained. Pour off all but 50 ml fat into a large mixing bowl."
- "Whisk warm bacon fat with olive oil, Dijon mustard, apple cider vinegar, honey, and pepper to taste. Stir till emulsified."
- "Use food processor blade set to slice. Shave Brussels sprouts thinly. Add to bowl with dressing immediately."
- "Sprinkle salt over shaved sprouts and toss gently to soften slightly about 4-5 minutes. Do not overmix or they’ll get soggy."
- "Switch food processor to grater disc. Shred pear finely. Add pear to bowl. Fold in crumbled blue cheese, chopped raisins, walnuts, and reserved bacon."
- "Mix all well to coat evenly. Taste to adjust salt or acidity if needed. Serve right away or chill 10 minutes before plating for flavors to meld."
- "Optional: garnish with extra cheese or nuts for crunch on top."
introduction: "Shredded Brussels sprouts raw, sharp and crisp. Bacon crisped till crackly, fatty splash held back for dressing. Pear added for subtle sweetness, blue cheese brings tang and punch. Raisins swap cranberries, walnuts swap pecans, deeper fall notes, earthier finish. This ain’t your typical Brussels sprout salad. Dressing warmed by bacon fat, whisked with oil, tangy Dijon, vinegar, and a touch of honey for roundness. Toss everything quickly, the salt coaxing mild wilting but keeping crunch. Ready in about half an hour. Serve cold or room temperature. Great as lunch or side. Mix of textures, sweet salty punch, nutty crunch. No fuss, no frills, but no boring salad either."
ingredientsNote: "Bacon is crucial—use thick cut for best texture, crisp but not burnt. Reserving fat is key for that smoky dressing. Dijon mustard sub for classic whole grain mustard, a smoother tang but still textured if you pick stone-ground type. Pear replaces apple for softer juicy sweetness, peeled to avoid bitterness. Blue cheese gives more bite than cheddar, adds moisture and salt. Raisins instead of cranberries—less tart, more mellow sweet. Walnuts instead of pecans for a woodsy crunch. If no food processor, fine knife work on sprouts and pear okay but more work."
instructionsNote: "Cook bacon on medium till just crisp, not brittle, around 10 to12 minutes. Reserve fat carefully, measure about 50 ml to keep balance. Mix dressing quickly with fat warm, oil, mustard, cider vinegar, honey, and pepper. Slice Brussels sprouts finely with slicer disc or sharp knife for quick tenderizing. Toss with salt gently, wait few minutes for slight wilting but not soggy. Shred pear with grater disc if possible for even texture. Incorporate cheese, dried fruit, nuts, and bacon last. Toss lightly but thoroughly. Taste and adjust seasoning—salt or acidity. Serve immediately or briefly chill for better melding. Avoid overmixing—preserve texture and crispness."
tips:
- "Bacon cuts matter. Choose thick cut. Crisp but watch the burn. Ideal for dressing. Reserve fat carefully. About 50 ml is enough. Adds flavor. Don't skip. Dijon mustard adds smoothness. Stone-ground is best. Avoid too much texture in dressing. Pear is juicy, peel to skip bitterness that robs sweetness."
- "Shredding Brussels sprouts? Use food processor if possible. Saves time. Slicing by hand works too. Just takes longer. Don't rush. Add salt to sprouts after shredding. It softens slightly. Wait about 4-5 minutes for balance. Careful with overmixing. Don’t let them go soggy."
- "For the dressing, whisk warm bacon fat quickly with the other liquids. It emulsifies better. You'll want the warm factor. Taste as you go. Adjust seasoning if needed. More honey for sweetness? Extra vinegar for zing? Make it to your liking. Flexibility is key."
- "Blue cheese brings more than flavor. Use it wisely. The more crumble, the better. Adds moisture and saltiness. Raisins instead of cranberries here. Milder taste. Walnuts instead of pecans creates crunch. The earthiness complements the fruits. Change it up as desired for texture."
- "Serve immediately or chill for 10 minutes. Chilling allows flavors to blend. Room temperature works too. Presentation matters. Don’t overthink it. Garnish with extra cheese to make it pop. Maybe some nuts. Makes the crunchy topping work even better."
faq:
- "q: How to store leftover salad? a: Store in airtight container. Fridge is best. Will keep for 2-3 days. Dressing may separate. Just mix before serving again. Crispness may fade, so eat within a few days."
- "q: What can I substitute for blue cheese? a: Goat cheese works if you want tang. Feta is another option. Crumbled or creamy, both add flavor, though milder compared to blue. Adjust seasoning for balance."
- "q: What to do if sprouts are tough? a: Slice them thinner. Makes a difference. For older sprouts, more salt and waiting while tossing helps soften. But fresh sprouts should be fine with light handling."
- "q: Can I use different nuts? a: Absolutely use pecans or almonds. Both give crunch, but flavors will shift. Experiment based on what you have at home. Just keep in mind the taste profile of the salad."
