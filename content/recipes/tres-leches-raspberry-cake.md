ingredients:
- "450 ml (1 3/4 cups) all-purpose flour"
- "60 ml (1/4 cup) almond flour"
- "8 ml (1 1/2 tsp) baking powder"
- "3 ml (1/2 tsp) fine sea salt"
- "5 large eggs (or 3 eggs plus 3 egg yolks for richer crumb)"
- "200 ml (7/8 cup) granulated sugar"
- "10 ml (2 tsp) pure vanilla extract"
- "120 ml (1/2 cup) melted unsalted butter, cooled"
- "=== Milk Soak ==="
- "1 can 300 ml sweetened condensed milk"
- "1 can 350 ml evaporated oat milk (or regular evaporated milk)"
- "100 ml (1/3 cup plus 2 tbsp) heavy cream"
- "=== Topping and Garnish ==="
- "450 ml (1 3/4 cups) cold coconut cream (chilled overnight)"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) powdered sugar or maple syrup"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1 liter fresh raspberries (mixed colors if possible)"
- "3 tbsp toasted coconut flakes (optional)"
instructions:
- "=== Cake Preparation ==="
- "Preheat oven to 175°C (350°F). Set rack center. Butter or spray a 33 x 23 cm (13 x 9 in) pan. Sift together all-purpose flour, almond flour, baking powder, salt. Set aside."
- "Using electric mixer, beat eggs, sugar, and vanilla on high for about 9 minutes until pale, thick, ribbon stage. Longer beating traps air, key for lift. Fold dry ingredients in gently with whisk or spatula, don't overmix or lose volume."
- "Slowly drizzle in melted butter, folding carefully. Butter mustn't be hot or will cook eggs; cool to warm. Pour batter into prepared pan; smooth surface gently with spatula."
- "Bake 30 to 35 minutes. Watch edges for golden color; top should spring back slightly when touched. Insert toothpick in center, clean or with moist crumbs signals readiness. Overbaking dries cake, underbaking creates soggy sponge."
- "Remove from oven. Immediately poke dozens of small holes across surface with skewer or chopstick — this lets soak penetrate deeper. Use patience, don't rush holes."
- "=== Milk Soak ==="
- "Whisk condensed milk, evaporated oat milk, and heavy cream in bowl until homogeneous. Pour slowly and evenly over hot cake starting from center. Let absorb fully before adding next amount. This gradual soaking prevents puddles and oversaturation. Use back of spoon to level milk gently if needed."
- "Allow cake to cool completely at room temperature. No fridge yet; cold soak can toughen crumb prematurely."
- "=== Topping and Garnish ==="
- "Chill coconut cream bowl and beaters ahead. Whip coconut cream, vanilla, and powdered sugar on medium-high until firm peaks form. Coconut cream behaves differently; overwhipping turns grainy and oily, watch closely."
- "Spread whipped cream evenly over cooled cake. Scatter fresh raspberries on top. For added texture and flavor, sprinkle toasted coconut flakes over berries—adds a nutty crunch and visual contrast."
- "Optionally, roast raspberries for 5 minutes at 180°C before topping for more intense aroma and reduced water content. Cool completely before decorating."
- "Refrigerate the cake for 1 to 2 hours before serving to let flavors marry and soak set."
- "Slice carefully with sharp serrated knife. Wipe knife between cuts to maintain clean edges."
- "Serve chilled or at room temperature depending on preference."
introduction: "Trap air in eggs — eggs beaten till ribbon thick. The secret to sponge that drinks milk without falling apart. Triangle of three milks, yes, but here, an oat milk twist slows sweetness, lends that gentle grassy note familiar in northern kitchens. Almond flour addition is subtle; doesn't weigh — just texture, crumb honesty. Butter instead of oil for flavor, not just mouthfeel. Think layers: airy crumb, rich soak, whipped coconut cream settles on top, pillowy and not over sweetened. Raspberries fresh or flame kissed, summer burst or winter reminder. Toasted coconut? Crunch where none expected."
ingredientsNote: "Flour combo upgrades structure; almond flour lightens the often dense tres leches base but watch: too much and cake falls apart. Substitute almond flour with finely ground oat flour but expect textural difference. Eggs: more yolks equals richer crumb, but more whites = better lift. Melted butter must be temperate, never hot; hot fat quick cooks eggs and you lose volume fast. Evaporated oat milk offers subtle plant complexity, but whole milk evaporated works fine. Sweeteners: powdered sugar works better for coconut cream than granulated for less grit. Toast coconut flakes yourself; store-bought can have oils causing spoilage."
instructionsNote: "Air in eggs takes time and patience; don't rush beating. Spot takes 9+ minutes usually. Use room-temp eggs. Folding dry into wet must be slow, gentle; use spatula, coax, no splashy mixing. Butter in drips protects whipped air bubbles; too hot, you scramble. Cake done when golden edges, no wet spots; skewer test no simple; wet crumbs mean needs more time. Holes allow milk soak deep, avoid puddles; too many holes create crumb collapse risk, too few and top stays dry. Milk soak gradual; watery soak yields soggy mess, careful with temperature — warm cake absorbs better. Whipping coconut cream different beast; chill deep for hours, watch sharp peaks; overbeat separates. Roasting raspberries evaporates water; caramelizes sugars for deeper flavor. Rest cake chilled before slicing, knife warm or serrated for clean cuts."
tips:
- "Eggs crucial. Beat them till ribbon stage; air is your friend here. 9 minutes, ensure thick and pale. Room temp — important factor. Cold eggs won’t fluff."
- "Baking temp matters; oven at 175°C works well. Bake until edges golden and springs back. Skewer test, clean or wet crumbs; adjust bake time accordingly."
- "Milk soak trick—whisk ingredients till no lumps. Slow pour on warm cake, start from center. Avoid puddles on top. Let absorb fully. Patience saves sogginess."
- "Chill that coconut cream, deep chill overnight. Whip till firm peaks but don’t overdo it — grainy mess if you go too far. Watch closely."
- "Raspberries? Roast for more flavor. 180°C for 5 minutes. Caramelizes sugars, brings out aroma. Fresh on top after cooling — adds texture. Contrast too."
faq:
- "q: Can I substitute almond flour? a: Yes, use finely ground oat flour. But texture shifts a bit. Less dense. Watch if adding too much."
- "q: How do I know if the cake is done? a: Golden edges, firm top, slight spring back. Skewer check, clean is good. Just moist crumbs mean keep baking."
- "q: What's the best way to store leftovers? a: Keep in fridge, covered. Lasts few days. Can freeze but texture will change. Slice before freezing."
- "q: Can I use regular milk instead of oat milk? a: Yes, but flavor profile shifts. Whole milk works. Adjust sweetness as required; sweetened choices differ."
