ingredients:
- "320 g asparagus trimmed and cut into 1 inch pieces"
- "1 garlic clove finely chopped"
- "25 ml olive oil divided"
- "20 ml mayonnaise"
- "20 ml Dijon mustard"
- "15 ml lemon juice"
- "1 can 400 ml chickpeas rinsed and drained"
- "1 small summer squash diced small"
- "2 blocks halloumi about 150 g each sliced thick"
- "25 g roughly torn fresh mint leaves"
- "Salt and black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Heat half the olive oil over high heat in heavy pan. Add asparagus and garlic. Stir constantly, listen for sizzling. Softening but still with bite means asparagus shines—avoid overcooking; you want some snap. Season with salt, pepper while cooking. Remove from heat once bright green and tender-crisp."
- "In bowl mix mayo, Dijon, lemon juice till smooth emulsified dressing forms. Immediately toss in warm asparagus, chickpeas, diced summer squash. Salt and pepper to balance acidity. Reserve dressing notes; it’s the glue holding flavors. Keep salad room temp, don’t refrigerate or flavors dull."
- "Pat halloumi slices dry with paper towels to prevent sputtering oil. The moisture is enemy number one in pan-frying cheese."
- "Same pan, medium-high heat with remaining oil. Lay cheese slices down. Watch for golden crust forming, about 2 minutes per side. Flip carefully with spatula; cheese should feel firm, color deep amber. Pull off when crust forms but centers still tender–goal is textural contrast."
- "Divide salad into bowls while halloumi still hot. Top each with cheese slices. Scatter fresh mint over all—mint cuts richness, adds bright herbal note."
- "Serve immediately before cheese cools and firms up hard. Salad can sit but cheese loses charm cold."
- "Common Issues: If asparagus is dull or soggy, pan not hot enough. Cheese sticking? Oil temp too low or slices too wet. If mayo dressing is grainy, whisk longer or add splash more lemon for balance."
- "Substitutions: Use fresh green beans chopped small for asparagus. Replace chickpeas with cooked white beans for creamier texture. Swap halloumi for firm tofu pressed and marinated if vegan."
introduction: "Sticky olive oil pops in the pan. Garlic scent stretches air instantly—don’t let it brown to bitter notes. Cut asparagus small, toss hot and fast—keeps snap. Chickpeas sturdy, holding weight, bash them a bit for taste release. Mayo mustard combo brightens with lemon zing—balances richness from halloumi. Cheese sizzles, puffs edges to brown crisp. Mint tears down bitterness with cooling lift. Textures fight for attention—crisp veggies, creamy beans, salty firm cheese. Don’t refrigerate salad or cheese—cold dulls sharpness. Simple summer produce meets salty Mediterranean punch, ready fast enough for lunch or quick dinner fix. No fancy tricks needed, just timing and attention to pan temperature."
ingredientsNote: "Reducing asparagus quantity to just over 300 g focuses flavor and matches chickpea volume better. Using summer squash instead of courgette adds a firmer bite and subtle nuttiness. Mint replaces basil to freshen herb profile with cool aromas complementing warm dressing. Halloumi portion lowered slightly keeps calories balanced while still providing rich salty hit. Garlic finely minced releases aroma without burning. Mayonnaise and Dijon mustard quantities adjusted up marginally for thicker dressing consistency which clings better. Olive oil split evenly for sauté and cheese frying avoids flavor overload. Draining chickpeas well but not drying retains moisture preventing gritty texture in salad."
instructionsNote: "Heat pan till oil is visibly shimmering before adding asparagus—critical, or they steam instead of sear turning mushy. High heat critical here but watch garlic carefully—it browns in seconds. Toss asparagus as soon as it softens around edges—interior should still resist bite. Dressing first—whisk well till emulsified; add veggies while hot so flavors meld but don’t overdress or it turns soggy. Pat dry halloumi completely—moisture causes oil to splatter and cheese won’t brown properly. Lower heat slightly for cheese frying to avoid burning outside while keeping center soft. Flip using firm spatula to prevent slices breaking. Serve salad first; top cheese just before serving so contrast holds. Don’t skip fresh herbs—they lift and brighten every forkful."
tips:
- "Asparagus requires high heat. Wait until oil shimmers. Adds crispy bite. Don't overcook; bright green's crucial. Season as it cooks."
- "Halloumi needs drying. Pat with paper towels. Moisture causes spatters and won't brown nicely. Aim for golden crust without burning."
- "Toss hot veggies with dressing quickly, balances flavors. Emulsified dressing persists better. Avoid soggy salad; keep it warm, no fridge."
- "Cheese flip gently using a firm spatula. Prevents breaking. Aim for deep amber but soft center. Texture contrast is key."
- "If dressing's grainy, add more whisking or lemon juice. Adjust oil temp for frying. Too low means sticking, not browning."
faq:
- "q: How to make asparagus crisp? a: Heat oil well before adding. Bright green means good. Snap is essential. Watch garlic closely."
- "q: What's best for leftovers? a: Store salad base separately. Cheese can harden in fridge. Best enjoyed fresh. Reheat cheese gently."
- "q: Substitutes for beans? a: White beans work, also green beans if you want that crunch. Tofu if vegan, add marinade for flavor."
- "q: Common issues cooking cheese? a: If it sticks, oil temp too low or slices wet. Moisture means no browning. Pat dry first."
