ingredients:
- "500 ml fresh or frozen rhubarb cut into 3/8 inch diagonal slices"
- "200 ml coconut sugar"
- "10 ml fresh lime juice"
- "1 lime thinly sliced"
- "5 thin slices fresh ginger"
instructions:
- "Position oven rack mid-level and preheat oven to 165 C (330 F)."
- "Scatter rhubarb evenly in a 28 x 20 cm baking dish. Sprinkle with coconut sugar covering surface."
- "Pour lime juice over rhubarb gently. Arrange lime slices on top along with ginger slivers."
- "Bake uncovered for 38 to 43 minutes until rhubarb soft but still holds shape."
- "Remove ginger and lime slices carefully. Let cool slightly in the pan."
- "Transfer candied rhubarb to sealed jar. Chill at least 2 hours before serving."
introduction: "Rhubarb sliced thin, sharp lime, warm ginger. Sweet softened stalks after baking with coconut sugar. Not just sugar and lemon, a twist with ginger slices adds depth. The slow heat melts sugar into the rhubarb, melding sweet and tart. Using brownish coconut sugar shifts flavor richer, less straightforward than granulated. Lime juice changes pH, storage safer longer. Bake just long enough so stalks stay intact but tender. Remove the aromatics so they don’t overpower later. Cool slows cooking. Fridge ready, improves melding overnight. Works on toast or stirred into yogurt or oatmeal."
ingredientsNote: "Fresh rhubarb preferred but frozen works too, thaw first to avoid excess water. Coconut sugar adds caramel tones, different from white sugar’s plain sweetness. Fresh lime juice brightens and balances—vs lemon it’s less sour, adding floral top notes. Use thin slices to infuse flavor without masking rhubarb’s. Ginger fresh from root, peeled and very thin to avoid fibrous bits; dried won’t do. Quantities reduced around 30% to intensify flavor concentration and prevent sogginess. No additives or preservatives needed with chilling storage up to 1 week."
instructionsNote: "Preheat oven precisely; too hot ruins texture. Spreading rhubarb evenly ensures uniform cooking and caramelizing. Sprinkle sugar slowly, let it settle on stalks rather than clumping. Gentle lime juice drizzle after sugar to avoid scorching acidity. Place lime and ginger slices last for infusion during baking. Bake uncovered to let moisture evaporate, concentrate flavors. 38 min minimum; check softness by tender poke. Don’t leave aromatics too long—remove when rhubarb just tender to avoid bitterness from overcooked citrus peel or ginger. Cooling in pan slows carryover heat, making sure rhubarb keeps firmness. Store in air-tight to keep fresh. Can be used warm but better cold as spread or topping."
tips:
- "Always use fresh rhubarb if possible. Thaw frozen ones first. Excess water ruins texture. Cutting into 3/8 inch slices helps flavor infusion. Thin slices keep pieces intact during cooking. Using too much ginger takes away from rhubarb taste."
- "Coconut sugar isn’t the same as white sugar. It adds caramel tones to the rhubarb. Adjust measure to maintain sweetness balance. Roast longer for deeper flavor. Watch the time closely. Overbaking can lead to bitterness."
- "Cooling in the fridge for at least two hours is key. It allows flavors to meld beautifully. Keeps for up to a week in the fridge. Store in an airtight container. Ensures freshness, prevents spoilage."
- "Check oven temperature accurately. Too high ruins rhubarb texture, too low adds cooking time. Spread rhubarb evenly for better caramelization. It’s crucial for taste consistency. Pour lime juice gently to avoid overpowering."
- "Remove ginger and lime slices once rhubarb is tender. Too much time leads to bitterness. Use the candied rhubarb as toast topping or mix into yogurt. Versatile use makes it a favorite. Easy to enjoy in various ways."
faq:
- "q: How to make rhubarb less sour? a: Add more coconut sugar for sweetness. Lime balances acidity. Adjust based on taste. Can use honey if not strictly vegan."
- "q: What if I don’t have coconut sugar? a: Use brown sugar as an alternative. Different flavor but works well. Adjust the quantity slightly. Always taste during prep."
- "q: Why is my rhubarb mushy? a: Overbaking is usually the cause. Check consistency with a gentle poke. Bake until just tender to maintain structure."
- "q: How to store leftover candied rhubarb? a: Store in fridge in airtight container. Keeps well for up to a week. Can freeze for longer storage. Thaw before using."
