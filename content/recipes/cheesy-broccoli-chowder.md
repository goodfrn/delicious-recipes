title: "Cheesy Broccoli Chowder"
slug: "cheesy-broccoli-chowder"
description: "Starts with melting butter in a heavy-bottomed pot, then sweating onions gently until translucent and soft. Coat with flour using a whisk to avoid lumps; cook until raw taste is gone and mixture bubbles lightly. Gradually add chicken stock stirring constantly for smoothness; then half and half plus seasoning. Fold in defrosted broccoli, cook low and slow until just tender with some bite left. Blitz partially for texture variation. Melt sharp cheddar last, stirring off heat to prevent graininess. Swap cheddar with gouda or fontina for creamy depth. Use Greek yogurt if out of half and half. Watch carefully for scorch, and adjust seasoning at the end. Serves six with moderate prep and near 40 minutes cook."

ingredients:
- "3 tbsp unsalted butter"
- "1 cup diced yellow onion"
- "3 tbsp all-purpose flour"
- "4 ¾ cups low sodium chicken broth"
- "1 ¼ cup half and half (can substitute Greek yogurt for tang)"
- "1 ½ tsp kosher salt"
- "1 tsp garlic powder"
- "4 cups frozen broccoli florets, thawed"
- "2 ½ cups shredded sharp white cheddar cheese (can swap with gouda)"
instructions:
- "Melt butter in heavy-bottomed pot over medium low heat. Softened onions take 9 to 12 minutes to lose translucence but stay tender. Stir regularly to prevent browning; the goal is drawn-out sweetness, avoid caramelizing."
- "Sprinkle flour evenly over onions; stir quickly with whisk or wooden spoon to coat. Cook roux about 4 minutes until it thickens and no raw flour taste remains. Should smell lightly nutty, watch for color change to pale gold—don’t rush or it burns easily."
- "Slowly add chicken broth in thirds, stirring constantly between additions to keep mixture smooth. The soup base thickens with every pour; avoid lumps by tempering the liquid and maintaining steady stirring. Bring to a gentle simmer; bubbles should be slow and soft, not boiling hard—prevents scorching on bottom."
- "Add half and half, salt, and garlic powder. Stir well to combine. heat still moderate. Watch edges and bottom for any signs of sticking. Adjust salt gradually; you can add pepper later after cheese."
- "Fold in thawed broccoli florets. They need about 11 to 14 minutes cooking on low heat to become tender but keep some texture. Stir occasionally; broccoli should brighten to vibrant green as chlorophyll releases, indicating it’s done. Don’t overcook or it gets mushy and dull."
- "If you want a chunkier soup, leave as is. For a varied mouthfeel, partially puree using an immersion blender. Pulse just enough to break big pieces into smaller bits but don’t fully liquify. This adds body while keeping pleasant veggie chunks."
- "Remove pot from heat. Stir in shredded cheese gradually so it melts evenly without clumping or separating. Sharp cheddar adds tang and creaminess; gouda or fontina work for richer, smoky notes. Stir gently until smooth."
- "Taste and adjust with extra salt and freshly cracked black pepper if needed. Serve hot immediately; leftovers reheat gently on stove—avoid microwave burns and curdling."
introduction: "Butter melting, onions sizzling slowly in a sturdy pot. Patience here pays off. The onion's sweet aroma signals gentleness achieved—soft but not browned. Flour dusted on makes a thickening base that’s not just functional but vital for that creamy mouthfeel. Gradual broth addition crucial; prevents lumps that kill texture and look. Half and half enriches without heaviness; Greek yogurt can save you when dairy’s scarce but watch curdle risk. Broccoli’s frozen but vibrant; thaw fully before adding so heat penetrates evenly and cooks through without sogginess. Partial blending offers contrast—some chunks, some smoothness; texture is king. Sharp cheddar bucks blandness with bite. The pot hums with promise, but threatening scorch whispers never far. Finish with seasoning tweaks to balance flavors perfectly. That’s where kitchen instincts come in."
ingredientsNote: "Butter is essential; substitutes with margarine change texture and flavor but can work. Onions diced uniform size cook evenly—no burnt bits hiding. Flour is the thickener but requires careful cooking; raw taste ruins the soup, so don't shortcut that step. Low-sodium chicken stock controls salt but you can use vegetable broth for vegetarian twist. Half and half adds richness; heavy cream makes it thicker, milk thins it down, Greek yogurt adds tang but stir in off heat to avoid curdling. Frozen broccoli saves time and works well but ensure thawed and drained excess water for best texture. Cheese selection influences final richness—sharp cheddar stands up well, gouda or fontina melt superbly but alter the flavor profile. Keep cheese cold until last; warms too early leads to clumps and greasy soup."
instructionsNote: "Go slow on onions. Medium low heat, stir often, soft but no caramelization. Coat flour thoroughly and cook until it smells nutty and looks pale gold; don’t rush or raw flour hits your taste buds. Add stock gradually; mix vigorously to avoid lumps—a whisk or sturdy spoon works. Maintain a gentle simmer; bubbling too hard scorches bottom, burns flavor. Add half and half and seasoning next, stir evenly. Broccoli needs time to soften but not mush; vibrant green hue means done. Partial immersion blending adds interest—don't overdo it or you lose texture. Add cheese off heat and stir gently until smooth. Season last; cheese adds salt so taste first. Reheat leftovers slowly, stir often to prevent separation. Kitchen tip: if soup is too thick, thin with stock or milk; too thin, simmer gently to reduce. Keeping the pot heavy bottomed saves burner wars and scorching disasters."
tips:
- "Onions soften 9-12 minutes. Keep stirring often; don’t let them caramelize. Aim for translucence. Ruined flavor if browned. Aroma changes—sweet and lighter."
- "Flour needs careful cooking—4 minutes on medium low. Don’t rush; watch for a pale gold hue. Smell nutty. Raw flour ruins the chowder; don't cut corners."
- "Add chicken broth gradually; thirds work well. Stir constantly; it thickens with each addition. Avoid lumps. Gentle simmer, not boiling hard. Scorch risk rises."
- "Broccoli needs time on low. 11-14 minutes cook bright green. Stir for even heat. Overcooked mush—no fun. Texture is key; vibrant chlorophyll signals readiness."
- "Cheese off heat, mix gently. Cold helps melt evenly; avoid grease. Gouda or fontina offer smoky options. Shredded cheddar gives tang and creaminess."
