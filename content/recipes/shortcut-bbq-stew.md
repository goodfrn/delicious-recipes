ingredients:
- "6 cups low sodium chicken stock or broth"
- "3 large Yukon gold potatoes cut in 1 inch chunks"
- "1 medium yellow onion diced"
- "1 cup fresh or frozen green beans trimmed and cut"
- "1 cup diced zucchini"
- "1 can (14 oz) fire-roasted diced tomatoes with juices"
- "2 cups shredded rotisserie chicken meat, bones discarded"
- "1 1/2 cups pulled smoked pork"
- "1/3 cup Sweet Baby Rays Sweet Vidalia Onion BBQ Sauce"
- "3 tbsp apple cider vinegar"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "In a large heavy stockpot over medium heat pour the chicken stock. Add the potatoes, yellow onion, green beans, zucchini, and fire-roasted tomatoes with juices. Stir. Heat until bubbles break the surface; drop to a bare simmer. The broth should just gently move, the potatoes slowly softening without falling apart."
- "While broth simmers, shred chicken from the rotisserie—avoid skin chunks; too much fat dulls flavor. Waste bones or save for stock. Add the chicken and pulled pork to the pot as potatoes start to give slightly under fork pressure, about 20 minutes in. Stir often to distribute meat and avoid anything sticking to bottom."
- "Shake in the BBQ sauce and the apple cider vinegar. Stir well; the vinegar lifts the richness and the sauce sizzles into the broth, thickening slightly. Reduce heat low and cook 5 to 7 more minutes. Look for potatoes tender but still holding shape; broth thick enough to coat spoon lightly. Taste-test salt and pepper last—adjust carefully because BBQ sauce has salt."
- "Remove from heat and let rest briefly off flame. Flavors settle, the stew thickens more. Serve warm straight from pot or ladle into bowls."
- "Optional twist: Just before serving, stir in handful of chopped fresh cilantro or a squeeze of lime for brightness. Alternative protein swaps work—smoked sausage instead of pulled pork, turkey in place of chicken. If you lack rotisserie chicken, poach quick in broth earlier then shred."
introduction: "Chunky vegetables, smoky meat. Potatoes in the pot soaking up flavor, breaking down just enough to thicken broth without mush. Pulled pork and shredded chicken go in late to keep their texture—no rubbery bits here. The base broth bubbles gently, the kitchen fills with the scent of onion and vinegar sharpness mingling with sweet BBQ sauce. You’ll hear soft bubbling, the potatoes sending little puffs of steam. This isn’t about fuss. It’s simmer, taste, adjust. The key is knowing when the potatoes give under a fingernail and the smell tells you it’s time to turn off the heat. A twist of fresh herbs at the end or a splash of lime wakes stale stew. Substitutions keep it flexible on busy nights and changing pantry stock."
ingredientsNote: "Potatoes—the right kind matter. Yukon golds hold shape and add buttery mouthfeel. Russets break down too much. Frozen green beans swap well for lima beans for a bit more snap and less starchy. Zucchini replaces corn here for lighter texture and subtle sweetness without bulk. Fire-roasted tomatoes provide smoky undertone; if you don’t have them, plain diced tomatoes are fine but omit extra smoky proteins or swap sausage for pork. Low sodium broth gives control on salt—always taste before seasoning. Vinegar brings brightness that cuts richness; don’t skip. BBQ sauce adds sugar and acid too, balance salt carefully to avoid a flat stew. If you prefer less thick sauce, reduce quantity or increase broth."
instructionsNote: "Start with the stock as the foundation—it’s what everything simmers and absorbs. Medium heat for bringing up to simmer is crucial to avoid cloudy or greasy broth. Stirring early stops veggies from clumping or sticking, some pots scorch easy if you forget. Shredding the chicken well avoids big chunks losing heat or breaking stew texture. Pork goes in with chicken, timing it so meat firms up in broth but doesn’t dry out by overdoing heat. Add sauce and vinegar late to keep vinegar sharp and BBQ sauce’s sugars from burning. Keep heat low after adding sauce—gentle bubbles, not rolling boil. Let stew rest a few minutes off heat before serving. This step thickens broth naturally and lets flavors meld without cooking more. If potatoes aren’t tender after nominal time, keep simmering but check every 3-4 minutes. Food cooks in stages, watch potato softness for doneness, not clock. A final taste will confirm salt and pepper balance. Don’t rush seasoning. The trick? Keep stirring; you’ll feel the thickness change and smell the onions deepen when it’s right."
tips:
- "Use Yukon gold if you want texture. Russets break down. Potatoes add a creamy feel—watch doneness carefully. Simmer till fork just presses in."
- "Swap green beans for lima beans if you prefer crispness. Frozen green beans work great here. Zucchini gives lighter bite. No corn needed."
- "Chicken skin off—too fatty, dulls taste. Shred and add to pot when potatoes soften. Pork in at right time adds depth without becoming dry."
- "BBQ sauce goes in later. Vinegar too, last minute. Don't let sugars burn, adjust heat—gentle bubbles make all the difference."
- "Resting stew off the heat helps flavors settle. Thickness builds without overcooking. Stir, smell, taste. That’ how you know it's right."
faq:
- "q: Can I use different meats? a: Yes, smoked sausage works instead of pulled pork. Turkey also fine for chicken. Swaps keep it fresh."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool quickly, store in airtight container. Fridge for 3-4 days, freezer for up to 2 months. Thaw before reheating."
- "q: What if potatoes are hard? a: Keep simmering, check every few minutes. Cooking need patience. Stir, notice the change, softness signals doneness."
- "q: Can I reduce thickness of broth? a: Add more broth if too thick. Also reduce BBQ sauce quantity. Just adjust flavor evenly—test as you go."
