- "Chipotle hot sauce, to taste"
- "75 g frozen peas thawed"
- "50 g Tex-Mex shredded cheese"
- "3 scallions sliced plus more for topping"
- "10 small wheat tortillas, 15 cm diameter"
- "30 ml vegetable oil"
- "Sour cream for garnish"
- "Store-bought or homemade salsa"
- "2 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro"
instructions:
- "Mix black beans, cream cheese, lime juice, smoked paprika, chipotle hot sauce in large bowl."
- "Slightly mash half the beans with a potato masher until partially pureed."
- "Add peas, shredded cheese, scallions, chopped cilantro. Stir well to combine."
- "Lay out a few tortillas at once. Spoon roughly 45 ml bean mix across lower center of each."
- "Fold sides over filling, roll up tight. Turn seam side down to seal."
- "Heat vegetable oil over medium heat in large nonstick skillet."
- "Cook half the taquitos seam side down until golden and crisp, about 3-4 minutes per side."
- "Drain on paper towels. Add more oil if needed and cook rest similarly."
- "Plate taquitos. Dollop sour cream and sprinkle extra scallions on top."
- "Serve with salsa, rice or salad if desired."
introduction: "Black beans smashed half—not too much. Cream cheese, lime juice for tang. Smoked paprika replaces cumin. Chipotle hot sauce, smoky heat—not just any sauce. Green peas instead of corn, little surprise. Cilantro stirred in, fresh bite. Tortillas rolled tight, pan-fried crisp. Hot oil sizzles, crisp shell with juicy filling inside. Sour cream cools heat. Extra scallions add crunch. Salsa, bright and acidic, on the side. Cook quicker or slower by a few minutes depending on heat. Serves four hungry mouths. Rustic, simple. Good with rice or salad. No bells or whistles, just straightforward flavor bombs."
ingredientsNote: "Substituting smoked paprika for cumin adds subtle smoky depth without overpowering bean flavor. Chipotle hot sauce ups the heat and adds complexity vs original hot sauce. Frozen peas replace corn for unexpected texture and fresher color. Cilantro included for brightness and aromatic punch. Softened cream cheese helps bind filling. Use fresh scallions for crunch and mild sharpness. Flour tortillas preferred for pliability rolling. Measure oil to get just enough crispness with less grease splash. Use same quantity but shift times slightly to ensure even cooking."
instructionsNote: "Start mixing beans and cheese with acidic lime juice and smoky spice first—helps combine flavors better. Partial mashing retains texture in filling. Fold and roll tortillas tightly or filling spills out when cooking. Seal well, then cook seam side down first to hold shape. Moderate medium heat prevents burning outside, gives golden crispness. Adjust oil volumes to avoid soggy or dry edges. Paper towel drying after frying keeps bites less greasy. Garnish hot taquitos immediately with sour cream and scallions—temperature contrast tastes great. Salsa on side, not inside; keeps them crisp. Serve as finger food or plated with extra sides."
tips:
- "Mashing half the beans is key. Don't overdo it. Retain texture in filling. It adds character. Mix cream cheese right away. Lime juice gives tang."
- "Be generous with chipotle hot sauce. Adjust heat to preference. Too little, too bland. Spice matters. Peas instead of corn? Yes. Fresh taste as well."
- "Roll tortillas tightly. Filling spills if loose. Keep seam side down while frying. Avoid soggy taquitos. Cook in batches. Crown of oil helps."
- "Heat oil properly before adding taquitos. Medium heat gives that golden crisp. Adjust for even cooking. Less splatter, more perfection."
- "Use paper towels to drain. Reduces greasiness. Garnish hot, sour cream cools heat. Add scallions for crunch. Salsa on the side, not in."
faq:
- "q: Can I add meat? a: Sure. Ground meat works well. Mix with beans, cream cheese. Keep flavors balanced. Too much meat can overpower."
- "q: What sides work with this? a: Rice or salad pairs nicely. Keep it light. Also chips with salsa on the side. Brings crunch. Flavor contrasts."
- "q: What's the best way to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. For up to three days. Reheat in skillet for better texture."
- "q: Can I bake instead? a: Baking is an option. Brush with oil. Bake at 200°C for 15-20 minutes. They won’t be as crispy though. But still tasty."
