ingredients:
- "300 g (10 oz) spaghettis"
- "180 ml (3/4 cup) plain Greek yogurt 5%"
- "100 ml (1/2 cup) tightly packed fresh basil leaves"
- "2 shallots, finely chopped"
- "3 cloves garlic, minced"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) extra virgin olive oil"
- "450 ml (1 3/4 cups) fresh or frozen peas"
- "120 ml (1/2 cup) grated pecorino romano"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) toasted pine nuts"
- "Fresh basil leaves for garnish"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Pulse yogurt and basil together in blender or food processor until thick and smooth. Chill while other prep happens. Avoid overblending which turns sauce too runny. Keep it dense enough to coat pasta."
- "Bring large pot of salted water to boil. Salt like sea water - key step for pasta to absorb flavor. Add spaghettis, cook until just tender but still firm to bite, al dente. Taste early, texture changes fast. Reserve about 125 ml (1/2 cup) pasta water before draining. Don’t rinse pasta - starch adds to sauce’s body."
- "In same pot, warm olive oil over medium heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add shallots and cook gently stirring, 5-6 minutes. Patience here builds sweetness, soft translucence but no browning. Add garlic last, cook 1-2 minutes until aromas bloom, careful not to burn."
- "Stir in peas, toss constantly over medium heat. Fresh peas pop, releasing green aroma; frozen soften quickly. Cook until pea skins just tender, 3-4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper sparingly to let natural sweetness shine."
- "Return drained pasta to pot. Lower heat to gentle. Add yogurt-basil mix and half the grated pecorino. Using tongs, fold everything together slowly to avoid breaking strands. If sauce feels too thick, add reserved pasta water a few tablespoons at a time to loosen. Should cling but not pool."
- "Finish with pine nuts for crunchy contrast, remaining pecorino stirred in last second for punchy salty notes. Taste and adjust seasoning. Plate by twirling a generous forkful into tall nests. Garnish with basil leaves and extra toasted pine nuts scattered."
- "Serve immediately. Leftovers reheat gently adding splash of water to regain creaminess. Pecorino’s sharpness intensifies, yogurt mellows with warmth."
introduction: "Imagine bright green peas pop against long al dente strands. No gloss of butter but creamy yogurt and fresh basil whipped smooth. Shallots sweat slowly, cloves of garlic just fragrant, no scorch, no bitterness. Pecorino replaces parmigiano with bite, pine nuts sprinkled last for crunch. Pasta water thickens sauce, binding flavors. A light twirl on the fork, basil leaves fresh and aromatic on top. It’s restraint meets freshness. No heavy cream, no cheese overload, just technique and timing. Swap peas if you like asparagus tips or shelled edamame and taste the difference. The secret: patience on onions, minimal stirring on pasta, controlled heat to coax out aromas without rushing."
ingredientsNote: "Reduce yogourt fat content for lighter feel. Greek style works but normal plain yogourt is fine if strained. Pecorino romano adds sharper punch compared to parmigiano, but shaved parmesan can substitute if needed. Pine nuts toast quickly – watch closely, burn fast; walnuts or hazelnuts okay alternative but change aroma. Basil quantity flexible, more for punch or less to keep mellow. Frozen peas fine if thawed first and patted dry; excess water dilutes sauce. Onion swap from yellow to shallot for sweetness and subtlety; yellow or red onion work but stronger flavor changes profile. Garlic measured, don't overdo or it dominates. Olive oil quality makes difference – fruity, peppery notes lift dish. Salt cautiously adjusted; pasta water salting remains key step for overall seasoning."
instructionsNote: "Yogurt and basil need short whirl, not overprocessed or sauce becomes thin, watery, loses creaminess. Timing pasta precise – taste early every minute after 7 min. Reserve water carefully; starch content varies with pasta brand, adjust amount added to sauce based on texture. Onion soft sweat done gently; fast heat burns sugars, bitter tastes born. Garlic last addition; residual heat finishes cooking without risk of biting burnt garlic. Peas should be tender but intact. Stirring pasta when adding yogurt sauce done gently to maintain texture and avoid mush. Incorporate cheese off heat or very low to prevent curdling yogurt. Adjust seasoning after combining all components; final taste test crucial to balance salt, cheese, acidity. Twirling pasta tightly for plating keeps sauce concentrated on strands rather than pooling on plate. Reheat leftovers very gently, stir with water to bring back creaminess without clumping."
tips:
- "Keep yogurt cold before mixing. Less chance of splitting. Whip basil in quickly but don't overblend. It should hold dense consistency. Go for thick."
- "Pasta water is your friend. Reserve before draining. Starch helps sauce stick. Too runny later? Add just a splash in, mix in increments. Control texture."
- "Shallots sweeten slowly. Low heat is key. Stir gently. You want translucence; no browning yet. Garlic in last. Quick bloom of flavor; don’t let it burn."
- "For peas, fresh is best but frozen works. Thaw and dry off excess moisture. Avoid diluted sauce. Flavors should stand out, no excess water."
- "Pecorino romano sharper than parmigiano. Great for twist. Shave on last second to keep bite. Swap to parmesan if need but aroma changes."
faq:
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate tightly. Put in container. Add splash water when reheating. Keep creamy; prevent clumps forming."
- "q: Can I use other veggies? a: Yes. Swap peas for asparagus. Edamame brings a twist too. Adjust timing; cook till tender. Watch texture."
- "q: Sauce too thick? a: Add reserved pasta water. Go slow. Mix till desired cling without pooling. Balance is key; adjust as needed."
- "q: What if garlic burns? a: It happens. Quickly remove pan from heat. Start over with fresh garlic. Control heat; don’t rush the aromatics."
