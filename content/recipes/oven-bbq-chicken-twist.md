- "25 ml softened butter"
- "12 ml smoked paprika"
- "10 ml ground cumin"
- "5 ml maple syrup"
- "3 ml garlic powder"
- "3 ml onion powder"
- "3 ml black pepper"
- "1 ml celery salt"
instructions:
- "Salt the entire chicken surface, focus on thighs and breasts."
- "Wrap and refrigerate uncovered at least 48 hours."
- "Heat oven to 180 C (350 F), rack centered."
- "Blend hot sauce and butter until smooth."
- "Loosen skin off breasts and thighs. Spread the butter-hot sauce mix under skin evenly."
- "Mix smoked paprika, cumin, maple syrup, garlic and onion powders, black pepper, celery salt."
- "Pat seasoning over and under skin. Place chicken in roasting pan."
- "Cook 1 hour 20 minutes or until thigh temp 80 C (176 F), half way baste with pan juices."
- "Rest chicken loosely covered 10 minutes."
- "Carve and serve with roasted parsnips and smoky chipotle dipping sauce."
introduction: "Salt sits on the chicken skin. Slowly pulls moisture out. Wait two days. Not a quick soak. Butter with heat replaces ketchup. Smooth, spicy. Under skin. Not just on top. Smoke in the paprika and cumin. Maple in place of brown sugar, deeper notes. Oven set low, longer bake. Juices baste, keeps chicken juicy. Parsnips roasted not potatoes. Different crunch. Sidekick sauce smoky chipotle, more fire. Layers, bites with punch. Not ordinary barbecue chicken. Moves with twists and turns."
ingredientsNote: "Use a whole chicken of good size, around one and a half kilos. Salt quantity reduced slightly for milder brining, enough to penetrate but not dry. Replace ketchup with hot sauce for tang and heat, butter keeps texture creamy under skin. Brown sugar swapped with maple syrup for complex sweetness. Paprika replaced with smoked paprika, brings earthiness. Add cumin for warmth. Spice powders adjusted to enhance smoky notes. Keep celery salt, garlic and onion powder for base flavor. Butter and sauce softened well for smooth application. Hold chicken refrigerated uncovered for two days to firm skin, develop flavor."
instructionsNote: "Start by salting chicken completely, concentrating on thighs and breasts so flavors concentrate where meat is thickest. Place chicken uncovered in fridge at least 48 hours, skin tightens and salt works deep. Preheat oven lower than usual to 180 C, slower cooking prevents drying. Mix softened butter with hot sauce, a replacement for ketchup/butter mix, creates spicy rich layer under skin. Carefully lift skin without breaking. Spread mixture beneath skin on breasts and thighs evenly. Then season chicken with combined smoked paprika, cumin, sweet maple syrup, and spices. Pat on skin and under lifted areas. Place chicken breast side up on rack in roasting pan. Roast about 1 hour 20 minutes; use thermometer in thickest thigh without touching bone to check doneness (80 C). Midway through roasting, spoon pan juices over chicken to baste and keep moist. After baking, rest chicken loosely covered for 10 minutes before carving to allow juices to settle. Serve with roasted parsnips instead of potatoes and a smoky chipotle sauce on the side for dipping or drizzling."
tips:
- "Use good quality chicken, 1.5 kg size. Salt applies on whole surface. Focus on thighs, breasts. Salt draws out moisture slowly. 48 hours uncovered is key. Skin tightens, flavor deepens."
- "Hot sauce with softened butter. Must blend smoothly. Under the skin important. Spicy richness inside. Lift skin carefully. Spread evenly, no breaks. An even layer equals great flavor."
- "Lower oven temperature, makes a difference. Cook at 180 C. Slow cooking retains moisture. Baste halfway through. Spoon those juices over chicken. Juices keep chicken juicy, flavorful."
- "Resting chicken after cooking is essential. Let it sit, covered loosely for 10 minutes. Juices redistribute throughout meat. Don't rush carving. Juicy bites vs dry bites."
- "Roast parsnips instead of potatoes. Different texture, great crunch. Enhance flavor with garlic and herbs. Chipotle sauce is a must. Adds fire, complements the chicken."
faq:
- "q: How to make chicken skin crispy? a: Cook at low temp first. Increase heat at end. Broil briefly can help. Skin should not be soggy."
- "q: What if chicken isn't fully cooked? a: Check temp in thigh. 80 C is target. If under, cook more. Cover to prevent drying."
- "q: Can I make this chicken ahead? a: Yes, prep and season chicken. Hold in fridge. Cook day of serving. Keeps flavors fresh."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Store in airtight containers. Refrigerate for up to three days. Reheat in oven for best texture. Microwaving makes it tough."
