ingredients:
- "260 g cooked macaroni (about 1 1/2 cups uncooked)"
- "1 small fennel bulb, thinly sliced"
- "1 leek (white part only), sliced and rinsed well"
- "30 ml duck fat or unsalted butter (2 tbsp)"
- "2 duck legs confit, shredded"
- "200 ml chestnut mushroom stock (or homemade broth)"
- "130 ml whole milk"
- "80 ml shredded aged Gruyère cheese"
- "200 ml shredded mozzarella cheese"
- "Salt and black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 175 °C (350 °F). Place rack in middle."
- "Boil macaroni in salted water until just shy of al dente (slightly firm, bite remains). Drain, toss lightly with olive oil or duck fat to prevent clumping. Spread in a 33 x 23 cm baking dish."
- "Heat duck fat or butter in a skillet over medium-high. Add sliced fennel and leeks. Stir. Sweat until translucent and lightly caramelized edges, about 6 8 minutes. Season with pepper but hold salt; duck confit adds salt."
- "Add shredded duck legs to pan, stir to warm and coat with aromatics. Pour in mushroom stock and milk. Bring to low simmer, sprinkle Gruyère. Stir to melt cheese evenly creating a thick creamy sauce but not too runny. Taste for seasoning adding salt cautiously because broth and confit hold salt too."
- "Pour sauce over macaroni in baking dish. Stir well to combine stirring through thoroughly but gently. Even layer of cheese and sauce coating pasta."
- "Top with mozzarella evenly."
- "Bake uncovered 15 to 20 minutes until sauce bubbles visibly around edges and cheese starts to melt and bubble."
- "Set oven to broil (high grill). Watch carefully broil 2 3 minutes until cheese browns golden with spots of dark caramelization but no burning."
- "Pull out immediately. Let rest 10 minutes; sauce thickens as it cools, flavor deepens."
- "Serve warm. Texture is creamy but macaroni retains bite; crust contrasts soft interior."
introduction: "Duck confit lurking in fridge. Wanted something quick but packs punch. Mac and cheese comfort but bumped up with fennel and leek, giving sweet aromatic layers instead of standard mushrooms. Canned soup swapped for mushroom stock - less salty, fresher. Gruyère and mozzarella combo nods to melty with a bit of an edge. Adjusted quantities to even out richness. Slow roast duck meets fast pasta bake. No need to fuss. You watch and feel — cheese bubbling, edges crisping, duck fat scents the kitchen. Neat textures, no mush. Watch salt carefully; duck confit and broth add. Keep it rustic, familiar but with an unexpected savory brightness. Work with what’s around; use celery or shallots if no leek."
ingredientsNote: "Swapping onion and mushrooms with fennel and leek adds a subtly sweet and aromatic punch, elevating layering flavors, and provides texture contrast. Duck fat or butter works interchangeably but duck fat offers richer umami depth. Replacing canned cream of mushroom with fresh mushroom stock cuts unnecessary salt and industrial taste and thickens naturally when combined with cheese. Gruyère's nutty, slightly salty complexity blends with mozzarella’s stretchiness giving the ideal topping—brown and bubbly but not rubbery. If duck confit absent, use shredded roasted chicken or pork shoulder. Milk can be whole or semi-skimmed; full fat lends silkier sauce. Salt sparingly; base ingredients already seasoned."
instructionsNote: "Boiling pasta just shy of al dente is key because it finishes cooking in oven without drying out. Toss with little fat so noodles don’t stick but avoid soaking in oil; you want sauces to adhere. Sauté fennel and leek till translucent with some browning to pull out sugars; this softens their bite and adds caramel notes without overwhelming. Adding duck confit warm keeps its fat and texture intact—avoid frying to death. Mushroom stock with milk and cheese makes a sauce that clings, doesn’t puddle around macaroni—a crucial texture point. Consider taste testing after sauce assembly to adjust seasoning before baking. Baking temp slightly reduced to protect cheese from toughening. Broiling increases surface crust quickly; watch closely. Resting allows sauce to thicken as it cools, helping to hold together when served. Knees bent, watch, listen to bubbling sounds, see golden edges rippling to know when done."
tips:
- "Cook macaroni just before al dente. Watch closely, test with a taste. Drain, toss lightly with fat to coat. But use just enough; restrict oil so sauces adhere well."
- "Sauté fennel and leeks till translucent and lightly browned. Sweetness develops, keeps the bite soft. Timing here is crucial for texture; don’t rush."
- "Shredded duck legs keep flavor intact. Warm them in the aromatics before adding to sauce. Avoid overcooking; that ruins the rich texture. You want tender bits."
- "Mushroom stock is key, cuts down on canned flavors. Use homemade if you can. Combine well with milk and cheese for a cohesive sauce; thick but not clumpy."
- "Watch the broiler. Uses intense heat. Browning takes just a few minutes. Wait for golden spots to appear but be careful—burning can happen quickly."
faq:
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate right away in airtight container. No more than 3 days tops. Can also freeze. Just be sure to cool first, then wrap tightly."
- "q: What if no duck confit available? a: Substitute with shredded rotisserie chicken or pork shoulder. Adds different depth of flavor but still works in the dish."
- "q: Can I use different cheeses? a: Absolutely. Swap Gruyère for cheddar or gouda but flavor changes. Melting properties differ too. Test with what you have."
- "q: How to troubleshoot a too-salty dish? a: Add more cream or unsalted broth to dilute. In a pinch, stirring in a dollop of unsweetened yogurt can balance."
