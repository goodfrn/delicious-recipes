slug: "almond-paste-pear-cake"
description: "Pears stewed in wine with hints of clove and orange zest. A dense cake packed with diced almond paste for texture. Moist crumb, aromatic from dark spices. Uses cinnamon replaced with clove, and adds orange zest to poaching liquid. Less sugar, more flour for sturdier crumb. Pairs pears pressed against pan for visual impact, cake bakes wrapped stems in foil to avoid burning. Poached fruit cooled slowly in syrup for flavor depth. Baking times and steps shifted slightly to balance moist pears and bake through almond paste pieces."

ingredients:
- "=== POACHED PEARS ==="
- "700 ml (just under 3 cups) dry red wine"
- "140 ml (2/3 cup) granulated sugar"
- "1 small dried clove"
- "Zest of 1 small orange"
- "5 firm but ripe Bartlett or Anjou pears"
- ""
- "=== CAKE ==="
- "220 ml (just under 1 cup) all purpose flour"
- "2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) baking powder"
- "100 ml (about 1/2 stick) unsalted butter, softened"
- "100 ml (about 1/2 cup) granulated sugar"
- "200 g (7 oz) almond paste, diced"
- "3 eggs"
instructions:
- "=== POACHED PEARS ==="
- "Fill saucepan with wine, sugar, clove, orange zest. Bring to rolling boil; hear syrup bubble briskly before dropping heat. Simmer 2 minutes to dissolve sugar fully and bloom aromatics. Peel pears carefully keeping stalks intact. Halve pears and stalks lengthwise. Use melon baller to scoop cores avoiding seeds. Watch skin to prevent tearing."
- "Immerse pears gently in barely simmering poaching liquid. Bring back to boil—watch for tip of pear gently floating and tiny bubbles swirling. Simmer 8 to 12 minutes depending on firmness. Pears soften slightly but hold shape—skin will wrinkle gently, not collapse."
- "Remove from heat; leave pears submerged to cool slowly for at least 4 hours or overnight in fridge. This slow cool builds flavor and tenderizes flesh without musking texture."
- ""
- "=== CAKE ==="
- "Set rack center oven; preheat to 175 °C (347 °F). Butter 20 cm (8 inch) spring-form pan liberally. Line base with parchment paper, pressing paper firmly to base edges—steam prevents slip during baking."
- "Sift flour and baking powder together twice. Set aside."
- "Beat butter and sugar with electric mixer on medium-high. Looks airy and pale—should take 4-5 minutes; pancake consistency with visible butter grain. Fold in diced almond paste gradually, letting the mixer work past lumps—some small chunks remain, crunch expected."
- "Add eggs one by one, fully incorporate each before next; slows down emulsification but balances batter hold. Last egg, mix about 2 minutes until batter lighter, ribbon stage achieved. Turn mixer to low and sifted dry ingredients in two additions; fold just until flour disappears. Avoid overmixing to keep cake tender."

- "=== ASSEMBLY ==="
- "Drain poached pears from liquid, blot thoroughly with paper towels, don’t let sogginess sit. Reserve poaching syrup for cocktails or syrups later."
- "Position pear halves standing with cut side outward against pan walls; discard any stubby bases for sturdiness. Pour batter into middle, distributing evenly into corners so batter lifts pears gently."
- "Cover pear stalks with foil squares to prevent scorching during baking. Set pan center rack; bake 1 hour 20 minutes, checking doneness starting at 1:10 mark—insert wooden skewer into thickest cake zone and between pear pieces. Skewer comes out sticky but without raw batter. Look for golden-brown top, crack forming around pear edges."
- "Cool cake in pan 15 minutes at room temperature; use offset spatula to loosen sides carefully before unclipping to prevent breakage. Transfer onto wire rack to finish cooling—cake firming as it cools. Pears slightly soften against crumb, juicy but intact."

introduction: "Wine, sugar, spice reduction, pears softened without turning to mush. Almond paste diced, not melted fully for texture variation in cake crumb. Pears stand tall pressed against pan, slices subtly wedged to anchor in place during bake. Molten wine syrup imbues fruit flesh as it cools overnight—patience and time work magic here. Measurement nudged: less sugar than norm, balances against wine’s tannin and almond paste sweetness. Vanilla removed; clove swapped for cinnamon, orange zest adds brightness. The internal almond paste chunks create chewy bursts within tender crumb, breaks monotony. Not fragile, cake holds shape well—ideal for slicing thick, rich wedges. Sturdy cake batter enables elegant pear presentation without collapsing. Tips included on poach timing and checking cake with skewers instead of timers. Essential to cool pears slowly, drying prior to baking. Stem protection mandatory."
ingredientsNote: "Pears must be ripe but firm—overripe pears will disintegrate during poaching and baking phases. Bartlett preferred for sweetness; Anjou gives slight tartness; either works if fruits are fresh. Wine choice impacts final flavor heavily. Dry red wine is standard but fruity fruity or aged can change profile. Sub clove with cinnamon if needed, but avoid overpowering spices that mask pear delicacy. Orange zest adds citrus lift; can swap with lemon if preferred. Almond paste differs from marzipan—less sweet, more almond taste; diced for bursts but can be grated for finer distribution. Unsalted butter best for control—salted can cause uneven saltiness flower crumb. Flour amount increased from original for structural balance. Sugar reduced by 20% to prevent oversweetness given poached pear syrup absorbed."
instructionsNote: "Peeling pears with stem intact preserves elegance, but peeling in halves helps maintain shape during poaching—peels soften but won't fall apart if handled carefully. Poaching timing varies with ripeness; observe bubbles and pear texture, test with finger tip—slight give but no mushiness. Cooling pears in syrup overnight integrates flavors deeply—skip cool soak, pears risk drying out and flavor fades. Cake batter consistency easier to gauge visually and tactilely than by time. Diced almond paste integrating is slow process; be patient mixing to break down lumps while preserving texture. Baking with pear stalks exposed risks burning; wrap immediately once batter poured. Toothpick tests standard but check near pears to avoid uncooked pockets. Cooling in pan avoids collapsing before cake sets. Rest cake before slicing for clean cuts. Reserved poaching syrup is multipurpose: reduce for glaze or mix into drinks."
tips:
- "Use firm Bartlett or Anjou pears; overripe ones mush out. Peck too soft; no structure for cake. Simmer gently, check for slight give."
- "Cooling pears in poaching syrup overnight builds flavor, integrates; skip it, pears risk concentration loss. Patience matters with flavor."
- "Almond paste needs work. Diced pieces should stay. Patience with lumps. Fold it into butter, don’t rush. Crunch expected, mix slowly."
- "Baking time varies. Oven hot, check doneness—skewer through cake near pears. Sticky but no raw batter. Golden on top, look for cracks."
- "Cover pear stalks with foil during baking; prevents charring. Catch them early, trim pear bases for stability against pan walls. Tidy edges."
faq:
- "q: What if pears break during poaching? a: Use less heat; steady simmer. Keep an eye, don’t crowd pot. Aim too soft fails, too firm too."
- "q: Can I substitute almond paste? a: Yes but marzipan sweeter with less almond depth. Grate instead of dice if needed; uniform texture."
- "q: How to store leftover cake? a: Wrap slices tight. Refrigerate for freshness. Can freeze; thaw by leaving out, preserve textures well."
- "q: What if cake sinks after baking? a: Check mixing; batter too much air can collapse. Ensure even baking and cooling, avoid drafts."
