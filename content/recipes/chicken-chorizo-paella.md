ingredients:
- "1.2 litres vegetable broth (about 5 cups)"
- "40 ml tomato paste (approximately 2 ½ tablespoons)"
- "5 ml sweet smoked paprika"
- "1 pinch saffron threads"
- "8 chicken thighs with skin"
- "25 ml olive oil (around 1 ½ tablespoon)"
- "1 large onion, finely chopped"
- "3 cloves garlic, minced"
- "2 medium red bell peppers, seeded and sliced"
- "125 g sliced spicy sausage (substituted chorizo)"
- "440 g (2 cups) paella rice or short-grain rice"
- "140 ml dry white wine (just over ½ cup)"
- "1 can (400 ml) artichoke hearts, drained and quartered"
- "160 g frozen peas, thawed"
- "Lemon wedges, to serve"
instructions:
- "Heat broth with tomato paste and smoked paprika until bubbling. Lower heat, add saffron, salt, and pepper, keep warm."
- "Brown chicken thighs in olive oil in large deep pan on high heat. Season with salt and pepper. Add onion and garlic, cook 1-2 minutes."
- "Add red peppers and sausage slices. Season lightly, stir 2 minutes more."
- "Pour in rice, stir to coat in oil and flavors. Add wine, let reduce a minute."
- "Pour broth over rice and chicken. Simmer on medium heat without stirring for about 11 minutes."
- "Scatter artichoke hearts on top. Cook another 16 minutes or until rice is tender but with a bite and broth is thick but not dry."
- "Remove from heat, sprinkle peas over dish. Cover with lid or foil, rest 4 minutes."
- "Serve warm with lemon wedges for squeezing."
introduction: "No seafood here. Drumsticks and spicy sausage take center stage. Paprika swapped for a milder smoked version. Broth is veggie-based, richer and more layered. Artichokes add a subtle tang. Peas burst color and pop. Lemon cuts through the richness. Crisp skin on chicken counters tender rice grains. Slow simmer brings out depth, keep stirring to a minimum. Resting lets flavors settle. A homey shift on classic paella — hearty yet fresh."
ingredientsNote: "Used vegetable broth for a lighter flavor profile replacing chicken stock. Replaced chorizo with spicier sausage to boost punch. Slightly less oil but enough for crisping chicken. More garlic and an extra clove for aroma. Tomato paste quantity dropped a little to balance acidity. Paella rice or any short-grain risotto-type works best—absorbs broth without mush. Frozen peas defrosted rather than fresh for convenience. Artichoke hearts canned, rinsed and quartered maintain texture. Wine dry, not sweet, essential for reducing and de-glazing."
instructionsNote: "Broth heated first with tomato paste and paprika to unlock smoky sweet tones before saffron goes in — timing lets flavors bloom, avoid burning. Brown chicken well on high heat for rich skin color, finish on medium with veggies for tender bite, avoid overcooking garlic. Rice must toast briefly before liquid to keep grains separated. Cooking without stirring helps form socarrat - slightly caramelized bottom crust, signature of paella. Timing adjusted by a few minutes to ensure rice softness varies slightly with pan types and heat distribution. Rest time crucial to get peas warmed through without overcooking. Serve immediately after resting with bright lemon for acidity lift."
tips:
- "Start with the broth. Heat it first. Adds depth to flavors. Include tomato paste. Wait to add saffron. Helps to bloom the flavors."
- "Brown chicken on high heat. Crisp skin is essential. Don't overcook garlic. Timing is key. Finish on medium to soften veggies."
- "Toast the rice quick. Keeps grains separated. Pour in the broth. Avoid stirring while cooking. Helps form socarrat. Signature to paella."
- "Resting is important. Let sit covered. Warms peas through. Prevents overcooking. All flavors settle. Bright lemon gives acidity lift."
- "Use vegetable broth for lighter flavor profile. Guaranteed less rich than chicken stock. Adjust the oil too. Enough for crisping the chicken."
faq:
- "q: What if the rice is mushy? a: Check cooking times. Can overcook rice easily. Try slight adjustments in heat. Different pan types, too."
- "q: Can I use different sausage? a: Yes, but adjust spices. Spicy is good here. Mild sausage won’t be same. Flavor profile shifts."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate up to 3 days. Can freeze 1 month too. Just cool completely first. Then seal in container."
- "q: What if I don’t have saffron? a: Substitute with turmeric. Color but not same flavor. Or skip. The dish still works. Other spices help."
