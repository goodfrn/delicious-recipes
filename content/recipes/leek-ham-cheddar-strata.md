description: "A layered savory bread bake starring sautéed leeks, ham, aged cheddar, and crusty bread. Custard made from eggs, cream, and milk soaks through. Baked gently, then finished hot to brown layers. Tangy white wine deglaze brightens the leeks. Classic strata reworked—subtle tweaks on cheese and aromatics to lift flavor. Easy to prep ahead. Great for brunch or dinner with a simple salad. Versatile—can swap ham for smoked chicken or bacon. Texture should be custardy but set, with a crisp top. Avoid soggy by drying bread first. Signs of doneness: custard puffed, knife emerges clean, edges browning crisp."

ingredients:
- "280 g dried crusty bread chunks about 4 cm each white sourdough or country loaf"
- "1 large leek sliced thinly white and light green parts only"
- "30 ml unsalted butter"
- "2 garlic cloves minced"
- "1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves"
- "60 ml dry white wine substitute dry vermouth or chicken stock"
- "40 ml chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley plus extra for garnish"
- "5 large eggs"
- "200 ml whole milk"
- "125 ml heavy cream substitute half-and-half for lighter version"
- "170 g sliced cooked smoked ham or smoked chicken"
- "150 g sharp aged cheddar grated (replacing mimolette)"
- "20 g grated Parmesan (added twist)"
- "Extra virgin olive oil for drizzling"
- "Salt and black pepper freshly ground"
instructions:
- "Set oven rack center. Preheat oven to 140 C (285 F). Spread bread pieces evenly on baking sheet. Toast 12 minutes to dry and crisp pockets without browning too dark. Remove and cool. Increase heat to 190 C (375 F)."
- "Meanwhile, melt butter in 23cm heavy pan over medium. Add leeks; sweat until fully softened and translucent, about 9 minutes. Add garlic and thyme, stirring 1 minute till fragrant but not browned. Pour in wine; let simmer briskly until halved and syrupy—sharp reduction sharpens aroma—about 4 minutes. Stir in parsley, season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat."
- "Beat together eggs, milk, cream with pinch salt and pepper. Should be smooth, slightly frothy but no bubbles. Keeps texture silky but firm on baking."
- "Layering in same pan or a round casserole: half the dried bread, pressing lightly but not smashed. Tuck ham slices into bread gaps folding slightly for even coverage. Spread half leeks evenly over ham. Sprinkle half cheddar and half Parmesan on top. Repeat once more, ending with cheese on surface."
- "Pour custard gently over layers, gently pressing bread with spatula to soak well but keep structural integrity. Drizzle olive oil over top, freshly ground black pepper heavy dusting."
- "Cover tightly with foil. Bake 22 minutes at 190 C until edges puff up and custard is nearly set but still jiggly in center."
- "Remove foil. Increase oven to 220 C (425 F). Return dish and bake uncovered 17 minutes or until top is golden brown and crisp. Insert knife to test—should come out mostly clean with moist crumbs attached but no raw custard."
- "Cool at least 10 minutes before slicing to let custard firm. Garnish with more parsley. Serve with barely dressed green salad or pickled vegetables."
- "Leftovers reheat well in 180 C oven covered with foil for 15 minutes. Avoid microwave reheating to preserve texture."
introduction: "Strata starts simple—bread, eggs, cream—and yet it demands technique to nail the creamy center and crisp top. The trick? Dried bread first. Fresh bread traps too much liquid and turns mushy. Toasting creates structure; the pores snap open, begging for custard soak but holding shape. Leeks are sweated low and slow, coaxing out sweetness without browning. Quick deglaze with white wine cuts richness and adds sharp notes that balance cream and cheese. Using smoked ham over plain brings smoke depth—comfort food redefined. Aged cheddar swaps in for mimolette; sharper, tangier cheese makes a bolder bite. Parmesan adds a savory punch, enhancing crust browning and umami. Don't skimp on fresh herbs; thyme and parsley add freshness. Dusting black pepper before baking unlocks earthiness in final dish. Heat control is your friend here. Slow and gentle custard set then roaring hot to crispen the crust. Underbake and you get watery mess; overbake and custard dries, crunch losing creaminess. Key visual cues: edges golden, center softly wobbly but sets as it cools. Rest happens after oven. Slicing too soon will cause crumble."
ingredientsNote: "Bread is your base. Go for a sturdy sourdough or rustic country loaf. Avoid store sliced white—it gets mushy. Drying adds crunch and holds custard. Leek white and pale green only; dark greens too fibrous—save them for stock. Garlic and thyme develop aromatic backbone. White wine is classic but vermouth or even chicken stock can play backup. Parsley adds brightness but can be swapped for chives or tarragon for different herb profile. Smoked ham is ideal but smoked chicken or turkey are options. Cheese swap hinges on how sharp and aged—aged cheddar brings tang and bite distinct from mellow mimolette. Parmesan isn't a traditional strata addition but its saltiness crisps the surface beautifully. Heavy cream ensures richness; half-and-half can lighten but expect less decadence. Olive oil drizzle just before baking encourages golden crust and adds slight fruitiness. Season judiciously—bread can mute salt, so err on the side of seasoning well. Don’t forget black pepper freshly ground; it elevates flavor layers."
instructionsNote: "Preheat and dry bread first—essential to avoid soggy bottom. Bread should feel crisp with golden edges but not burnt. Keep leeks low and slow to soften without caramelizing. Caramelized bits overpower here. Deglaze pan off heat to capture all flavor, scraping fond bits gently. Egg custard whisking must be steady; no lumps, no bubbles. Bubbles create air pockets leading to uneven texture. Layer with care: press bread gently to absorb custard but don’t mash—maintain air gaps. Cheese layered inside and on top makes sure melting is uniform. Covering strata during initial baking traps steam, helping custard cook evenly. Removing foil last steps crisps crust; key for texture contrast. Watch oven temp carefully; too hot = burnt edges, too low = rubbery custard. Test doneness with knife tip; a little moisture is fine. Cooling portion helps custard finish setting; patience pays. For last-minute tweaks, swap whites for herbs like sage or replace wine with sherry. Reheating should be slow and covered; microwave ruins custard texture. Keep some olive oil handy for extra drizzle if crust looks dry before serving."
tips:
- "Start with stale bread. Fresh gets soggy. Stale is your friend. Crisp it lightly, let it dry. About 12 minutes in 140 C brings structure. Oven timing crucial."
- "Leeks need low, gentle cooking. Strong heat burns edges. Sweat for sweetness, not color. About 9 minutes till translucent—aroma fills the kitchen."
- "Egg custard texture matters. Whisk without bubbles, steady hand. Avoid lumps for even bake. Should feel slightly frothy not frothy. Key for creamy center. Patience pays off."
- "Layering is key. Press bread gently; don’t smash. Spread ingredients evenly—ham holes filled. Cheese should cover well—melt uniform. Top last with cheese for good crust."
- "Cooling helps set custard. Wait 10 minutes after baking. If sliced too soon, it falls apart. Let it rest. Patience, again, yields results in texture."
faq:
- "q: Why does my strata turn out soggy? a: Fresh bread traps wet. Always dry it first. Stale slices needed. No soggy bottom here; crisp is essential."
- "q: Can I add other ingredients? a: Yes, veggies work. Spinach or mushrooms can substitute for ham. Just adjust cook time. Baseline keeps layers intact."
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in an airtight container. Best eaten in 2-3 days. Reheat in oven, avoid microwave—texture changes."
- "q: What if my custard doesn't set? a: Underbaking? Maybe too much liquid. Knife test key—moist crumbs fine. Bake longer if center jiggly, not raw."
