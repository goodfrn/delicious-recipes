- "215 ml (7/8 cup) quick-cooking oats"
- "175 ml (3/4 cup) all-purpose flour"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) whole wheat flour"
- "95 ml (3/8 cup) brown sugar"
- "150 ml (2/3 cup) coconut oil, softened"

instructions:
- "=== Assembly and Baking ==="
- "1. Heat oven to 185 °C (365 °F). Grease a 20 cm (8 in) square pan. Position rack in middle."
- "2. In a bowl, combine oats, flours, brown sugar, and softened coconut oil. Mix till crumbly. Set aside half for topping."
- "3. In saucepan, mix 480 ml (2 cups) strawberries, arrowroot powder, and sugar. Bring to boil, stirring constantly. Simmer medium heat 3 minutes till thickened. Remove from heat. Fold in remaining fresh strawberries. Keep warm."
- "4. Press half oat mixture evenly into pan base."
- "5. Spread strawberry filling over base layer."
- "6. Crumble remaining oat mixture evenly atop fruit."
- "7. Bake 45-50 minutes until golden and crisp."
- "8. Cool at least 30 minutes before slicing."
introduction: "Started with oats. Brown sugar. Flour not quite the same amounts. Coconut oil creaming, not butter. Strawberries thickened with arrowroot, not cornstarch. Stir, simmer, then fold in fresh. Oat topping pressed halfway down, half on top. Middle rack, 185. Baking times changed up a bit, longer. Crisp edges, soft red inside. Cool properly, bars hold together better. Freshness pops through. Texture both chewy and crumbly. Easy modifications for dairy-free but still richness. Grain and sugar balances changed for crumb texture, mouthfeel. No eggs here. Vibrant red, aroma of cooked fruit, toasted oats. Fresh fruit heat-steeped, sweetness balanced. Minimal fuss. Sweet-tart strawberry layers, break apart with knife. Rustic and homey. Simple snack or light dessert. Keeping it pure."
ingredientsNote: "Oats quick-cooking for even crumb, not chewy whole flakes. Whole wheat flour adds nutty undertones and bite. Coconut oil replaces butter to avoid dairy but keeps richness and moisture. Brown sugar for deep caramel flavor and moisture retention. Arrowroot powder thickens fruit filling without cloudiness or gelatinous texture like cornstarch. Fresh strawberries cut smaller for better cooking. Sugar reduced slightly, leaves natural tartness with sweet undertones intact. Portion sizes adjusted to maintain crumble structure. Ingredients balance between soft interior and crisp topping. No eggs or nuts keeps allergy considerations easy. Slight ingredient volume changes optimize texture and bake time without complex alterations."
instructionsNote: "Oven preheated to lower temperature than usual for a gentler bake, prevents over-browning. Greased pan ensures clean bars with crisp edges. Crumble mixture combines oil into dry ingredients till pea-sized clumps form, half pressed firmly to form base crust. Fruit cooked first with starch and sugar, thickening to jam-like but not runny consistency. Remaining uncooked strawberries folded in to keep bursts of fresh texture and brightness. Topping carefully crumbled over. Bake in middle rack for even heat exposure. Total bake time extended plus-minus 5 minutes from standard for thorough cooking. Cooling mandatory - filling firms, bars slice cleanly. Cutting while hot = mushy. Chill or room temp ok. Bars serve best next day to let flavors meld but enjoy fresh too."
tips:
- "Use quick-cooking oats for crumbles. Whole, chewy oatmeal not right here. Light, airy texture matters. Coconut oil stays soft when warm. Ensure thorough blending. Don’t pack too tightly. Spread mixture evenly across pan base. Not too much pressure. You want a good crust."
- "When cooking fruit, focus on simmering. Medium heat is best. It releases juices. Avoid burning or sticking. Stir constantly for even thickening. Arrowroot makes filling clearer. No cloudiness from cornstarch. Keep the fresh strawberries intact. Careful when folding them in."
- "Bake at 185 degrees Celsius. Middle rack ensures even baking. 45 to 50 minutes time frame here. Watch for golden color. Edges should crisp, center soft. Cooling time essential. At least 30 minutes. Slicing hot creates mushy bars. Wait for firm structure."
- "Use parchment paper for easy removal. It can help with sticking. Grease pan properly. Ensure edges crisp up nice. Using firm, ripe strawberries gives the best outcome. Texture contrasts, depth in flavors. Evenly sized pieces matter."
- "Don’t overmix topping. Clumps give texture, take care. Use a mix of sugars. Brown for deep caramel notes. Granulated for balance. Adjust sugar to keep sweetness natural. Less is more with fruit freshness. Sweet-tart layers shine brightly."
faq:
- "q: Can I make these without coconut oil? a: Yes, but coconut oil gives moisture. Use unsalted butter or a plant-based alternative. Adjust measurements slightly. Process still needs care."
- "q: What if I can't find arrowroot powder? a: You can use cornstarch. But filling may turn cloudy. Slightly thicker texture too. Adjust cooking time if using gelatin. A few other options exist."
- "q: My bars are too crumbly? a: They may need more moisture. Coconut oil must be well incorporated. Press base layer firmly. Cooling too much but will help with structure."
- "q: How should I store these? a: Keep in an airtight container. Room temperature okay for a few days. Refrigerate longer for freshness. Can freeze for later. Be sure to slice first."
