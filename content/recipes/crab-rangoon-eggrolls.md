slug: "crab-rangoon-eggrolls"
description: "Crunchy fried wrappers filled with a creamy blend of ricotta and surimi flakes, brightened by scallions and a hint of soy. Replaces traditional cream cheese with ricotta, Worcestershire swapped for soy sauce for umami punch. The fry time shifts slightly to catch the perfect golden crackle. Egg rolls wrapped tight, sealed with egg wash. Fried until bubbles subside and surface crisps with that audible snap. Serve with sweet chili for a balance of heat and sugar. Avoid breaking crab or overfilling wrappers to keep them intact during frying."

ingredients:
- "canola oil enough to fill deep fryer to fill line"
- "8 ounces ricotta cheese softened"
- "1 teaspoon soy sauce instead of Worcestershire"
- "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder"
- "1/2 teaspoon onion powder"
- "6 ounces surimi stick flakes drained (substitute lump crab as alternative)"
- "3 green onions thinly sliced"
- "1 large egg"
- "1 tablespoon water"
- "12 egg roll wrappers"
- "sweet chili sauce for serving"
- "extra sliced green onions for garnish"
instructions:
- "Fill deep fryer bowl with enough canola oil to the fill line. Heat to 345°F; slightly cooler than usual to prevent overbrowning before filling heats through."
- "In a medium bowl, mix softened ricotta, soy sauce, garlic powder, and onion powder using a spatula until fully combined. Ricotta's looser texture requires thorough mixing for even flavor distribution."
- "Fold in surimi flakes gently with scallions, careful not to mash flakes; keep lumps intact to prevent mushy filling."
- "Whisk egg and water in a small bowl to create egg wash; this acts as glue to seal egg rolls well."
- "Lay out one egg roll wrapper on clean surface diamond-shaped. Brush 1-inch border on all sides lightly with egg wash using a pastry brush; ensures edges stick properly."
- "Using a tablespoon measure, scoop about 3 tablespoons of filling and shape into a 3½-inch log horizontally near center of wrapper."
- "Fold left corner over filling to halfway point; then fold right corner overlapping left to halve wrapper over filling."
- "Fold top corner down over these folds, then tightly roll egg roll away from you, tucking wrapper edges in as tight as possible. Add egg wash if sealing gaps to avoid oil seepage."
- "Place each formed egg roll on parchment-lined tray. Repeat until all filling is used up."
- "Lower basket with 3–4 egg rolls into oil. Fry at 345°F about 3-4 minutes until wrapper bubbles and golden brown-amber, texture crisp but shell still thin and crackly."
- "Use tongs to gently move basket occasionally so rolls don’t stick. Listen for that steady sizzle fade as sign done inside."
- "Remove from oil, draining on paper towels. Let rest a minute to firm before cutting or serving."
- "Plate egg rolls, garnish with extra sliced green onion and provide sweet chili sauce on side for dipping."
introduction: "Not your classic cream cheese crab rangoons. Swapped for ricotta — lighter texture, less tang but rich. Surimi stands in for real crab: affordable, plentiful, still flaky. Soy sauce punches up flavor, replacing Worcestershire’s complexity with a cleaner salty umami. Fry heat eased down a bit — overheated oil means burnt shell but cold mid — no thanks. Roll tight, seal good. Wet edges or filling overfill invites leaks or blowups mid-fry. Listen for high-temperature crepitus as oil bubbles calm: doneness signal. Rest on paper towels to rest, let steam escape; stops sogginess. Sweet chili counters richness: balance of sweet heat with creamy inside, crispy shell outside. When done, you’ll hear the crunch before you taste it."
ingredientsNote: "Ricotta is a good stand-in for cream cheese when you want less pronounced tang and a silkier mouthfeel. Surimi flakes instead of crab lower cost, keep texture flaky if folded carefully; lump crab can substitute but results in chunkier bites. Soy sauce is easier to find than Worcestershire in some pantries, and adds a fresher salty umami. Canola is a good neutral oil for deep frying — holds stable at 350°F. Egg wash seals the wrappers better than water and prevents unravelling under the oil's movement; thin brush strokes avoid excess wetness that weakens wrapper edges. Thinly sliced green onions provide sharp freshness to contrast creamy filling and crispy wrapper. Keep wrappers covered with a damp towel while working to avoid drying out or cracking."
instructionsNote: "Heating oil consistently to around 345–350°F is key; too hot and the wrapper darkens quickly but inside stays cold, too low and oil will soak in. Test oil by flicking a small piece of wrapper in; should sizzle and float quickly. Mixing filling well ensures even seasoning; folding crab or surimi gently keeps texture intact. Work with one wrapper at a time to keep them from drying and cracking. Wrappers folded diamond-shaped, brushed well with egg wash on edges ensures tight seal and neat roll. Rolling tight helps avoid hot oil entering and filling falling out. Fry in batches to avoid overcrowding which drops oil temperature. Use tongs to gently swirl basket but don’t aggressively shake, which tears wraps. Drain well on paper towels and avoid stacking while hot to preserve crisp texture."
tips:
- "Keep oil at 345°F; too hot burns wrappers; too low soaks them. Flick a small wrapper piece in—sizzle means it's ready. Check frequently."
- "Ricotta in for cream cheese—less tang, silkier. Surimi's budget-friendly; lump crab works but gives a chunkier bite. Taste matters, choose wisely."
- "Don't overfill wrappers—leads to breaks and leaks. A tablespoon is about right; three tablespoons maximum. Feel the weight of filling. Good balance."
- "Roll tight and seal well; gaps let oil in. Egg wash—sticks better than water. Brush thin; too much weakens edges. Keep them covered when not rolling."
- "Rest fried rolls on paper towels—drain well. Stacking can sog them; avoid it. Let steam escape; keep that crunch alive. Cool briefly before serving."
faq:
- "q: How do I keep egg rolls from leaking? a: Roll tight. Seal well with egg wash. No gaps allowed. Overfill leads to leaks. Be careful."
- "q: What if I can't find surimi? a: Lump crab works well; gets chunkier bites. Or try imitation crab. Flavor changes slightly—still tasty."
- "q: What's a common frying mistake? a: Oil too hot or cold causes issues. Keep at 345°F; check temp often. Monitor bubbles—consistent sizzle is key."
- "q: Can I make these ahead? a: Yes, wrap tightly and refrigerate. Fry them fresh when ready. Can freeze too; but fry straight from freezer, adjust time."
