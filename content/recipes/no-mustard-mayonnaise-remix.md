Garlic optional, minced tiny. Salt and pepper finish. No mustard here. Changes: oil drops from 1 cup to 180 ml, vinegar cut to 2 teaspoons, garlic swapped for shallot for different bite. Time tweaked, yolk warming 3 minutes, whisking 10 minutes total. Creamy, tangy mayo without typical mustard twist."

ingredients:
- "2 egg yolks"
- "10 ml white wine vinegar"
- "10 ml water"
- "180 ml canola oil"
- "1/2 small shallot, minced"
- "Salt"
- "Pepper"
instructions:
- "Set bowl over simmering water. Whisk egg yolks with vinegar and water about 3 minutes, warm and frothy but not scrambled."
- "Remove bowl from heat."
- "Add one third of oil dropwise, whisk constantly until thickened and starting to emulsify."
- "Continue adding rest of oil in thin stream while whisking vigorously."
- "Stir minced shallot in."
- "Season with salt and pepper to taste."
- "Transfer to airtight container. Chill up to one week."
introduction: "Egg yolks warmed over water, a careful whisk creates the beginnings of something creamy. Forget mustard. Vinegar and water add acidity without sharp spice. Oil dribbled slowly changes liquid to thick emulsion. Garlic? No, minced shallot instead; brash and delicate all at once. Salt and pepper round out. Timing is key. Heat too high, egg yolks scramble. Too slow, no body. Three minutes warming, ten whisking. Tiny changes ripple. Less oil than usual, sharper vinegar role. Cool this mix down. Use as dip, spread, base for dressings. Simple method altered subtly, texture still rich, flavor shifting quietly."
ingredientsNote: "Use fresh egg yolks, very important to avoid toughness. White wine vinegar balances acidity with mild tartness, water tempers. Canola oil neutral, good for binding. Replacing garlic with shallot gives subtle onion note without overpowering. Adjust oil quantity down to 180 ml; creates lighter mayo, easier to emulsify. Salt and pepper essential for flavor lift. Mince shallot finely to avoid graininess. Refrigerate after preparation to set. Allergen free, gluten free. No mustard meant avoiding typical sharp bite, shifting flavor profile gently. Use fresh ingredients for best outcome."
instructionsNote: "Work quickly but carefully. Whisk egg yolks, vinegar, and water over barely simmering water — temp control prevents scrambling. Three minutes enough to warm and aerate. Remove from heat before thickening, stop cooking. Add oil slowly at first, drip by drip, whisk constantly — patience key. When emulsion builds, oil goes in faster, thin steady stream. Stir in minced shallot at end for crisp bite. Season after. Transfer promptly to clean airtight container for safety. Chill a few hours before use to thicken more. Tweak oil quantity if too thick or thin. Keep stirring to keep emulsion stable. Lasts about a week refrigerated. Avoid mustard but get creamy, tangy spread all the same."
tips:
- "Keep egg yolks fresh. Freshness means no toughness, a key for smooth texture. Room temp yolks help emulsify. Use highest quality ingredients."
- "Control heat while whisking, essential. Too much heat? Scramble. Too little? No body forms. Watch closely. Three-minute warm up works best."
- "Add oil slow at start, crucial for emulsion. Drip by drip till thick, then a steady stream. Timing is everything, patient whisking key."
- "Minced shallots? Yes, but tiny pieces. Big chunks ruin mayo feel and taste. Balance flavor, no overwhelm. Think light onion notes."
- "Remember storage tips. Use clean containers. Refrigerate right away for best results. Mayo lasts up to a week if done correctly."
faq:
- "q: How to fix broken mayo? a: If it separates, try whisking in another yolk. Or, drizzle in more oil slowly while whisking. Stabilize the emulsion."
- "q: Alternatives to canola oil? a: You could use light olive oil. Or, avocado oil for a twist. Be careful with flavors though, they change everything."
- "q: What if it's too thick? a: Thin it out with a little water or lemon juice. Just a few drops at a time. Blend well, adjust as needed."
- "q: Can I use this mayo for dressings? a: Absolutely, mix with yogurt for creaminess. Use herbs and spices for variety, keep experimenting for flavors."
