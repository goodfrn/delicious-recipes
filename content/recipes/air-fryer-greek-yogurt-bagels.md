description: "Bagels made quick with Greek yogurt and baking powder, air-fried to golden crisp. Sesame seeds adding crunch, olive oil brushing for deep color. The dough is dense, no yeast fuss. Swaps chickpea flour for half the all-purpose, swaps olive oil for melted butter for a subtle richness. Twist of dried thyme inside, a hint in the crumb. Baked inside air fryer for that crackly skin, soft snap when bitten. Avoid overmixing; dough benefits from light handling. Watch for color, not just time. Best served cool or toasted with herb cream cheese or avocado smash."

ingredients:
- "110 g (3⁄4 cup) all-purpose flour non-bleached"
- "40 g (1⁄3 cup) chickpea flour"
- "6 ml (1 1⁄4 tsp) baking powder"
- "4 ml (3⁄4 tsp) granulated sugar"
- "2 ml (1⁄2 tsp) fine sea salt"
- "1 ml (1⁄4 tsp) baking soda"
- "220 ml (7⁄8 cup) Greek yogurt full fat"
- "1 egg white, lightly beaten"
- "20 g (2 tbsp) melted unsalted butter"
- "20 g (3 tbsp) toasted sesame seeds"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) dried thyme leaves"
instructions:
- "Mix the flours, baking powder, sugar, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl. Sift if lumpy. Stir in dried thyme leaves."
- "Add Greek yogurt and combine roughly with a spatula until shaggy dough forms. Use hands quickly to gather dough into a firm ball. Don’t overwork; just till uniform. Too much handling = tough bagels."
- "Lightly flour surface. Divide into 4 equal portions. Shape each into 10 inch (25cm) ropes. Pinch ends tightly to seal bagel ring about 4 inches (10cm) diameter. Double pinch to prevent splitting during cook."
- "Brush lightly with egg white on all sides. Spread sesame seeds in shallow plate. Roll bagels in seeds until coated evenly. No clumps. Shake off excess sesame."
- "Heat air fryer to 185°C (365°F). Brush basket with leftover butter to prevent sticking."
- "Place two bagels cut side down (seeded side up) inside. Don’t crowd. Cook 7 minutes. You want a subtle puff, light golden crust forming. If dough feels soft, more time."
- "Flip gently using tongs or fork. Brush tops with melted butter again. Cook another 7-8 minutes until deep golden brown and hollow-sounding when tapped."
- "Remove and cool on rack before slicing. The crumb finishes setting as it cools. Warm bagels may flatten if sliced too early."
- "Repeat with remaining two bagels. For crunchier crust, add extra minute per side but watch for burns - sugar causes quick browning."
- "Serve with herb yogurt spread, or smashed avocado with lemon juice. Store leftovers wrapped to keep chewy texture."
introduction: "Bagels without yeast? Yes, and skips the rise wait. Greek yogurt acts as binder, adds moisture, and creates tender crumb. Baking powder plus soda gives gentle lift. Chickpea flour? Adds earthy undertone + protein bump, plus unique nutty scent. Butter swap for olive oil rounds flavor richer. Air fryer zones in perfect browning, crisp crust formation without grease puddles. Watch dough firmness as you handle it; wetter dough = sad saggy bagels. Coating seeds on wet egg white sticks better versus whole egg, less drippy. Timing not set in stone; brown color, firm feeling key. Herbs folded in give welcome surprise with each bite. Bagels meant for immediate consumption but hold surprisingly well wrapped next day."
ingredientsNote: "Flours balanced between all-purpose and chickpea for texture contrast. Chickpea offers protein, subtle flavor twist; sub oat or spelt flour if unavailable but expect crumb to vary. Baking powder should be fresh; flat rise is a sign it’s old. Sugar balances baking soda’s alkaline bite. Yogurt moisture controls tenderness—greek preferred but thick plain yogurt also works; must not be runny. Egg white aids seed adhesion, white keeps color bright; whole egg yellows crust more. Butter instead of oil adds depth, yes oil is lighter but butter crisps better at edges. Sesame seeds toasted beforehand intensify aroma and crunch but not mandatory; poppy or flax seeds good alternatives. Thyme optional; try rosemary or za’atar for different profile."
instructionsNote: "Start with dry mix; sift to avoid lumps that create dense pockets. Adding yogurt last prevents over mixing flour development—goal is minimal gluten formation for soft results. Use hands lightly, still dough feels firm not sticky. Rope shaping critical; length and diameter uniform for consistent cooking. Pinch well ends so bagels don’t open and lose shape. Egg white brushing results in even glue for seeds; less messy than beaten whole egg. Greens or herbs can false stick wet seeds, so dry surface first thoroughly. Air fryer basket greased or non-stick as dough sticky. Cook first side until skin slightly dries surface, flip carefully - early flipping = dough tear. Butter brushing after flip enhances color and aroma. Visual clues over clock; golden-dense crust with some browning is target. Crackle sound when tapping signals done crumb. Cooling lets steam settle inside; cutting hot lets crumb collapse making bagel dense. Avoid folding dough too long or bagels get too tough. Store wrapped in paper towel and plastic; refrigerating dries crumb quickly so use within 1 day or freeze."
tips:
- "Dough needs minimal handling. Overmixing leads to tough bagels. Just combine until shaggy. If too sticky, flour lightly. Better to chill than add too much flour."
- "Pinching bagel ends tightly seals the shape. If they split, work on pinch technique. Ensure ropes uniform in size for consistent cooking; shape tightly."
- "Look for tactile clues. If soft when flipping, cook longer on first side. Golden crust means it’s time to flip. Visual cues trump clock times."
- "Cooling is crucial. Steam needs to settle inside. Slice too soon; crumb collapses. For best results, wrap leftover bagels to maintain texture."
- "Experiment with flavors. Change thyme for rosemary or za’atar. Infuse dough with garlic or lemon zest for savory notes. Switch sesame seeds for poppy or flax."
faq:
- "q: How to store bagels? a: Wrap in paper towel then plastic. Keeps fresh for hours. Don't refrigerate, it dries out fast. Freeze for longer life."
- "q: Seeds won't stick, what to do? a: Brush extra egg white if needed. Press seeds on gently. Whole eggs can be messy; egg whites create better adhesion."
- "q: What if dough is too wet? a: Flour hands slightly, don’t go overboard. Consider chilling for 10 mins. Sticky dough can mean softer bagels or flat results."
- "q: Can I use different yogurt? a: Yes, but make sure it’s thick. Thin yogurt leads to damp dough. Substitute Greek with thick plain yogurt, texture varies."
