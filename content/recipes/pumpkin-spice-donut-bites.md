description: "Baked pumpkin donut holes with buttery cinnamon sugar coating. Uses pumpkin puree swapped for canned pumpkin. Buttermilk replaced by yogurt for tang and texture. Quick to prep, bake until toothpick clean and donut balls spring back when pressed. Coating involves melted butter tossed coating twice to get even coverage. Cinnamon sugar topping adds crunch and warmth. Yield about 40 donut holes, snack-sized. Frozen pumpkin chunks can work in pinch but puree preferred. Watch for batter thickness, adjust flour slightly if too sticky or dry. Donut holes puff lightly, not deep-fried. Oven heat caramelizes sugar topping, aroma fills kitchen with autumn spice notes."

ingredients:
- "All-purpose flour 2 1/4 cups"
- "Sugar 3/4 cup"
- "Baking powder 2 1/2 teaspoons"
- "Pumpkin pie spice 1 1/4 tablespoons"
- "Salt 1/2 teaspoon"
- "Plain yogurt 3/4 cup (sub for buttermilk)"
- "Pumpkin puree 3/4 cup"
- "Vanilla extract 1 1/2 teaspoons"
- "Egg 1 large"
- "Unsalted butter 4 tablespoons melted plus 6 tablespoons melted for coating"
- "Ground cinnamon 1 1/2 tablespoons"
- "Additional sugar 3/4 cup for coating"
instructions:
- "=== Preparation ==="
- "Heat oven to 345 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease two baking sheets or line with parchment paper. Silicone mats fine but parchment absorbs moisture better."
- "=== Dry Mix ==="
- "In large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, pumpkin pie spice, and salt. Check for lumps. This layering ensures even leavening."
- "=== Wet Mix ==="
- "Separate bowl: combine yogurt, pumpkin puree, vanilla, egg, melted butter. Stir well until homogeneous. Warm butter integrates better."
- "=== Incorporate ==="
- "Pour wet into dry mix. Fold carefully with spatula. Don’t over mix or gluten overdevelops, tough donut balls. Batter thick, sticky, that’s right."
- "=== Shaping ==="
- "Grease hands lightly, scoop about tablespoon of batter each. Shape into rough balls—perfection isn’t mandatory here. Space on sheets minimum 1 1/2 to 2 inches for expansion."
- "=== Baking ==="
- "Bake one sheet at a time to maintain consistent heat. Check around 14 minutes, toothpick clean means done. Donut holes should spring back when gently poked, slight golden edges visible."
- "=== Cooling ==="
- "Cool on wire rack five minutes, not more or coating won’t stick well."
- "=== Coating Prep ==="
- "Divide donut holes into two groups. Place each batch in large resealable plastic bags. Pour half melted butter over each batch, seal tight, shake vigorously until evenly coated."
- "=== Sugar Coating ==="
- "Mix cinnamon sugar in bowl, then transfer to clean bag. Half donut holes with half sugar mixture per bag. Shake again until coated thickly. Remove donut holes, set on tray to cool and crystallize."
- "=== Serving ==="
- "Serve warm. Can hold brief period at room temperature before coating sogs."
- "=== Substitutions & Tips ==="
- "Use mashed sweet potato or squash puree if no pumpkin. Yogurt substitutes for buttermilk give similar tang and tender crumb. Butter can be browned for nutty flavor. Baking sheets spaced properly avoids steaming; crisp exterior preferred. If batter too stiff, add teaspoon milk at a time. Avoid overbaking or dry texture. Cinnamon sugar ratio adjustable per taste."
introduction: "Want quick autumn bites no deep frying? Start with pumpkin puree, swap in yogurt for that tang replacing buttermilk. The batter thick, very stick-to-your-hands consistency, perfect for shaping. Don’t get tempted to overmix; gluten will toughen the final product. Oven at 345 hits the sweet spot—enough heat to puff but not blister donut holes. Moist crumbs inside, lightly crisp outside. Butter-cinnamon sugar done in bags, keeps hands clean, coats evenly. Watch for golden edges and toothpick test instead of clock. Scent of pumpkin spice meanwhile fills the kitchen, warming more than just the oven. Perfect for snack lockers or breakfast treats when cooled properly."
ingredientsNote: "Flours and sweeteners can vary by brand and season—always sift flour for best fold and volume. If using fresh pumpkin, roast and puree then drain excess liquid to prevent runny batter affecting rise. Yogurt acts as acid to activate baking powder, can substitute with sour cream if needed. Butter essential for richness; unsalted preferred to control seasoning. Cocoa powder could be added for fall twist or swap pumpkin spice with chai blend for different aroma. Cinnamon sugar ratio adjustable for topping crunch. Grease hands with oil or butter to avoid batter sticking during ball shaping."
instructionsNote: "Heat oven fully, temperature consistency is key for even puffing—don’t open door too often. Greasing pans or using parchment avoids sticking and sogginess from steam. Mix dry ingredients first for uniform leavening distribution. Combining melted butter in wet mix helps integrate fat with minimal gluten development. Don’t overwork batter; lumps okay. Shape batting with lightly greased fingers to prevent tearing, spacing for air circulation. Bake single sheet for controlled heat, test with toothpick not just timer. Cooling short or longer affects sugar coating grip. Buttering donut holes in bags is efficient, keep shaking vigorous for full coverage before cinnamon sugar finish. Serve warm for best texture, storage in airtight container preserves moisture but may soften sugar crust."
tips:
- "Use fresh, homemade pumpkin puree if possible. It has a better taste and texture. If using canned, check consistency. Adjust flour if the batter is too runny."
- "Don't skip warming butter before mixing. It helps blend better. Prevents clumping when you mix wet and dry. Mix dry ingredients first for proper rise."
- "Shape donut holes with lightly greased hands. Avoid too much flour; it toughens them. Space them well on sheets. Be generous—doesn't stick if you do it right."
- "Baking sheets should be used one at a time for even browning. Heat consistency is crucial. Open the oven sparingly. Look for slight golden edges."
- "Cooling is key. Five minutes max on the rack. If too long, sugar coating won’t adhere well. Serve warm for best texture; room temp is okay but avoid sogginess."
faq:
- "q: How to ensure they puff up right? a: Use right oven temp. Don’t rush. Look for those golden edges. Toothpick test for doneness."
- "q: Alternatives for pumpkin? a: Sweet potato works well. Mashed squash is another good option. Yogurt can be subbed with sour cream too."
- "q: What if the dough is too sticky? a: Add flour little by little. Just a teaspoon at a time. Check consistencies often; you want thick but manageable."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Airtight container keeps them soft but may soften coating. Best enjoyed within a couple days. You can freeze them for longer storage."
