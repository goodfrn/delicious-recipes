ingredients:
- "=== Dressing ==="
- "80 ml olive oil"
- "25 ml rice vinegar"
- "15 ml agave syrup"
- "1 garlic clove halved"
- "1 small serrano chili seeded or to taste"
- ""
- "=== Salad ==="
- "3 multi-colored bell peppers, quartered, seeded"
- "500 g large shrimp (12-16), peeled with tails, patted dry"
- "1 egg"
- "50 g arrowroot powder"
- "130 g baby spinach leaves"
- "3 ripe nectarines, pitted and thinly sliced"
- "2 Lebanese cucumbers halved lengthwise, cut in segments"
- "40 ml torn Thai basil leaves"
- "40 ml torn mint leaves"
- "Vegetable oil for frying"
instructions:
- "=== Dressing ==="
- "In a small blender, blitz olive oil, rice vinegar, agave, garlic, and chili until smooth. Season with salt. If too thick, add 1-2 tsp water. Set aside to infuse flavors."
- ""
- "=== Salad ==="
- "Fire up grill to medium-low heat. Brush grates with oil to prevent sticking."
- "Lay bell peppers on grill skin-side down. Listen for sizzling. Grill 7-9 minutes while flipping once. Peppers should be tender with blistered skin popping under finger pressure. Remove, cool slightly. Dice into bite-size cubes."
- "Heat about 5 cm of vegetable oil in a deep pan to around 175°C (350°F). Use a candy or deep-fry thermometer if you have one. Oil too cool? Shrimp soggy; too hot? Burnt crust."
- "Make a shallow slit down shrimp backs, butterfly slightly but keep intact. Press shrimp flat enough so they'll crisp evenly."
- "Beat egg in a shallow dish. Spread arrowroot in another."
- "Dip shrimp first in egg, let excess drip, then dredge in arrowroot powder. Shake off excess flour to avoid clumps, which will turn gummy and greasy."
- "Fry shrimp in batches of 3-4. Don't crowd the pan. Stir gently every 30 seconds to keep shrimp separated and crisp. Look for bright golden color and firm texture, about 2.5-3.5 minutes depending on shrimp size. Drain on paper towel or wire rack. Sprinkle with salt while hot."
- "On serving plates, distribute spinach, cucumber chunks, peach slices, and grilled peppers evenly."
- "Top with crispy shrimp. Drizzle dressing generously over everything. Finish with torn basil and mint leaves sprinkled on top."
- "Serve immediately while shrimp still crunchy and salad fresh."
introduction: "Shrimp crusted with arrowroot rather than usual cornstarch gives a lighter, crisper crust that won't get greasy quickly. Tropical sweetness from nectarines brightens the smoky char from blistered peppers. Cucumbers add crunch and freshness, balancing soft spinach leaves. The dressing kicks up heat with serrano chili instead of habanero — a milder, more manageable punch but keeps depth with garlic and honey-like agave. Grill peppers low and slow to coax out natural sugars and soften skins, no charred bitterness. Fried shrimp pop with golden crunch — avoid overcrowding to keep bath temp steady. Herbs finish with aromatic bursts, a vivid splash amid textures. No mayonnaise here. No dairy fuss. Straightforward, showoff-worthy."
ingredientsNote: "Switch bell peppers with thick-fleshed roasted tomatoes if peppers unavailable — char still matters for sweet balance. Agave syrup replaces honey for smooth sweetness without crystallization risk. Arrowroot powder offers a gluten-free, light alternative to cornstarch that crisps beautifully but absorbs less oil. Small serrano chili keeps the heat adjustable; substitute with jalapeño if preferred milder. Use Lebanese cucumbers for their thin skin and crisp texture but regular English cucumber works if peeled and deseeded to avoid sogginess. Fresh Thai basil and mint are crucial; dried herbs won't deliver same fragrant brightness. For frying oil, canola or sunflower are stable high-heat options; avoid extra virgin olive oil here due to low smoke point."
instructionsNote: "Pat shrimp dry to ensure coating adheres properly, or you'll get soggy spots. Butterfly shrimp by gently slicing back to open flat without breaking apart — more surface area crisps better. Let grilled peppers cool briefly before dicing to prevent heat wilting other ingredients prematurely. Fry in small batches to maintain oil temperature; crowded oil lowers heat leading to greasy shrimp. Stir shrimp gently in oil to avoid sticking but don't over-handle or crust will break. Salt the shrimp immediately once drained — seasoning penetrates better while hot. Toss salad just before serving to keep spinach crisp, herbs fresh, and peaches juicy. Dress last step — makes sure flavors don’t turn salad soggy. Keep an eye on your grill heat; too hot will blacken peppers but leave inside undercooked and bitter. Instead of blending dressing in blender, can grate garlic finely and mince chili to infuse oil slowly if pressed for time."
tips:
- "Crisping shrimp? Dry thoroughly. More moisture means soggy crust. Butterfly shrimp right. More surface area equals crispness. Oil temp crucial. Around 175°C. Check often."
- "Grilling peppers, medium-low heat. Flip once. Listen for sizzling. 7-9 minutes for tender goodness. Cool, then dice. Slices need to be bite-sized, not too big."
- "If arrowroot isn't available, cornstarch works. Just know it can be greasier. For the dressing, garlic can be minced instead of blended. Infusing flavors slowly is key."
- "Don't overcrowd the frying pan. Oil temp drops, shrimp turns greasy. Fry in small batches. A candy thermometer helps keep things on point. Golden color is your signal."
- "Dress salad at the last minute. Keeps everything fresh. Toss just before serving. Use fresh herbs. Substitutions won’t yield the same aromatic punch. Always salt shrimping hot."
faq:
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Can keep in the fridge. Shrimp, salad separate. Make sure shrimp isn't soggy. Crisp is key. Salad better fresh."
- "q: Can veggies be changed? a: Absolutely. Carrots, zucchini work well. Grilled tomatoes if peppers are gone. Keep an eye on cooking times."
- "q: What if shrimp aren’t available? a: Chicken can work but adjust cooking time. Or firm tofu for a vegetarian option. Texture changes, worth noting."
- "q: Dressing too thick? a: Add water to thin it out. Small amounts. Blend lightly again. Balance flavors so one doesn't overpower another too much."
