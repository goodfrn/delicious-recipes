description: "Brown sugar butter base with chocolate chips and mini marshmallows folded in. Teddy Grahams pressed on top for crunch and that graham flavor punch. Baked until edges turn golden and center sets but stays tender. Classic s'mores elements reinterpreted into an easy bar form. Swap milk chocolate with chunks or use butterscotch chips if out. Marshmallows can be mini or chopped regular. Adjust bake timing per oven quirks. Watch browning closely; overbake and dry out. Cooling fully locks in texture and eases cutting for neat squares. 12 rustic bars with crunchy, gooey, rich layers."

ingredients:
- "1 cup unsalted butter softened"
- "3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar"
- "2 large eggs"
- "1 tablespoon vanilla extract"
- "2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour"
- "1 teaspoon baking powder"
- "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1 1/4 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips"
- "1 1/2 cups mini marshmallows"
- "1 1/2 cups Teddy Grahams"
instructions:
- "1 Preheat oven to 355F. Spray 9x13 pan or line with parchment. The slight uptick in temperature speeds caramelization at edges but watch closely."
- "2 Beat softened butter and dark brown sugar with paddle attachment or wooden spoon until light and fluffy- about 3 minutes. This aeration yields tender crumb. Don’t skimp on mixing here."
- "3 Add eggs one at a time, beating until absorbed then stir in vanilla extract. Whole eggs bring moisture; yolks add richness. Extra vanilla deepens flavor."
- "4 Whisk all-purpose flour, baking powder, and kosher salt in separate bowl. Sifting helps avoid pockets of leavener that cause irregular rise."
- "5 Fold dry ingredients gradually into wet. Mix until no streaks but do not overbeat to prevent toughness. Stop as soon as combined."
- "6 Fold in 1 1/4 cups chocolate chips and marshmallows. Coat marshmallows lightly with flour beforehand if overly sticky to prevent clumping."
- "7 Divide dough onto prepared pan. Use offset spatula or wet fingers to spread evenly across bottom. Should fill pan completely but not too thick."
- "8 Press Teddy Grahams gently but firmly across surface. This adds crisp contrast and that signature graham flavor note; press ensures they don’t pop off during bake."
- "9 Bake 23-25 minutes. Edges turn golden brown and center will look set but puffy. Jiggle test: dough should not wobble or look raw in middle."
- "10 Remove from oven. Let cool fully in pan on wire rack for at least 1 hour. Cooling solidifies structure; cutting too early muddies bars."
- "11 Slice into 12 squares with serrated knife or warm blade for clean edges."
- "12 Store tightly covered at room temp up to 3 days or freeze up to 1 month."
introduction: "Butter and brown sugar cream together until fluffy—this is foundation for tender chew, air folded in for right texture. Eggs add structure but don’t overwork, or bars turn tough. Vanilla punches flavor deep. Flour mix pre-sifted—avoid leathery bars or uneven rise from clumpy leavener. Mini marshmallows coax gooey pockets while chocolate chips weave in pockets of melted richness. Teddy Grahams pressed on top bring crunch, graham flavor, and nostalgic bite. Temperature trick with 355F promotes caramelization around edges without burning. Cool completely—cutting while warm ruins bar shape. Watch colors not clock, edges golden deep honey shade, center firm and puffed but not cracked. Simple ingredients, layered textures, and spot-on timing rule here. Small shifts in baking time or ingredient ratios change feel completely—read dough and bar visual cues closely for best results. Your stove, pan, ingredients all talk back if you listen. Everything about these bars is about balance—sweet, chewy, crisp."
ingredientsNote: "Butter must be softened but not melted, room temp works best for creaming to trap air. Dark brown sugar adds moisture and depth compared to light. Eggs large size standard for consistency. Vanilla extract from pure source, not imitation, elevates flavor. Flour should be fresh; measure by spooning flour into cup and leveling off with knife to avoid dense bars. Baking powder fresh and sifted prevents uneven rise or gritty pockets. Kosher salt brings brightness to balance sweetness. Semi-sweet chips hold up under heat without fully melting out; alternatives like butterscotch or white chips change flavor profile but function similarly. Marshmallows: mini size disperses gooeyness evenly; can chop larger into smaller pieces if needed. Teddy Grahams pressed onto surface give necessary crunch and unmistakable graham flavor, important to push firmly in or they’ll slide off when baking. Can swap for crushed graham crackers; texture differs but flavor remains. Whole batch fits standard 9x13 pan; using smaller pan increases thickness and bake time. Always line pan with parchment or use a high quality nonstick spray to avoid sticking and allow for easy removal and clean cuts."
instructionsNote: "Preheat at least 15 minutes before starting. The initial creaming step traps air that translates into tender chew; don’t rush mixing, use paddle attachment or sturdy spoon. Incorporate eggs slowly, ensuring each fully blends in before next addition to avoid curdling. When combining flour mixture, fold gently; over mixing activates gluten, toughening outcome. Do not forget sifting flour, baking powder, and salt together—delivers even rise and no salty pockets. Coat marshmallows lightly with flour if very sticky, avoids them clumping in dough. Spread dough evenly using a wet spatula or fingers so bars bake uniformly. Press Teddy Grahams directly into dough; if loose they fall off or brown unevenly. Baking is precise: edges golden caramel color, center puffy but set. Do jitter test by gently shaking pan; if center jiggles like liquid more time needed. Remove promptly to avoid drying edges. Cooling at room temp for an hour locks moisture and makes slicing neat; cutting when warm causes squished, crumbly bars. Use serrated knife warmed under hot water, wiped dry for clean slices. Bars keep at room temp in airtight container 2-3 days or freeze tightly wrapped up to a month. Let thaw fully before slicing to maintain texture. If dough too sticky, refrigerate 10-15 minutes for ease of handling."
tips:
- "Butter soft but not melted. Room temp essential for creaming. Cream for air, light texture. Eggs added slowly. Mix eggs in fully, prevents curdling. Sift flour for even rise. Skip clumps."
- "Mix dry into wet ingredients gently. Avoid overmixing. Fold till combined, not tough. Press Teddy Grahams firmly. Ensure they stick. Watch edges for golden brown. Center should look set but puffed."
- "Cooling time crucial. Let pan sit for an hour at room temp. Cut too early, bars fall apart. Use serrated knife dipped in hot water for cleaner slices. Airtight container for storage."
- "Baking temperature at 355F speeds caramelization. Edges golden not burnt. Use visual cues. Clean up is easy if lined. Prevent sticking with parchment. Stickiness? Chill dough briefly."
- "Dough too soft? Baking time can shift depending on oven. Test centers; wobbling means more time. Add-ins can change; adjust texture. Butterscotch chips for a twist."
faq:
- "q: What if bars are dry? a: Adjust baking time. Maybe overbaked. Don’t forget cooling. Ensure moisture locked in. Rich texture is key."
- "q: Can I use different chocolate? a: Yes. Dark chocolate chunks give richness. White chocolate changes flavor but works. Adjust bake times with add-ins."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: At room temp in airtight container. Keep for 2-3 days. Freezing bags for a month. Thaw fully before slicing, prevents mess."
- "q: Can I swap ingredients? a: Chopped peanut butter cups instead of marshmallows work well. Experiment but control liquid ratios to keep texture right."
