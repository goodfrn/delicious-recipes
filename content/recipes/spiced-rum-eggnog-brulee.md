ingredients:
- "260 ml (1 1/8 cup) heavy cream 35%"
- "50 ml (3 tbsp) brown sugar"
- "1 ml (1/4 tsp) ground cinnamon"
- "1 pinch ground nutmeg"
- "1 small star anise"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) dark spiced rum"
- "4 egg yolks"
- "2 whole eggs"
- "white granulated sugar for topping"
instructions:
- "Position oven rack center. Preheat oven 160 °C (320 °F)."
- "Combine cream, half of brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, star anise, and rum in saucepan. Heat low about 6 minutes. Remove star anise."
- "In a medium bowl whisk egg yolks and whole eggs with remaining brown sugar until creamy."
- "Gradually pour warm cream mixture into eggs while whisking. Strain through fine sieve to remove solids."
- "Place clean dish towel or silicone mat in bottom of large roasting pan. Arrange 4 ramekins (about 125 ml each) inside. Pour custard evenly into ramekins."
- "Add hot water to pan up to halfway on ramekin sides. Roast custards 40 to 45 minutes. Should jiggle slightly but be mostly set. Do not let water boil."
- "Remove ramekins from water bath. Let cool to room temp. Chill minimum 4 hours or overnight."
- "Before serving, sprinkle a thin even layer of granulated sugar atop each custard. Use kitchen torch to caramelize sugar quickly until golden brown and crisp."
- "Serve immediately for the best textural contrast."
introduction: "Egg-rich custard with a hint of booze and warm spices. Cream, eggs, sugar. The slow bake in a water bath makes it silky, sets just right. The crackling, caramelized sugar top. Classic, but switched a few things. Star anise instead of clove, deeper brown sugar flavor, more eggs for creaminess. Chill enough or it'll wobble too much. Torch the sugar last-minute so it stays crisp. A little fuss, but worth it come holiday time. Boozy, warming, satisfying. Snack or dessert. Four servings, rich enough to share or savor alone."
ingredientsNote: "Reduced cream slightly to lighten bite. Brown sugar instead of part granulated for a deeper caramel taste. Star anise replaces clove, adding licorice undertones. More eggs for added custard body and richness. Rum increased slightly to boost aroma without overpowering. Granulated sugar reserved for brûlée topping only, preserving that crisp texture. Spices measured sparingly to avoid bitterness but still warm and fragrant. Ramekins sized for individual portions. Ingredients easy to find, pantry staples plus the star anise adds a creative tweak."
instructionsNote: "Heating cream mixture low keeps flavors intact, avoids scorching. Removing star anise after infusion prevents over-extraction. Whisking eggs gently with sugar ensures smooth custard base. Straining guards against lumps or cooked egg bits. Water bath prevents cracking, keeps gentle heat around ramekins. Oven temp lowered slightly to allow even cooking and avoid over-baking. Test with slight wobble to know custard is ready. Cooling completely crucial for proper set texture. Chilling minimum 4 hours recommended, overnight ideal. Caramelizing sugar right before serving retains crisp top layer. Use kitchen torch cautiously; too slow softens custard."
tips:
- "Use low heat when heating cream. Keeps flavors intact. Avoid burning. Star anise adds distinct flavor but can be omitted."
- "Whisk eggs gently with sugar. Prevents lumps. Smooth mixture results. Strain mixture for best texture. Critical step for smooth custard."
- "Keep everything at room temp before mixing. Ingredients blend better. Chill the finished custards a minimum of 4 hours."
- "Remember to allow custards to cool after water bath. Essential for them to set correctly. Jiggle test is key."
- "Caramelize sugar just before serving. Torch for crisp top. If lacking torch, broiler can work. But watch closely to avoid burning."
faq:
- "q: Can I substitute rum? a: Bourbon or brandy can work. Flavor changes though. Both add depth."
- "q: How long can I store custards? a: Store in fridge for 2-3 days. Best eaten fresh though. Crisp texture fades over time."
- "q: What if they don't set? a: Cool longer if too wobbly. Or reduce oven temp when cooking. Adjust timings."
- "q: Can I use dairy-free ingredients? a: Yes but texture changes. Look for heavy cream alternatives. Be cautious."
