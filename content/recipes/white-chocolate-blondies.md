title: "White Chocolate Pistachio Blondies"
slug: "white-chocolate-blondies"
description: "Subtle white chocolate fused with creamy ricotta and browned butter. Generous crunch of chopped toasted hazelnuts instead of pistachios. Balanced sugar cut with a pinch of fine sea salt. Moist, tender crumb that holds together but feels light on the bite. Extended baking time to coax a slightly fudgy center. A twist on traditional blondies that plays subtly with textures and flavors."
metaDescription: "White Chocolate Pistachio Blondies are rich yet light. Perfect balance of sweet chocolate and nutty flavor. Ideal for gatherings or a sweet treat."

ingredients:
- "140 g white chocolate, roughly chopped"
- "75 ml unsalted butter, browned and warm"
- "25 ml grapeseed oil"
- "150 ml whole milk ricotta, room temperature"
- "260 ml light brown sugar"
- "1.5 ml fine sea salt"
- "2 large eggs"
- "190 ml unbleached all-purpose flour"
- "120 ml toasted hazelnuts, chopped finely (optional)"
instructions:
- "Set oven rack mid-level and preheat oven to 175 C (350 F). Prepare 20 cm (8-inch) square pan with parchment paper edges folded over all sides. Grease remaining sides with a light smear of butter or oil. This ensures easy removal without tearing edges."
- "Melt white chocolate gently in a heatproof bowl either over simmering water or in 20-second bursts at medium power in microwave. Watch carefully. Stir until smooth. Add browned butter and stir in grapeseed oil until combined. The brown butter adds nutty depth—no skip here."
- "In a separate chilled bowl, beat ricotta, sugar, and salt with electric mixer. Keep speed moderate. You want a creamy, even mix—no lumps. The ricotta adds moisture and a soft tang."
- "Add eggs one at a time. Mix thoroughly but avoid overbeating. You want uniform incorporation but no excessive airiness—blondies are dense, not cakey."
- "At low mixer speed, fold in chocolate mixture. Follow immediately by sifted flour. Too much agitation here develops gluten making them tough—gentle but thorough is key."
- "If using nuts, fold in now with a flexible spatula. Hazelnuts add a warm, fragrant crunch. Pistachios will shift flavor tone—swap as you prefer but toast first for aroma and texture."
- "Pour batter into pan and smooth surface. Tap pan lightly on countertop to release trapped air bubbles."
- "Bake in preheated oven for 43 to 47 minutes. Look for edges set and slightly pulling from sides; center still a bit glossy with moist crumbs clinging to toothpick or skewer. Don’t bake till dry—textural contrast is vital."
- "Remove pan and cool fully on wire rack. Undercooked centers firm up as they cool. Use parchment edges to lift blondie slab gently out of the pan—watch for sticking spots if butter/oil layer was uneven."
- "Cut into 16 squares with a sharp, non-serrated knife. Let pieces rest at room temp before serving. Warm but not hot—ideal melting point for white chocolate with creamy ricotta backbone."
- "Serve as is or with a teaspoon of crème fraîche or lightly whipped cream. Storage: airtight container at room temp up to 3 days or frozen individually wrapped for up to 1 month."
introduction: "Think blondies that don’t hide behind heavy chocolate bitterness or stuck in typical chewy cracks. Swap mascarpone with ricotta—tangier, fresher, adds moist lift without weighing down. Instead of plain butter, brown it first for a richer, nutty aroma that mingles with white chocolate’s florally sweet notes. Pistachios get a break here; hazelnuts bring warm, toasty crunch. Oil added along with butter helps keep a tender, moist crumb while avoiding greasy edges. Long bake time, carefully watched. You want firm sides, delicate inside, toothpick with moist crumbs—not bone dry or gooey. Lift out with parchment hugs. Let rest, gets better, flavors settle. Cut now or later, temperature affects melt, flavor spread. Best warm with crème fraîche or a simple espresso shot. Not showy but confident in taste and texture. Clean, simple, precise."
ingredientsNote: "White chocolate needs gentle handling. Chop unevenly but don’t pulverize or you risk fragments that cook too fast, burn or harden. Browned butter isn’t optional—if skipped, lose nutty undertones. Ricotta temp matters—cold ricotta won’t blend well, causing lumps; room temp smooths faster, improves texture. Oil keeps crumb tender, makes for easy slicing; other oils okay but grapeseed neutral and high smoke point prevents flavor interference. Substitutions: mascarpone works but less tang; pistachios can be hazelnuts or toasted walnuts depending on preference, always roast nuts to boost flavor and crunch. Use unbleached flour only—bleached flour sacks moisture leading to dry crumb. Sugar? Light brown sugar gives mild molasses touch; white sugar less complex, dark brown maybe too heavy here. Salt balances everything—don’t skip or reduce too much."
instructionsNote: "Brown butter properly—watch closely or risk burnt notes dominating blondies. Melt chocolate gently; overheating leads to graininess, seizing. Combining ricotta and sugar first avoids dense lumps and prevents sugar granules from sinking to bottom. Eggs incorporated gradually for uniform mix—rushed blending traps too much air, turning crumb cakey. When folding flour, mix only enough to combine ingredients; overstirring develops gluten giving tough brownies. Nuts folded at the end—fold gently to avoid breaking nuts or deflating batter. Baking time indicators matter here: check edges slightly pulling from pan, center still glossy, moist crumbs on toothpick means done. Overbaking dries, underbaking too gooey. Cooling completely stabilizes shape; warm whites can soften too much, making cutting messy. Use sharp knife, wipe blade between cuts for clean squares. Serve at room temp or slightly warmed for best texture and flavor release. Store airtight to avoid drying out—foil wrap too tight can cause steam and sogginess."
tips:
- "Chop chocolate by hand, uneven pieces are fine. Avoid pulverizing; it can lead to fast cooking or burning. Watch butter while browning; still heat, stir often. If burnt, whole batch ruined."
- "Use room temp ricotta for better blending. Cold lumps sink. If lumpy, break up first. Mix sugar in thoroughly. Eggs should be added one at a time; must incorporate evenly. Too much air? Lean towards cakey."
- "Fold flour slowly, combine gently for dense texture. Too much stirring activates gluten. Nuts added last, fold carefully to keep whole pieces. Chopped too finely changes crunch. Toast first to perk flavor."
- "Ideal bake? Edges pull slightly from pan, center glossy. Toothpick test should show crumbs, not wet batter. Overbake if unsure; drying out ruins moisture. Undercooking? Cooling firms up center."
- "Lightly greased hands help with cutting; knife must be sharp. Wipe after each cut; prevents sticking. Store in airtight container. Can freeze; wrap well. Need quick thaw? Room temp works best."
faq:
- "q: Can I swap ricotta? a: Yes; mascarpone works as substitute but changes flavor. Don't skip brown butter though; essential for deep taste."
- "q: What if my blondies are too dry? a: Check baking time. Extra few minutes can dry out, flavor lost. If overmixed, gluten can toughen texture."
- "q: How to know they’re ready? a: Watch edges; should pull from sides. Toothpick test shows moist crumbs only. If underbaked, cooling helps."
- "q: How to store blondies? a: Room temp for up to 3 days in airtight. Fridge could dry them out. Freezing great for longer; wrap tightly for freshness."
