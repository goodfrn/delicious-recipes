ingredients:
- "1 medium onion minced"
- "3 cloves garlic minced"
- "45 ml olive oil"
- "200 ml arborio rice"
- "1 can 400 ml diced tomatoes, drained"
- "500 ml hot chicken stock"
- "2 cans 180g tuna in oil, drained and flaked"
- "150 ml all-purpose flour"
- "3 eggs beaten"
- "350 ml breadcrumbs"
- "Salt and black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Heat oil in saucepan over medium heat. Cook onion and garlic until softened. Season with salt and pepper. Add rice and stir to coat."
- "Stir in tomatoes and cook 2-3 minutes. Add warm broth in two additions, stirring often, waiting until absorbed before next. Cook until rice is soft, about 20-25 minutes total."
- "Mix in flaked tuna. Check seasoning. Transfer rice mixture to a dish. Cover with plastic wrap, cool then refrigerate at least 5 hours or overnight."
- "Set up dredging stations. Flour in one shallow plate, beaten eggs with salt and pepper in another, breadcrumbs pressed into the third."
- "Divide rice mixture into 16 equal portions (about 70 ml each). Shape each into a croquette. Coat each first in flour, then in egg, then breadcrumbs, pressing to adhere."
- "For fresh croquettes: Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Fry croquettes 3-4 minutes per side or until golden and crisp."
- "For frozen croquettes: Preheat oven to 230°C. Line baking tray with parchment, drizzle oil. Place frozen croquettes spaced apart. Bake 14 minutes, turn and bake 10 minutes more or until brown and cooked through."
introduction: "Rice cooked in tomato broth, salty tuna folded in. Cool it well, then press into small patties. Flour, egg, breadcrumbs. Brown crisp outside, soft inside. You can use the stove or oven. Cook fresh or freeze. The olive oil flavor tingles against savory fish and rice. Garlic and onion provide a mellow base. Simple ingredients folded into something textured, handheld, and hot. Great as snack or light meal. The little golden rounds hold their shape and flavor well when refrigerated or frozen."
ingredientsNote: "Using arborio rice adds creamy texture but holds firm. Choose canned diced tomatoes drained to avoid excess liquid. Tuna canned in oil adds richness; drain well to avoid sogginess. Three eggs bind but do not make mixture wet. Breadcrumbs must be fine and pressed firmly onto croquettes for crust. Flour is straightforward all-purpose, unbleached. Salt and pepper essential to bring out flavors. Olive oil for cooking, mild flavor. Chicken broth can be low sodium if preferred, taste before seasoning the rice. Garlic and onion add savor and depth but keep finely minced to avoid chunky bits in croquettes."
instructionsNote: "Start with softening onion and garlic gently so they don't brown. Stir arborio rice to coat grains. Tomatoes added early to integrate acidity. Add broth in parts to gradually cook risotto style to tender but not mushy rice. Cooling step is important—helps croquettes hold shape. Dredging stations arranged in order to cover evenly: flour, egg wash, breadcrumbs pressed. For frying, medium heat is key for golden crust without burning. Use just enough oil to brown, not deep fry. For baking, preheated hot oven crisps outside. Flip halfway for even color. Frozen croquettes bake longer to heat through. Let cool a few minutes after cooking before serving. Crisp on outside, moist inside."
tips:
- "Cool rice mixture is key. Refrigerate it properly. Helps form croquettes. Avoid mushy ones. Shape them tight. Standard size 70 ml each. Easier to cook uniform."
- "Use a nonstick skillet. Heat oil just enough. Prevents sticking. Frying should be medium heat. Not too hot or they'll burn. Flip croquettes carefully. Both sides golden."
- "Breadcrumbs must be fine. Press firmly on croquettes. Good crust crucial. Choose unseasoned ones. Let croquettes chill. Helps firm them up. Freezing is an option too."
- "Serve with dipping sauce. Aioli or a spicy option works well. Adds flavor contrast to croquettes. Make it fresh if possible. Balance texture of crispy and creamy."
- "Check seasoning at every stage. Rice should taste good. Salt and pepper matter. Adjust before cooling. Once they're fried, hard to fix flavor. Taste as you go."
faq:
- "q: How can I make these ahead? a: Prepare rice mixture day prior. Refrigerate overnight. Shape croquettes next day. Or freeze them for later. Cook from frozen directly."
- "q: What can I use instead of tuna? a: Try shredded chicken. Or cooked shrimp. Maybe even lentils for vegetarian. Each will change flavor though. Experiment with herbs too."
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Keep in airtight container. Fridge up to three days. For longer, freeze them. Reheat in oven or skillet. Crisp again while warming."
- "q: Why are my croquettes falling apart? a: Maybe rice not chilled enough. Or too much liquid in mixture. Ensure you shaped them tightly. Dredging helps hold them too."
