slug: "shrimp-corn-chowder"
description: "A hearty chowder with a lightly smoky bacon base, creamy potatoes, fresh corn, and Cajun-seasoned shrimp. Switched clams juice with seafood broth for depth. Slightly reduced starch and boosted fat for silkiness. Simmered potatoes to tender bite, added shrimp late to keep texture intact. A squeeze of lime at the end for brightness. Bacon reserved for crisp garnish adds punch. Easy to swap cream for coconut milk if dairy-free. Perfect for using leftover shrimp, avoid overcooking or it gets rubbery."

ingredients:
- "2 slices smoked pancetta, finely chopped"
- "15 ml olive oil"
- "1 medium shallot, finely chopped"
- "20 ml all-purpose flour"
- "240 ml seafood broth"
- "900 ml chicken broth"
- "400 ml diced Yukon gold potatoes, peeled"
- "400 ml fresh or frozen corn kernels"
- "400 ml peeled wild-caught shrimp seasoned with Cajun spices"
- "60 ml heavy cream"
- "zest and juice of half a lime"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Heat olive oil over medium heat in a heavy-bottomed pot. Add pancetta. Listen for gentle crackle. Render until fat releases and pieces turn crisp golden brown. Watch carefully though; pancetta can burn fast. Remove with slotted spoon, drain on paper towel. Set aside."
- "Add shallots to rendered fat in pot. Swirl around. Soften until translucent and fragrant, about 4 to 5 minutes. Avoid browning here; want sweetness, not bitterness."
- "Sprinkle flour evenly over shallots. Stir constantly for about 90 seconds; this cooks out raw flour flavor. Look for pale golden paste forming; no lumps allowed."
- "Slowly pour in seafood broth, whisking to combine smoothly. Bring to gentle boil, sharp bubbles forming, then steady simmer."
- "Add chicken broth, diced potatoes, and corn kernels. Push potatoes down a bit so they submerge. Simmer uncovered. Stir occasionally. Use gentle boil to avoid breaking potatoes up. Cook until potatoes yield easily to fork but still hold shape, about 22 minutes. Aroma should develop––corn sweetness mingling with pancetta fat smell."
- "Season shrimp with Cajun seasoning generously but balanced. Add to pot, carefully stir. Shrimp finish in 4 to 6 minutes; they turn pink and curl distinctly. Overcooked shrimp toughen and ruin mouthfeel."
- "Reduce heat, pour in cream and lime zest. Stir to unify. Lime juice added last, after removing from heat, brightens flavors without curdling cream."
- "Adjust salt and black pepper to taste. Remember broth and pancetta add saltiness; go slow."
- "Serve chowder hot, sprinkled with reserved pancetta. Add lime wedges on side for extra zing."
- "If thickening needed, blitz small portion of potatoes, add back gradually. Thin with broth if too thick. Keep texture chunky, not puree."
introduction: "Got leftover shrimp? Don’t toss ’em. Here’s a way to turn them into a chowder that sings. Pancetta replaces bacon for a cleaner smoke and salt punch. Shallots swap onions for softer aromatics. Corn and potatoes bulk it up, but keep ’em firm enough to bite through. The key, as always, is timing. Render fat slowly so it crisps without burning. When adding flour, the goal’s no lumps, just a light roux to thicken. Broths mixed for deeper base; clams went out for robust seafood stock. Shrimp go in last, else a rubbery disaster. Cream and fresh lime juice finish the bowl with richness and brightness. Serve with pancetta crunch. Try coconut cream if you want a dairy-free twist. The smell alone will have you hooked."
ingredientsNote: "Swapping pancetta for bacon cuts back on overpowering smokiness but keeps savor. Shallots add subtle sweetness not found in onions, dissolve better too. Seafood broth combines clam juice and chicken stock strength while calming fishiness. Yukon gold potatoes hold shape better than russets after simmering. Reduced flour slightly prevents gummy texture; chose 20 ml over 30 ml this round. Corn fresh or frozen is fine but fresh has brighter pop. Cajun shrimp seasoning simple: paprika, cayenne, garlic powder, black pepper, salt. Heavy cream can be subbed with coconut cream for dairy-free, or evaporated milk for lighter touch. Lime not lemon; acidity different and pairs with Cajun notes. Salt carefully; some broths saltier than others."
instructionsNote: "Start low and slow rendering pancetta; fat must render without burning solids or bitter notes emerge. Remove crisp bits to keep chowder clear, not cloudy with fat bits. Shallots sweat until soft but not color—they impart sweetness and mellow onion bite. Flour gets cooked through bare minimum; raw flour taste is a common flub. Whisk broth in gradually to avoid clumps lumps. Potatoes go in whole-diced, don’t stir constantly; too much agitation breaks them down, chowder turns pasty. Listen for gentle boil; vigorous bubbles break down ingredients too fast. Shrimp go in late; overcooked shrimp become rubbery and ruin bowl. Cream added off-heat keeps it from breaking. Lime juice added last keeps it bright without curdling. Adjust salt post-cream. Use slotted spoon pancetta as garnish rather than cooking in the soup; ensures crunch, prevents sogginess. Leftover chowder will thicken; add broth to thin on reheating. Blitzing a small amount of potato mash is good thickener without flour taste. Patience and texture awareness makes all the difference."
tips:
- "Start by rendering pancetta low and slow. Listen for that gentle crackle. If it burns, bitterness will creep in. Keep it moving."
- "Use Yukon gold potatoes. They hold shape better than russets. Diced whole; no need to stir too much. Agitation = pasty consistency."
- "Cajun seasoning for shrimp? Balance it out. Don’t drown in spices. Enough for kick but not overwhelming; texture matters."
- "For creamy finish, add heavy cream off heat. Hellooo no curdling. Lime juice after too, brings that fresh kick without drama."
- "If chowder thickens too much on reheating, splash in some broth. Blitz small potatoes for thickening if you run low on flour."
