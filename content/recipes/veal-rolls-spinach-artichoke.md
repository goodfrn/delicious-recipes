ingredients:
- "400 g fresh spinach washed and roughly chopped"
- "6 marinated artichoke hearts drained and finely chopped"
- "2 sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, chopped"
- "2 cloves garlic minced"
- "Olive oil for cooking"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
- "4 veal escalopes about 150 g each, pounded thin"
- "4 fresh mozzarella cubes about 1 cm, cut evenly"
- "Plain flour for dusting"
- "150 ml dry white wine"
- "450 ml chicken stock"
- "4 sprigs fresh thyme"
- "25 g unsalted butter"
- "Toothpicks or small skewers for securing"
instructions:
- "Steam spinach briefly, 90 seconds max until just wilted, drain carefully to avoid sogginess, squeeze dry, chop coarsely ; keep warm."
- "In a medium skillet, heat olive oil, toss garlic till fragrant but not browned, add artichokes and sun-dried tomatoes ; sautée 3 minutes. Combine with chopped spinach in bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Flavor should be robust but balanced."
- "Lay out veal escalopes, pat dry to ensure flour sticks. Spread a thin, even layer of veggie mix over each slice. Place one mozzarella cube in center. Roll edges tightly over cheese then roll together like cigar ; fix securely with toothpicks. Don’t overstuff or rolls won’t seal properly."
- "Lightly dust rolls in flour, shaking off excess to prevent gummy crust."
- "Heat skillet with olive oil over medium-high. Sear rolls 2–3 minutes per side till golden brown crust develops — audible sizzle key here. Remove and set aside. Do not overcrowd pan or steam develops; work in batches if necessary."
- "Deglaze pan with white wine scraping browned bits from bottom, let wine simmer down till viscous and reduced by half — smell should shift from sharp to mellow."
- "Add chicken stock and thyme sprigs to pan, stir to combine; return veal rolls to sauce. Cover, reduce heat to low, simmer gently 8–12 minutes until internal meat fibers relax but remain tender. Avoid boiling or toughening."
- "Remove rolls off heat onto plate; keep warm under tented foil."
- "Whisk cold butter into sauce off heat to emulsify and thicken. Sauce should coat back of spoon, taste and adjust salt or pepper as needed. Remove thyme sprigs before serving."
- "Slice rolls thick to showcase filling for presentation. Serve sauce spooned over. Optional sides: charred bell peppers or marinated eggplant add smoky counterpoint."
introduction: "Juicy veal rolled with an earthy sauté of spinach mixed with tender marinated artichokes and a surprising kick of sun-dried tomatoes for depth. Mozzarella cubes melted inside, giving way at every bite. The key lies in the execution — wilting spinach just right, seasoning properly, and especially searing the veal well to create a crisp outer texture before slow cooking in a fragrant white wine and thyme broth. Sauce reduction and butter finish builds flavor and mouthfeel. Simple ingredients transformed by timing and respect. Pitfalls? Overstuffed rolls bursting open, flabby spinach, underseasoned filling. Tools: a rolling pin for veal flattening helps, but firm hands work too. Spoonfuls of experience come through in timing and touch. Visual cues — golden crust, thickened sauce — act as your guide through each stage."
ingredientsNote: "Spinach must be fresh and drained well to avoid watery filling; frozen can work but drain drastically. Artichokes canned in water can substitute if oil-packed unavailable, but add 1 tsp olive oil for richness. The sun-dried tomatoes contribute acidity and chew — omit or replace with chopped roasted red peppers for sweeter contrast. Veal escalopes from the butcher that are thin and uniform cook evenly; otherwise, pounding ensures proper final texture and prevents toughness. Fresh mozzarella key for creamy contrast; alternatively burrata or even firm fresh goat cheese impart richness but alter flavor profile. Avoid pre-shredded cheeses prone to drying out or excessive moisture. Flour dusting essential to create browning and help sauce cling. Butter finishing not optional — adds velvety texture to a liquid sauce otherwise thin. Fresh herbs like thyme add subtle fragrance, rosemary too strong. White wine deglazes and lifts fond. Broth choice affects final taste and mouthfeel; homemade or low-sodium chicken stock preferred for clean taste."
instructionsNote: "Short steaming of spinach keeps bright color and prevents bitter flavor from overcooking. Squeeze spinach firmly to remove excess water or filling will become soggy and rolls hard to seal. Garlic adds aroma but never brown it or bitterness emerges; toss in at oil heating and stir constantly. Maintaining moderate heat during sautée avoids drying ingredients out yet encourages moisture evaporation for concentrated flavor. Rolling technique matters — roll from end closest to you tightly, tuck sides inward before rolling fully; secure with toothpicks or small skewers. Dust flour lightly to avoid lumps or gummy spots forming in pan; excess flour leads to burnt taste. Pan searing should create audible sizzle — if not, pan temperature too low and rolls will stew. Wine reduction stage removes harsh alcohol but do not over-reduce to dryness or sauce becomes bitter. Simmering covered just enough to cook through without inverting moisture loss. Allow veal to rest off heat to retain juices. Final butter whisking done off fire to prevent separation and preserve shine and creaminess in sauce. Adjust seasoning last — always taste sauce as it can intensify when reduced. Serve immediately after slicing rolls to preserve presentation and juiciness."
tips:
- "Searing key. Heat pan well. If not sizzling, temp low. Don't crowd. Guarantees good crust. Aim for golden, not stewed. Set aside, keep warm."
- "Rolling needs practice. Spread filling evenly, avoid overstuff. Secure tightly. Gaps lead to leaky rolls. Skills improve with repetitions. Use hands, patience."
- "Thyme adds subtle fragrance, but rosemary too strong for dish. Fresh herbs give best flavor. Dry if fresh unavailable. Adjust flavors with care."
- "Wine reduction critical. Too little leads to harshness. Too much makes it dry. Watch for viscous texture, aroma shifts to mellow. Smell tells all."
- "Butter enriches sauce; don't skip. Emulsifying off heat retains shine. Whisk in until thick. Sauce should cling, coat spoon, flavor builds."
faq:
- "q: How to fix soggy filling? a: Drain spinach well. Squeeze excess water. Avoid overcooking. Fridge for prep helps. Use firm hands."
- "q: Can I use different cheese? a: Yes, burrata or goat cheese work. Different flavors, but keep creaminess. Avoid pre-shredded. They dry quickly."
- "q: Why did my rolls fall apart? a: Common issue with overstuffing. Roll tightly; secure with toothpicks. Practice rolling, holding filling inside."
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Cool quickly, refrigerate in airtight container. Consume within 2-3 days. Reheat gently, too hot risks drying."
