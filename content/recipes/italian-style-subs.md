ingredients:
- "=== Salad ==="
- "28 g (1/3 cup) finely grated fresh Parmesan cheese"
- "60 ml (4 tbsp) extra virgin olive oil"
- "15 ml (3 tsp) fresh lemon juice"
- "3 ml (3/4 tsp) dried oregano"
- "2 ml (1/2 tsp) ground fennel seeds"
- "1 large head romaine lettuce, shredded"
- "=== Sandwiches ==="
- "2 submarine rolls, 20 cm (8 inches) long"

- "1 package (200 g) assorted deli meats"
- "6 slices aged provolone cheese"
- "250 ml (1 cup) jarred roasted vegetable antipasto, drained"
- "Fresh basil leaves for garnish"
instructions:
- "=== Salad ==="
- "Toss Parmesan, oil, lemon juice, oregano, ground fennel seeds together in a medium bowl. Season lightly with salt and black pepper."
- "Add shredded romaine. Mix thoroughly to coat leaves. Taste. Adjust seasoning—more salt, lemon, or oil as needed."
- "=== Sandwiches ==="
- "Cut submarine rolls longwise but not all the way through—they should hinge open."
- "Spread mayonnaise inside each roll as preferred."
- "Layer salad mixture over bottom half of each roll, pressing gently."
- "Add deli meats evenly on top of salad."
- "Place provolone slices over meats."
- "Scatter drained roasted vegetables antipasto atop cheese."
- "Close rolls and slice each into halves."
- "Garnish with fresh basil leaves. Serve immediately."
introduction: "Deli cold cuts mixed with sharp cheese and vinegary veggies. Romaine lettuce tossed in a tangy, spiced Parmesan dressing. Layers in sub rolls providing crunch, cream, and herb aromas. No cooking needed, just assemble and munch. A twist on classic Italian subs with ground fennel spice and fresh lemon for brightness. Substitute jarred antipasto for fresh roasted vegetables to save time, yet still tangy and sweet. Meats changed with coppa and speck instead of standard salami. Simple, grab-and-go lunch, packed with flavor and texture contrast. Fennel gives a slight anise note, oregano adds warmth."
ingredientsNote: "Adjust Parmesan amount up or down for richer or lighter cheese flavor; shredded romaine works best for texture, not too watery. Swapping fennel seeds with toasted cumin seeds can give a smokier twist. Use aged provolone here, but mozzarella or fontina are good alternatives if milder cheese is preferred. Mayonnaise can be replaced with pesto spread for herbiness. Changing deli meats to include prosciutto and soppressata keeps it Italian but varies taste. Drain the antipasto thoroughly so sandwiches don’t get soggy—jarred or homemade both work. Rolls should be fresh with a slight crust, soft inside. Basil garnish is optional, adds freshness and a pop of color."
instructionsNote: "Mix dressing ingredients first to let flavors marry—wait at least 5 minutes before tossing salad for better depth. When finely grating Parmesan, avoid powdery bits for texture. Slice rolls carefully to keep them hinged, so fillings don’t spill. Layer salad first, then cold cuts, then cheese, finally antipasto to prevent sogginess but keep taste balance. Serve sandwiches immediately to keep crispness—lettuce wilts with standing. If preparing ahead, keep salad and bread separate until serving, assemble last minute. For extra flavor, toast bread lightly before assembly, but optional. Slice subs on a diagonal for easier eating and presentation. Use a sharp serrated knife for clean cuts without mashing bread."
tips:
- "Consider a mix of meats for sub. Prosciutto, speck, and capicola create depth. Combine with aged provolone for flavor contrast. Don't forget to drain roasted vegetables well. Extra moisture makes everything soggy. Use fresh, crusty rolls for ideal texture and bite. Layering is crucial. Salad first, then meats, cheese topping last. This order helps keep the sandwich balanced—avoiding sogginess."
- "Adjusting seasoning can enhance flavors. More lemon juice adds brightness. A touch of salt balances acidity really well. Fennel gives a hint of sweetness, try more or less to suit taste. For a creamy twist, mix mayonnaise with a hint of Dijon mustard. It adds tang. And basil garnish is a fresh touch. Not needed but brightens the appearance."
- "If making ahead, prepare the salad separately from bread. Keeps everything fresh until served. Let salad marinate. Flavors develop nicely. Prepare antipasto too, drain well. Soggy buns ruin sandwiches. If time allows, toast rolls for added texture. Just lightly to avoid overpowering flavors. It warms ingredients subtly. Slice sandwiches on a diagonal. Makes for easier handling."
- "Keep your salad crisp. Shredded romaine works well. Thicker leaves might make bites unwieldy. A tip—grate Parmesan finely. Avoid powder for better texture in salad. Clean knife is vital for cutting subs. Serrated knife cuts without crushing. An easier experience while eating. Don’t pack too tightly. Air helps enjoy flavors. Aim for even layers, not overwhelming. That’s the key."
faq:
- "q: How do I customize deli meats a: Mix varieties for additional flavor. Prosciutto, capicola, or salami all work. Balance saltiness with milder cheese. Swap ingredients to meet preferences. Change antipasto for lighter fresh veggies."
- "q: What's the best way to store leftovers a: Keep sandwiches in airtight containers. Best for a day or two. Don't freeze as bread quality suffers. Store salads separately too. Combine before eating. Enjoy freshness every time."
- "q: Can I make this vegan a: Yes, use plant-based cheeses. Substitute deli meats for marinated tofu or smoked tempeh. Use pickled veggies for tang. Keep dressing plant-based to match flavors. Don't compromise on taste."
- "q: What if I don’t like fennel a: Ground cumin offers smokiness. Use thyme or basil for a warmer touch. Swap dried herbs. Customize to suit palates. Experiment with what's on hand, results can surprise."
