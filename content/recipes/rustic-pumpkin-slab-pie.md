slug: "rustic-pumpkin-slab-pie"
description: "Double refrigerated pastry sheets merged into one large slab crust baked in a quarter sheet pan. Pumpkin puree combined with eggs and sweet cream for deeper flavor and silky texture. Baked till crust is golden brown and filling slightly quivers. Rested in the oven with door ajar to finish setting without cracking. Cut into a dozen servings. Extra cinnamon swapped with warm ginger and a hint of allspice for spice complexity. Evaporated milk replaced with heavy cream for richness. Tips on handling dough chill time, flour use, and recognizing doneness included."

ingredients:
- "2 refrigerated pie crusts; thawed but kept in plastic sleeves"
- "1 1/4 cups pumpkin puree; canned or fresh cooked"
- "3 large eggs"
- "1 cup heavy cream instead of evaporated milk"
- "1/2 cup dark brown sugar"
- "1 teaspoon ground ginger replacing cinnamon"
- "1/2 teaspoon ground allspice added for warmth"
- "1/2 teaspoon salt"
- "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Chill pie crusts in fridge until just relaxed but still cold; keep in plastic to avoid drying. Flour work surface lightly to prevent sticking but keep minimal flour to maintain flakiness. Stack crusts and roll out simultaneously to about 17x14 inches rectangle. Larger than pan to allow rolling edges inward."
- "Transfer dough gently onto a quarter sheet pan. Press dough into corners, no tugging. Let excess hang over edges–important for rolling edges later. Rolling edge inward builds a stable rim that prevents filling spillover and creates thicker crust rim for texture contrast."
- "Fold hanging edges toward center evenly around perimeter. Press firmly but don’t tear dough. Cover with kitchen towel or plastic wrap and chill for 45-60 minutes. The rest solidifies butter in dough and makes rolling edge crispier after baking."
- "Meanwhile, prep filling–whisk pumpkin puree, brown sugar, eggs, cream, ginger, allspice, salt, and pepper by hand. Avoid electric mixers; too much air makes cracks. Filling should be uniform, creamy but not frothy."
- "Remove crust from fridge, poke bottom crust with fork 8-10 times to reduce bubbles and prevent sogginess. Pour filling into shell slowly, stop once filling is level with crust edge - no overflow. Spreading unevenly leads to overcooked edges or underdone middle."
- "Bake at 350°F (175°C) for roughly 55 minutes. Look for edges turning golden brown, crust surface slightly puffed and firm. Filling jiggles slightly in center but no liquid pooling. If center is too loose and crust browns fast, tent pan with foil to prevent burning."
- "Once time lapses, turn oven off completely. Crack oven door open slightly using a wooden spoon handle or folded towel for 10-15 minutes to cool gradually. Helps filling set without cracking or sudden shrinkage."
- "Allow slab pie to cool for 3-4 hours on wire rack. Cutting too soon causes filling to crumble or run. Refrigerate leftovers tightly covered or rewrap sheet pan with foil if used for storage. Serve chilled or room temperature; flavors deepen after a day."
- "Common pitfalls: overworking dough will cause toughness. Under-chilling dough causes shrinkage and loss of shape. Use fresh spices for best aroma and depth. Brown sugar imparts slight molasses note; substitute with white sugar plus 1 tsp molasses only if needed."
- "Efficiency hacks: reuse rolling pin to shape crust edges. Use a silicone baking mat under dough for easy transfer. If dough cracks during rolling, patch with minimal water and flour mix; prevent tearing to save time."
- "Substitutions summary: heavy cream replaces evaporated milk for creamier custard. Ground ginger and allspice swap cinnamon to shift flavor profile but maintain warmth."
- "Slice into bars with sharp serrated knife for clean edges. Avoid pressing too hard to maintain custard integrity."
introduction: "Pumpkin filling with custard base that’s carefully balanced for texture – not too wet, never dry. Rolling refrigerated pie crusts into a single slab. Big rectangular pan for easy portioning – no fiddly individual pies. Chill dough edges folded inward to keep structure. Filling—eggs and cream instead of evaporated milk—controls richness and density, forgiving for novice bakers. Bake slow at moderate temp till crust deepens color and filling sets with slight wiggle. Leave in cooling oven for gradual set and to cut cracking risk. Patience is key. Spice swap with ginger and allspice in place of cinnamon for a less expected but familiar warmth. Simple, practical, sturdy pumpkin pie converted to slab style for communal eating. No fluff, just reliable results."
ingredientsNote: "Refrigerated pie crusts are a time saver but handle with care; cold butter layers mean flaky crust but warm dough tears easily. Keeping crust chilled prevents shrinkage in oven. Using heavy cream adds fat content and richness compared to evaporated milk, yielding silkier mouthfeel. Brown sugar brings moisture and depth, molasses notes more complex than plain white sugar. Ground ginger and allspice replace cinnamon for a spicier aroma, closer to old-fashioned pumpkin desserts. Salt balances sweetness and enhances flavor layering. Avoid electric mixing of filling to prevent air bubbles, which cause cracks and holes after baking. If fresh spices not available, pre-ground staples suffice but freshness elevates aroma and taste. If crust cracks during rolling, patch carefully with little water to maintain integrity."
instructionsNote: "Thaw pie crusts fully but keep wrapped until ready to roll; dough relaxes without drying out. Minimal flour on the surface prevents dough from sticking or tearing during rolling. Rolling two crusts stacked speeds up process and creates a thicker, sturdier slab crust. Pressing dough into pan corners avoids air pockets which can cause uneven bake or soggy spots. Rolling edge inward provides a natural barrier against bubbling filling spillover and creates a pleasing rustic lip. Chilling after shaping firms dough, so it maintains shape during baking. Mixing filling by hand preserves smooth texture; electric mixers incorporate bubbles causing cracks after baking. Baking at 350°F allows even cooking of thick custard without burning crust. Visual cues—golden crust, wobbly but not liquid center—signal doneness better than strict timers. Cooling in oven with door cracked prevents cracks by slow setting. Long wire rack cooling avoids condensation and soggy bottom. Cutting after full cool ensures clean slices and intact filling."
tips:
- "Keep pie crusts cool. Avoid warming up. Relax dough in fridge. Poking holes in bottom keeps crust crisp. Just avoid too much flour. Light touch only."
- "Handling dough matters. Fold edges inward creates crust lip. Stops spills. Firm but gentle pressure keeps it intact. Avoid tearing while shaping."
- "Watch your filling. Whisk by hand to avoid air bubbles. Air makes cracks in custard. Uniform texture key. Creamy over frothy works best."
- "Baking notices. Golden edges mean success. Jiggle center shows doneness. If too loose but crust browning too fast, foil tent helps prevent burning."
- "Cooling isn’t optional. Let pie rest in warm oven cracked open. Avoid sudden temp shifts. Patience means less cracking. Keep covered for storage."
faq:
- "q: Can I use a different crust? a: Yep, homemade works. Just chill dough well. Trouble with store-bought? Watch for shrinkage."
- "q: How to know when pie is done? a: Look for golden crust. Firm edges, slight jiggle still ok. If unsure, poke a knife. Check center."
- "q: Storage life? a: 3-4 days in fridge. Cover tightly. Want longer? Freeze slices. Be mindful about thawing for best texture."
- "q: What if filling cracks? a: Too much air when mixing. Avoid electric whisks. Helps stabilize. Note: Overbaking is another reason."
