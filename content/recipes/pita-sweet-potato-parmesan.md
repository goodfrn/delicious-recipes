ingredients:
- "=== Sweet Potatoes ==="
- "500 g (3 1/2 cups) small sweet potatoes peeled and cubed"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) extra virgin olive oil"
- "20 g (1/4 cup) pecorino romano grated"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) toasted sesame seeds"
- "=== Red Cabbage ==="
- "140 g (1 2/3 cups) thinly sliced red cabbage"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) fresh lemon juice"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) mild chili paste"
- "=== Tahini Mayonnaise ==="
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) mayonnaise"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) tahini at room temperature"
- "10 ml (2 tsp) water"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) lemon juice"
- "3 ml (3/4 tsp) mild chili paste"
- "=== Garnish ==="
- "4 pita breads lightly warmed"
- "80 g (2/3 cup) haricots verts blanched and sliced into 1/2 cm pieces"
- "Fresh basil leaves torn"
instructions:
- "=== Sweet Potatoes ==="
- "Heat oven to 215°C (420°F). Middle rack. Line baking sheet with parchment."
- "Toss sweet potato cubes with olive oil until slick but not oily. Add grated pecorino romano and sesame seeds. Stir gently to coat evenly. Salt and pepper liberally; these big flavors need seasoning."
- "Spread potatoes in single layer. Roast 17 to 20 minutes until edges crisp and color deepens to golden brown. Flip halfway. Should have some charred spots but tender inside, test with fork – creamy but not falling apart."
- "=== Red Cabbage ==="
- "In bowl, combine thinly shredded red cabbage, lemon juice, and mild chili paste. Salt with a pinch. Toss and let macerate around 15 minutes. Bright acidity softens cabbage slightly while preserving crunch."
- "=== Tahini Mayonnaise ==="
- "Whisk mayo, tahini, water, lemon juice, and chili paste until smooth. Adjust water to loosen if thick. Balance acidity and heat — mayo tames tahini bitterness and chili adds dimension."
- "=== Assembly ==="
- "Blanch haricots verts until vibrant green and just tender. Shock in cold water immediately to keep snap and color. Drain well."
- "Spread each pita bread with a generous smear of tahini mayo."
- "Layer with red cabbage, then add roasted sweet potatoes carefully to avoid smashing."
- "Sprinkle haricots verts and torn basil leaves over the top. Basil adds herbal brightness against earthy potato and spicy mayo."
- "Roll pita tightly. Serve warm or room temp. Crispy edges from roasting will soften inside pita but keep body."
- "=== Tips and Substitutions ==="
- "Pecorino romano subs well for parmigiano reggiano, sharper and saltier but works with sesame nicely."
- "For chili paste, use sriracha or sambal oelek if needed – adjust quantity to taste."
- "If no tahini, use plain yogurt for lighter sauce."
- "Sweet potatoes vary—start checking tenderness at 15 minutes. Don’t overcrowd pan to avoid steaming."
- "Pita can be toasted or warmed in skillet. Too hot and it cracks, so warm gently."
- "You can add crunchy nuts like toasted pumpkin seeds if no nut allergy for texture twist."
- "Keep cabbage fresh, if macerated too long it gets soggy."
- "Hint of lemon in both cabbage and sauce brightens and balances richness."
introduction: "Sticky hands from roasting sweet potatoes. The sizzle and hiss as cubes hit hot oil and parchment, edges caramelizing to that leathery brown crust you want – no mush here. Aromas snap: sesame toasty, cheese sharp, chili hanging in air with lemony zing from cabbage. Tahini mayonnaise cuts creamy, smooth but with a fiery coursing underneath. Haricots verts offer green crunch snap. Basil leaves torn with fingers, herbal pops against sweetness. Pita warm, soft, almost pillowing these layers tighter. No fluff, just right technique: roast well, season hard, keep cabbage crisp and sauce balanced. Swap ingredients if fridge is short — pecorino instead of parmesan, switch chili paste to sriracha. Master texture, watch doneness, rely on smell and touch over timer. Gets messy, gestures with hands, but worth every smudge. That’s kitchen wisdom – controlling chaos to get reliable results."
ingredientsNote: "Sweet potatoes selected small, uniform size for even roasting. Peeling optional depending on skin thickness but helps caramelize edges. Pecorino romano instead of parm adds salt and bite paired with sesame seeds, which you toast gently before to awaken oils – skip to avoid bitterness. Chili paste mild to not overpower, balance with acidity from lemon juice; green beans blanched briefly for snap without mush, sliced for easier layering inside pita. Tahini warmed slightly mixes smoother, sometimes thick so adding small water increments prevents clumps. Mayonnaise base smoothens heat and bitter tahini. Pita breads fresh, slightly warmed to soften but not so hot they crack or turn brittle. Basil fresh, torn not chopped to release aroma without bruising. Sub out tahini for Greek yogurt or add a teaspoon of maple syrup in sauce for subtle hint of sweetness if you want twist. Use sambal oelek instead chili for smokier tone."
instructionsNote: "Heat oven well before roasting to ensure immediate surface caramelization. Use parchment lined pan to avoid sticking and ease flipping. Toss gently after 15 min roast to keep edges crisp and color even. Sweet potatoes done when pierced with fork and edges show golden. Avoid overcrowding to keep roasting dry; otherwise they steam and get soggy. For cabbage, fine slicing helps quick maceration, toss with lemon and chili paste then wait—colors brighten, bite softens but stays crunchy. Combine mayonnaise and tahini with slow whisking, adjust texture with water—not too runny or sauce won’t adhere. Blanch beans rapidly in boiling salted water, shock immediately, dries quickly on kitchen towel to avoid watery sandwich. Layering matters: spread mayo first to keep filling from drying pita. Handle pea-size sweet potatoes to avoid breaking apart in sandwich. Roll pita tightly to keep filling compact; slice in half to serve. Store leftover roasted potatoes and cabbage separated for best freshness."
tips:
- "Check sweet potatoes at 15 minutes. Avoid mush. Crisp edges desired. Remove from oven with golden color. Don't overcrowd to keep roasting dry."
- "Layer components with care. Switch ingredients if needed. Substitute pecorino with parmesan. Use yogurt if tahini not available. Adjust chili paste to taste."
- "For haricots verts, blanch quick. Keep color. Shock in cold water. Bad color? Undercook a bit. Drain well but avoid over-watering pita."
- "Fresh pita needs warmth but not too hot. Too hot cracks pita. Aim for flexibility. Toast lightly for crunch, avoid brittle. Good balance in texture."
- "Fine slice for cabbage quick marination. Bright color, crunch intact. Skip the soaking too long. Acidic zing balances sweetness of potatoes nicely."
faq:
- "q: How to check for sweet potato doneness? a: Fork test. Should be tender inside. Watch edges. Golden, some charring is good."
- "q: What's the best way to store leftovers? a: Keep potatoes and cabbage separate. Refrigerate airtight. Creaminess on potatoes might fade."
- "q: Alternatives for tahini? a: Use plain yogurt or Greek yogurt. Add maple for sweetness if preferred. And consistency? Adjust water."
- "q: Cabbage too soft after marinating? a: Limit time, 15 min max. Crunch is key. Too long? Texture lost. Start again fresh."
