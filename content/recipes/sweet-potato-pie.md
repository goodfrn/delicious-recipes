ingredients:
- "1 can (29 oz) yams, drained and rinsed"
- "3/4 cup brown sugar, packed"
- "1 tablespoon ground cinnamon"
- "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1 cup canned coconut milk, well shaken"
- "3 large eggs"
- "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract"
- "1/2 cup Greek yogurt"
- "1 unbaked 9-inch pie crust"

- "1 cup chilled coconut cream (solid part from can)"
- "2 tablespoons pure maple syrup"
- "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon"
instructions:
- "=== Pie ==="
- "Oven racks low, bottom third. Preheat oven to 430°F for strong initial bake; a blast to start cooking filling edges quickly and set crust. Sizzle hint in air means ready."
- "Drain yams well, pat dry to reduce water. Mash in large bowl using potato masher or fork. Lumpy acceptable, no puree necessary."
- "Add brown sugar, cinnamon, salt. Stir using flexible spatula. Mix until uniform but don’t overwork; over mixing activates starch, tough pies."
- "Pour in coconut milk, add eggs one at a time, followed by vanilla and Greek yogurt. Mix gently. Mixture will look loose, almost soupy. That’s right. The dairy and eggs thicken during baking, patience."
- "Pour filling into crust carefully; fill slightly below rim to allow expansion. Pie might not use all filling, save excess for a breakfast custard or discard if unsure."
- "Place pie on rimmed baking sheet to catch drips, easy cleanup tips. Slide into hot oven immediately. Bake 15 minutes – look for edges to firm and bubble slightly, crust edge golden brown."
- "Reduce heat to 345°F. Continue baking 35 to 55 minutes. Jostle carefully – pie center should barely jiggle like a gelatin dessert but not liquid. Watch edges for small cracks; tiny fissures near crust okay but stop if large cracks or browning too fast happens. Oven can dry pie out."
- "Turn oven off, crack door open an inch. Leave pie inside 1½ to 2 hours. This slow cool prevents cracking and sets texture. Patience beats rushing every time."
- "Transfer pie to cooling rack. After room temperature, wrap loosely in plastic or foil. Refrigerate minimum 3 hours; overnight better. Chilled pie slices cleaner, easier."
- "Serve with whipped coconut cream on top. Spoon dollop generously; cream thick, fluffy, slightly sweet, balanced cinnamon warmth."
- ""
- "=== Whipped Coconut Cream ==="
- "Use chilled coconut cream only — solid from can, leave liquid part aside or save for smoothies. Cold bowl and beaters speed whipping."
- "Beat cream with electric mixer fitted with whisk attachment until soft peaks start about 2 minutes."
- "Add maple syrup and cinnamon carefully. Continue whipping 1-2 minutes until stiff peaks form. Don’t overbeat; breaks down airiness turning grainy."
- "Spoon directly onto pie slices just before serving. Won’t hold shape three days so make fresh or same day preparation."
- "Store leftover cream tightly covered in refrigerator."
introduction: "Diving into sweet potato pie but tired of the usual? Swap in coconut milk and Greek yogurt instead of evaporated milk and sour cream for a silkier texture and a subtle tropical hint that cuts sweetness without undermining richness. Brown sugar and ground cinnamon replace the pumpkin pie spice for warmth and heft without overpowering. Start baking hot and fast to seal edges and crust, then lower temperature so the filling sets slowly and evenly without cracking apart. Learning when the center jiggles just right is the key over any fixed timer; feels like a gentle wobble but not runny. Corners can crack near crust—that’s normal, but big fissures mean overbake. End with slow cool down inside same oven with the door cracked to prevent shrinks or cracks while firming. Coconut cream whipped with maple syrup and cinnamon replaces traditional whipped cream with an earthy sweetness and cozy spice. Not just a pie but a consultation in timing, textures, and tweaks — change ingredients smartly, avoid overmixing or watery filling, and you’ll nail it."
ingredientsNote: "Using canned yams? Drain and rinse to remove excess syrup that dilutes flavor and adds unwanted moisture. Brown sugar gives deeper caramel tones compared to white. Cinnamon chosen over pumpkin spice—pumpkin spice blends vary and can introduce clove or nutmeg flavors that overpower yams. Coconut milk sub for evaporated milk adds fat and smoothness, critical for silky filling, plus dairy-free option if needed. Greek yogurt instead of sour cream stabilizes without tangy sharpness, also boosts protein and thickness. Pie crust unbaked is easier here since filling bakes thoroughly; refrigerate crust if purchased to minimize shrinkage during blind bake substitute. Whipped cream swapped for coconut cream plus maple syrup, ideal for those avoiding dairy while adding pleasant sweetness and spice. Common challenge: watery filling often from excess liquid or overmixing—control mashed yam moisture, and mix gently."
instructionsNote: "Preheating high is critical to rapidly set crust edges so they stay crisp throughout bake; without, soggy crust common. Mashing yams loosely keeps texture interesting and filling sets better than pureed. When mixing wet ingredients, add eggs gradually; eggs are main binders, too many broken yolks or heavy beating makes filling tough and rubbery. Pour slowly to avoid crust overflow which causes uneven baking and messes. Baking in rimmed pan catches spills—side note worthy if oven cleaning is a nightmare. Rely on jiggle test rather than timer; overbaking dries filling, visible cracks signal overdone pie. Cooling pie inside oven with door ajar is crucial to equalize temperature; skipping this causes shrink and cracks. Refrigerate minimum 3 hours for firm slices and flavor meld. For coconut cream, chill entire can overnight, scoop solids, whip cold, sweeten last to keep volume. Don’t overwhip coconut cream; it turns greasy. Serve immediately with freshly whipped topping to maintain texture."
tips:
- "Preheat oven to 430°F; sets pie edges. Avoid soggy crust. Cool in oven with door cracked to prevent shrinkage. Pie crust choice matters. If store bought, refrigerate."
- "Mash yams. Don’t overmix—keep lumps. They'll add texture. Too much mixing activates starch, get a tougher filling. Pat yams dry; excess moisture ruins texture."
- "When pouring filling into crust, do it carefully. Too full leads to spills. Might happen, but avoid it. Use a baking sheet to catch drips if necessary."
- "Bread with crust-less edges? Watch baking times—seeing jiggle matters more than clocks. If edges crack, that's fine but too much movement? Problem. Could be overbaked."
- "Whip coconut cream in a chilled bowl. Use only solid part from can. Add maple syrup and gingerly mix. Don't over-beat or it'll get grainy. Fresh is best."
faq:
- "q: What's best way to ensure creamy filling? a: Pat yams dry, don't overmix. Gentle mixing keeps air in. If you see bubbles, you're good but watch edges."
- "q: How can I prevent watery filling? a: Drain well. Excess moisture leads to sloppiness. If filling seems too soupy before baking, let it sit a bit."
- "q: What's the best storage method? a: Keep pie loosely wrapped in fridge; first few days best for texture. Coconut cream's no good after three days."
- "q: What if my pie cracks? a: Early crack? It’s okay, happens sometimes. Too many cracks? Likely overbaked. Adjust temperature next time to avoid that."
