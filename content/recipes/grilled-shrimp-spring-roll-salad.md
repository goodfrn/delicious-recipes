ingredients:
- "Vinaigrette"
- "50 ml reduced-sodium soy sauce"
- "25 ml brown sugar"
- "25 ml toasted sesame oil"
- "5 ml chili garlic sauce (or fresh minced chili)"
- "5 ml grated fresh ginger"
- "Zest and juice of 1 lime"
- "Shrimp and salad"
- "400 g medium shrimp (16-24 count), peeled, tails on"
- "1 small red onion, thinly sliced"
- "200 g rice vermicelli"
- "150 g butter lettuce, shredded"
- "2 Persian cucumbers, sliced thin"
- "15 g (1/3 cup) fresh mint leaves"
- "1 lime, quartered"
instructions:
- "== Vinaigrette =="
- "Whisk soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, chili sauce, ginger, lime zest, and juice in a large bowl. Sugar should dissolve fully. Set aside."
- "== Prep Vermicelli =="
- "Boil a large pot of water. Add vermicelli, stir gently. Cook 2-3 minutes until soft but still slightly chewy. Drain. Rinse under cold water to stop cooking; drain well. Toss immediately in half the vinaigrette to prevent sticking."
- "== Grill Shrimp + Onion =="
- "Heat barbecue to high. Place a grill-safe wok or cast-iron pan on grill. When smoky hot, toss shrimp and onion with 3 tbsp vinaigrette, coat well but not swimming. Spread in single layer. Grill, stirring occasionally, about 4-6 minutes until shrimp turn opaque, pink with grill marks. Onions soften and char. Shrimp should spring back when pressed, not feel rubbery. Remove promptly to avoid overcooking."
- "== Assemble Salad =="
- "Add shredded butter lettuce, cucumbers, and half the mint into bowl with vermicelli; toss gently with remaining vinaigrette. Taste and adjust acidity or heat; lime juice or chili if needed."
- "Arrange salad on serving plate. Top with shrimp and grilled onions. Scatter remaining mint leaves on top. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing."
- "== Notes =="
- "Tofu or firm white fish works if shrimp unavailable. If no barbecue, use high heat skillet or broiler; adjust time, watch closely. Vermicelli varies—don’t overcook; they should have bite, not mush."
- "If dressing seems too salty, add a splash of water or extra lime juice. Mint leaves can be swapped with cilantro, basil for different fragrance. Sesame oil is key; toasted variety adds nuttiness; don’t skip."
- "Cleanup tip: soaking wok or pan immediately after grilling makes char easier to remove."
introduction: "Shrimp grilled with a quick char, smoky and sizzling over intense heat. The vermicelli ready in minutes, tender yet firm, slippery on the tongue. Crunch of cucumber, sharp burst from red onion, cool freshness from mint. The sauce? Balanced acid and umami clash, sweetness cuts through, heat lingers lightly. This isn’t complicated—it's about timing, texture, and sharp attention. Grill the shrimp right; don’t crowd the pan or they steam and get rubbery. Vermicelli—don’t eyeball them soggy. Rinse them immediately after boiling. Toss in dressing warm but not hot, so noodles don’t turn mush. The salad? Serve it just after tossing so mint keeps its shine and fragrance, lime wedges make the difference. Twists on the classics keep meals interesting."
ingredientsNote: "Reduced-sodium soy sauce controls saltiness, key for balance here; substitute with tamari for gluten-intolerant. Brown sugar replaced 30% here with honey or maple syrup for deeper flavor but adjust carefully as these are sweeter. Toasted sesame oil packs depth, regular sesame oil lacks the toasty note needed. Sambal oelek swapped with chili garlic sauce in a smaller quantity; fresh minced chili is an alternative but mind the heat. Shrimp reduced to 400 g, adjusting ratio with noodles for better mouthfeel; smaller shrimp work well but cook faster—watch carefully. Butter lettuce replaced iceberg for softer leaf structure, more tender contrast with the crunch of cucumber. Persian cucumbers instead of Lebanese cucumbers because of availability and thinner skin. Mint increased slightly for a fresher burst. Lime zest in dressing critical for complexity, don’t skip. Onion sliced thin to avoid overwhelming texture and flavor."
instructionsNote: "Begin with the vinaigrette—never rush dissolving sugar in cold liquids. Resting it melds flavors. Vermicelli timing is crucial; overcook and it turns sticky, tough to fix. Rinse immediately—helps cool and stop cooking. Grilling shrimp is a sensory game—look for firm flesh that bounces back, color change from translucent grey to solid pinkish-white. Onions char nicely, adding bite and aroma, don’t let them blacken completely. Toss shrimp and onion with part of the vinaigrette before grilling so they caramelize but avoid drowning them; the sugars are enough to char nicely without burning. Assembly fast—lettuce can wilt if doused too early with dressing. Final garnish with mint last-minute to keep bright green color and fragrance. Lime wedges served, encourage guests to squeeze freshly; acids brighten and lift heavy textures. Swap components for allergies: nuts omitted, coconut aminos instead of soy for soy allergy but expect taste shift. Emphasize temperature control—grill should be hot but not smoky enough to burn. Tools: wok on grill for even heat, or cast iron pan."
tips:
- "Timing's everything with shrimp. High heat, quick grilling. Don't overcook—watch for opaque color and bounce back when pressed. Keep it hot but not burning. Onions char nicely, add bite but avoid blackening."
- "Vermicelli can be tricky. Boil, then rinse. They need to be soft yet firm. Stop cooking immediately with cold water. Toss warm with half the vinaigrette to prevent sticking."
- "Adjusting flavors? Taste as you go; lime juice can lift flavors. If dressing salty, splash of water or more lime juice. Don't drown the ingredients in vinaigrette too early; keep lettuce crisp."
- "Herb substitutions work well. If mint unavailable, cilantro or basil can switch easily for different aroma. Texture's key here; you want crunch from cucumbers not mush from over-wilted lettuce."
- "Leftovers? Store shrimp and salad separately. Shrimp stays great up to two days in the fridge. Salad could get soggy—keep dressing on the side until ready. Reheat shrimp nicely, not too long."
faq:
- "q: Can I use frozen shrimp? a: Yes—thaw fully, then pat dry. Cooking time may vary; always check color and texture. Don't cook from frozen, leads to rubbery texture."
- "q: What if I don’t have cilantro or mint? a: Basil can work instead. Different fragrance, fresh yet distinctive. Adjust quantities as needed to maintain freshness."
- "q: Want more heat in dressing? a: Add more chili garlic sauce or fresh minced chili. Spice it up carefully. Too much can overpower balance; be cautious."
- "q: How do I know when the vermicelli is done? a: Check at about 2 minutes, should feel soft yet firm. Rinse right away to stop cooking process, avoid mushy texture."
