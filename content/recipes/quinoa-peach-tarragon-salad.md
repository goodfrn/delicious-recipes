ingredients:
- "480 ml (2 cups) water"
- "260 ml (1 cup) quinoa"
- "1 litre (4 cups) broccoli florets, chopped small"
- "375 g (3/4 lb) green beans, ends trimmed"
- "1 large mango, peeled and diced"
- "1 lemon, zested"
- "60 ml (1/4 cup) olive oil"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) freshly squeezed lemon juice"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) fresh tarragon, finely chopped"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Heat water to full boil in a medium saucepan. Pour quinoa in, cover, drop heat to low. Cook until water absorbed and quinoa is fluffy not mushy. Eyes open: grains separated, tender but with a slight bite. Around 15 to 17 minutes. Remove from heat, leave covered 5 minutes. Fluff with fork to separate grains and cool faster."
- "Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Blanch broccoli until bright green, tender-crisp. Roughly 2-3 minutes. Drain, immediately rinse under cold water or plunge into ice bath to stop cooking. Drain well, set aside."
- "Preheat grill or grill pan to medium-high. Oil grates well to prevent sticking. Grill green beans until blistered with slight char but firm to bite. Around 5 to 7 minutes, turning often for even marks. Cut into 4 cm (1 1/2 inch) pieces once grilled."
- "In large bowl, combine quinoa, broccoli, grilled beans, mango chunks."
- "Add lemon zest, lemon juice, olive oil, fresh tarragon. Season with salt and pepper. Toss gently but thoroughly for even dressing and flavor distribution. Taste, adjust seasoning."
- "Serve chilled or at room temperature."
introduction: "Fresh, bright layers here. Quinoa base, nutty, light, but keep eyes peeled–overcooking makes it gluey, flop city. Swap peaches for mango for a punchier tropical sweet note. Tarragon’s herbal punch, lemon zest kick up brightness, no boring blandness here. Grill green beans, replace nuts with crunch from charred fibers, not mandatory but ups texture game. Broccoli’s the silent partner, blanched just so, vibrant green, still holding bite—don't overdo. Playing with texture and temps. Serve cool or just off the grill warmth—you’ll notice different flavors bubbling up. No fuss dressings, simple oil and acid combo. Watch salt closely here; quinoa can be bland. Use fine salt for best dispersion. Quinoa needs fluffing–not stirring; fork only or risk mush. Old quinoa? Rinse well to wash off natural coating to avoid bitterness. Perfect for a midweek lunch or starter for guests who expect more than limp salads. Make ahead yes, keep chilled but dress close to serving time. Mango’s moisture can weigh down if left too long."
ingredientsNote: "Quinoa’s a champion grain for gluten-free folks but mind your brand; some need rinsing to remove saponins that taste bitter and soap-like. Substitute green beans for asparagus—they char faster, more accessible year-round and hold texture well on the grill—if no grill, pan roast with a splash of oil and dry heat. Mango swaps in for peach; firmer, less watery, less likely to fall apart during mixing. Use fresh tarragon only, dried doesn’t carry that aniseed perfume needed here. Lemon zest can be switched to lime zest but will alter overall flavor profile slightly to more tropical tartness. Olive oil here must be good quality; avoid cheap, bitter oils that spoil the salad’s freshness. If no fresh tarragon, a mix of fresh basil and a pinch of dried dill can edge close but not the same punch. Salt use must be cautious. Quinoa and lemon juice can heighten the perception of bitterness if too sharp. Substitutions: kale instead of broccoli for earthier note but requires longer blanching, about 4-5 minutes, same ice bath finish."
instructionsNote: "Boiling quinoa properly is key; watch water ratio, usually 2:1 water to quinoa, less water leaves grains dry and undercooked, too much water mush. The fluffing step after cooking cannot be skipped—fluff with fork gently to separate the grains, else clumped wet piles ruin texture. Blanch broccoli briefly until bright green, not soggy; texture shows doneness better than any timer. The immediate cold shock stops cooking and locks color; no one wants olive drab broccoli. For grilling green beans, oiling grill grates prevents sticking, an often overlooked step. Turn beans frequently to get even char marks and avoid burning. If using oven, roast at 220°C (430°F) for 10-12 min instead, shaking pan mid-way. Dressing: add olive oil and acid last to warm quinoa so it absorbs flavors better. Tarragon chopped finely; too large pieces overpower bites. Toss salad gently—vigorous stirring bruises the fruit and crushes quinoa texture; keep it alive and airy. Salad can be prepared several hours ahead but add dressing and fruit last minute to prevent sogginess. Serve slightly cool or room temp so you taste all elements—cold mutes flavors, too warm brings out unwanted bitterness in herbs."
tips:
- "Use quality quinoa. Rinse before cooking if required. Check for saponins. Burning bits? That's bitterness; you want to avoid it. Too little water? Dry grains."
- "Blanch broccoli until bright and crisp. Ice bath right after. Stops cooking instantly. No one likes soggy broccoli. Flavor and color locked in right away."
- "Green beans only need a few minutes on the grill. Turn often. Get those blistered spots but keep the crunch. If no grill? Roasting works, too. High temp."
- "Dressing can be mixed right before serving. Adds freshness. But wait too long? Fruits can get soggy—texture ruined. Serve cool or at room temp."
- "Garnish with more fresh herbs. Brightens up the dish. Missing tarragon? Fresh basil and dill can step in. Just won't be the same herbal punch."
faq:
- "q: How to keep quinoa fluffy? a: Water ratio is key. 2:1 works. Undercooked? Add more. Overcooked? Rinse and fluff. Check texture for doneness."
- "q: Can I substitute mango? a: Sure, but pick something firm. Avoid soft choices. Peaches? If ripe they can work but texture changes. Not as stable."
- "q: How long does this salad last? a: Store in the fridge. Up to 3 days. But add dressing fresh. Too long, fruits release moisture. No good."
- "q: What if I don't have fresh tarragon? a: Use fresh basil, tiny bit of dill. Not same flavor. But still adds nice notes. Use your instincts."
