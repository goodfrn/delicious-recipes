slug: "linguine-lamb-ragout"
description: "Lamb shoulder cubes browned then simmered in crushed tomatoes and beef broth with kalamata olives replaced. Cooking done in pressure cooker saves time but watch for aroma cues. Onions softened to sweetness key. Pasta boiled al dente separately then combined with sauce. Olive substitution shifts flavor toward briny depth. Total cooking around 55 minutes with focus on texture and doneness rather than clock."

ingredients:
- "400 g boneless lamb shoulder trimmed and cut in cubes"
- "25 ml olive oil"
- "1 large shallot finely diced"
- "1 can 700 ml crushed San Marzano tomatoes"
- "240 ml beef stock low sodium"
- "35 g (1/4 cup) chopped green Castelvetrano olives"
- "340 g linguines"
- "1 sprig fresh rosemary (optional)"
- "Pinch of dried chili flakes"
instructions:
- "Heat pressure cooker on sauté mode for 3 minutes. Oil hot, surface shimmering. Toss in lamb cubes, scatter salt & pepper. Let sear without moving for golden crust. Hear faint crackle; meat edges firming. Flip, repeat browning every side. Lamb must caramelize, not steam. Remove meat; set aside."
- "In same pot, toss diced shallots, stir gently till translucent and soft but not brown, about 5 minutes. Aromatic sweet scent rising. Add rosemary sprig now for subtle pine notes and chili flakes for faint heat. Pour in crushed tomatoes and beef stock. Stir, scraping bottom to deglaze browned bits—flavor gold mined here. Return lamb, olives folded in. Check seasoning."
- "Seal pressure lid; select meat/stew setting; cook 18 minutes. Pressure rises, steam hisses—wait but do not rush to open. Let natural release happen for 20 minutes. This finish allows meat fibers to relax, juice redistribute. Sauce thickens, reducing slightly during pressure and slow release. Remove rosemary sprig before serving."
- "Parallel: boil large pot salted water hard boil first; add linguines when vigorously rolling boil happens. Stir regularly, test early; pasta still firm to bite with slight chew—al dente. Usually around 9 minutes, depends on pasta brand. Drain well, do not rinse or pasta loses surface starch that helps sauce cling."
- "Off heat, add drained linguines to sauce pot. Use tongs or wooden spoon to fold thoroughly. Sauce coats every strand lightly yet fully. Taste, adjust salt, pepper or a splash of lemon juice if too heavy. Let sit 2 minutes off heat to marry flavors."
- "Serve immediately. Garnish optional with fresh basil or finely grated hard cheese if dairy tolerated; otherwise a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil brightens."
- "Common pitfalls: rushing browning, ending with watery sauce, overcooked pasta. Fix by controlling heat upfront, remove lid when safe to reduce thickness if needed, and taste pasta early to avoid mush."
- "Substitutions: chicken stock if no beef. Black olives for green if unavailable but adjust salt carefully. Shallots can be yellow onion but slightly more pungent."
introduction: "Lamb shoulder chunks browned hard to develop that rich crust—do not crowd the pan or steam will kill flavor. Shallots in place of onion for gentler sweetness that melts into sauce. Skip the usual black olives and pick bright green Castelvetrano for briny punch not bitterness. Pressure cooker cuts long stew times; watch aroma and natural pressure release for best texture. Pasta cooked al dente separately, drained with care, then folded into sauce to avoid mush. Simple but watch the details—the sauce must cling, lamb must be tender but not falling apart. Sizzle, hiss, and reduction aromas guide timing. Reproducible technique that works in any time crunch or casual weeknight."
ingredientsNote: "Lamb shoulder trimmed is key, fat left helps keep moist but trim bulky chunks for even cooking. Oil must be good quality olive oil; virgin but not extra heavy flavor to not overpower lamb. Shallots chosen over plain onions for their mild aromatic profile that blends well in slow-cooked sauces without harsh edges. Crushed San Marzano tomatoes bring authentic Italian acid-sweetness; can swap canned plum tomatoes but crush them. Beef stock adds body, vegetable stock can substitute for lighter versions though less depth. Slightly salty green Castelvetrano olives add a mild fruity brine; dry black olives usually bring more bitterness – adjust accordingly. Rosemary optional but adds layer of herbaceous pine that wants slow slow cooking to release. Chili flakes bring heat balance without dominating. Linguines standard but tagliatelle or fettuccine can work if easier for you. Ingredient ratios tweaked slightly for proportional balance but adaptable depending on taste or pantry."
instructionsNote: "Sauté lamb cubes first to get proper caramelization not boiling or stewing them. Temperature control the hardest part; too hot burns outside before inside cooks. Using sauté mode on cooker convenient but listen to sizzle and smell cues, aim for golden brown surfaces. Remove lamb before adding aromatics to avoid overcooking and mushy texture. Gentle cooking of shallots important to unlock sweetness but watch carefully so no browning happens, prevent bitterness. Deglazing ensures no stuck bits burnt, key even flavor distribution. Pressure cook timing slightly shorter than traditional braises to prevent over softening. Natural pressure release mandatory, forcing quick pressure release toughens meat fibers. Cook linguines separately—always—because pasta will overcook in sauce or toughen by absorbing too much liquid. Toss cooked pasta hot into sauce to warm through but not finish cooking. Final seasoning adjustment taste critical; balance acidity, salt, and spiciness last step. Garnish optional but a drizzle of fresh olive oil brightens dish. Remember leftovers thicken; add splash of water or stock upon reheating."
tips:
- "Searing lamb first. Essential for flavor. Crust is key. Heat must be right. Not too hot or too low. Caramelize but don’t steam. Listen for the sizzle."
- "Shallots over yellow onion. Why? Gentle sweetness. Shallots melt into sauce. Cook slowly. Aim for translucence, not brown. Brown means bitterness; that won’t work."
- "Deglazing is vital. Scrape those bits off the bottom. Adds depth to sauce. Timing matters here too; don’t let them burn. Flavor without char."
- "Boil pasta separately. No way around this one; absorbs too much moisture if added to sauce. Test early for that al dente bite. Drain quickly but do not rinse."
- "Adjust seasoning at the end. Too heavy? Lemon juice does wonders. Salt brings flavors alive. Important to taste; an under-seasoned dish loses potential."
- "Natural pressure release must happen. Quick release toughens meat. Important to understand texture here. Allow fibers to relax, redistribute juices."
faq:
- "q: What if lamb is tough? a: Overcooked likely. Braise shorter. Always check tenderness before pressure release. Think about leaving it longer or adding liquid."
- "q: Can I use another meat? a: Sure, chicken stock works fine. But adjust seasonings. Pork could also work, but timing varies. Always check texture."
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Keep it simple. Fridge in airtight. Can freeze too; use within three months. Gentle reheat on stovetop works best."
- "q: What if sauce is watery? a: Cook longer with lid off to reduce. Learn to check thickness and adjust. Focus on flavors here; consider adding starch."
