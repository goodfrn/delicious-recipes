title: "Cranberry Pineapple Mold"
slug: "cranberry-pineapple-mold"
description: "Cold-set gelatin salad with cranberry, juice swap and walnuts instead of pecans. Pineapple introduces moisture balance and sweetness contrast. Heavy cream whipped separately to soft peaks adds airy richness on top rather than mixed in. Textural variation with chunky cranberry sauce against smooth gelatin and crunchy nuts. Low sodium, moderate sugar content makes it accessible. Set firm but jiggle still visible, not rock solid mold. Refreshing winter side with fresh lemon juice brightening instead of straight straight cranberry juice. Fresh lavender leaves for garnish if you want a reset to usual mint. Can make ahead easily, holds shape well chilled."

ingredients:
- "1 package raspberry gelatin dessert mix (3 ounces)"
- "1 cup boiling water"
- "1 cup cran-apple juice (sub chicken broth if savory needed)"
- "1 can whole cranberry sauce (14 ounces)"
- "1 can crushed pineapple, drained (20 ounces)"
- "1 cup chopped walnuts (can swap toasted almonds)"
- "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice"
- "1 cup heavy whipping cream (for whipping)"
- "Fresh lavender or mint leaves for garnish"
- "Nonstick spray or butter to grease dish"
instructions:
- "Grease a 9x13-inch glass or ceramic dish lightly with oil or butter. Set aside so no sticking after."
- "Dissolve gelatin into 1 cup freshly boiled water. Stir with a whisk vigorously until no granules or powder visible; mixture glossy and translucent."
- "Add cran-apple juice and lemon juice to gelatin. Taste test slightly tart; lemon juice balances cranberry juice sweetness. Adjust if needed with more lemon."
- "Fold in whole cranberry sauce, breaking up large chunks but keeping some texture intact. Stir in the crushed pineapple drained well to avoid watery salad."
- "Mix in chopped walnuts evenly through mixture. Nuts give crunch. Toast beforehand for flavor or use almonds for subtler taste."
- "Pour mixture into prepped 9x13 dish. Swirl to smooth surface. The gelatin jiggle should be consistent, no lumps or dry spots."
- "Chill uncovered in refrigerator until set, about 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Look for firm edges pulling slightly away from dish, center still jiggles softly, not liquid."
- "Right before serving, whip heavy cream to soft peaks. Should hold shape but easily fold with spoon. Avoid overwhip turning granular."
- "Slice into squares or scoop with a large spoon. Garnish with dollops of whipped cream and fresh lavender or mint leaves for herbaceous freshness."
- "Store leftovers covered tightly. If watery appears after refrigeration, whisk gently to reincorporate liquids without breaking gel."
introduction: "Gelatin salads—an acquired taste for some—but worth mastering for holiday tables or quick make-ahead sides. The key is balancing textures: the sticky, bursting sweetness of whole cranberry sauce, combined with the juicy pineapple chunks, and the crunch of walnuts. Use cran-apple juice instead of pure cranberry for mildness; lemon juice cuts through the sweetness without overwhelming acid. Heavy cream whipped separately lends smooth richness on top without sogginess inside. Watch that gelatin dissolves fully—a common trap is grainy jelly. Chill until firm but still jiggles slightly when nudged. Garnishes brighten appearance and add an herb note, something different. Multitask this with holiday prep, letting it chill while you work other dishes."
ingredientsNote: "Gelatin quality matters. Use flavored gelatin packets, but raspberry works better than straight cranberry to avoid harsh tartness. Cran-apple juice softens flavor and adds subtle acidity; full cranberry juice can be too sharp or bitter. Cranberry sauce—choose whole berry style, preferably with bits intact for texture contrast; avoid smooth jellied versions. Pineapple drained well; excess juice dilutes set, causing watery turn. Nuts—walnuts bring earthiness and crunch. Swap with chopped pecans or almonds if preferred; toasting nuts beforehand pulls out oils and intensifies flavor. Heavy cream used only for topping to keep salad from getting soggy inside. Use butter or oil spray to grease dish, less mess than waxed paper or foil, especially if ceramic dish."
instructionsNote: "Oiling dish prevents gelatin salad from sticking, crucial for clean removal without breaking. Dissolving gelatin carefully is step one—use a whisk, stir consistently, no lumps. Waiting too long before adding juice risks gelatin setting prematurely. Adding lemon juice with juice helps balance acidity; taste to adjust. Folding cranberry sauce gently retains bursts of flavor instead of blending into uniform texture. Draining pineapple avoids excess water, which can make mold watery on bottom. Chilling uncovered lets excess moisture evaporate, better texture. Whip cream prior to serving for best volume and mouthfeel; soft peaks allow easy dollops, melts quickly over cold salad. When slicing, use a wet knife to prevent sticking. If watery liquid pools, whisk gently or stir mid-chill to reincorporate without breaking gel."
tips:
- "Greasing the dish matters a lot. Use oil or butter; nonstick cooking spray even works. Avoid mess later. Want a clean release? Trust the grease."
- "Don't rush dissolving gelatin. Hot water is key here. Stir well—no grains. Glossy texture is needed. Add juice right after, timing is important."
- "Pineapple must be well-drained, no extra juice! Too much liquid means a runny mold. Drain, then pat with paper towels if excess remains."
- "Heavy cream whipped at the right moment adds lightness. Whip to soft peaks only. Overwhipping leads to stiffness; aim for cream that holds shape."
- "If leftovers pool moisture, gently whisk before serving. Avoid breaking up the gel; it’s all about restoring texture without ruining the mold."
faq:
- "q: How long can it stay in the fridge? a: At least 3 days. Always keep it covered. If it gets watery, whisk gently but don’t break the gel."
- "q: Can I use another flavor of gelatin? a: Yes, raspberry works best. Other flavors may clash. Experiment if you want, but stick to fruity."
- "q: What if I skip walnuts? a: You can use pecans or almonds. If nut-free, sunflower seeds can work too. Just keep crunch in your salad."
- "q: Can I make this mold ahead of time? a: Absolutely, prepare a day in advance. Chilling is key. Let it set properly before serving, no rushing."
