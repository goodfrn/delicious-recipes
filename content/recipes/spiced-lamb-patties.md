slug: "spiced-lamb-patties"
description: "Ground lamb seasoned with cumin and smoked paprika, mixed with fresh herbs and lemon juice. Patties are grilled alongside lime halves rubbed with oil until blistered and smoky. Resting the meat mix chills flavors and firms texture. Quick sear on medium-high heat locks in juices. Citrus adds bright acidity and caramelized oils. Suitable for gluten, nut, egg, dairy intolerances. Variations include swapping lamb for beef or turkey; herbs adjustable to whatever's fresh — dill or mint work well. Cooks fast. Listen for sizzle, look for firm edges, juices clear through the center. Used for mezze or main portions. Practical, straight to the point."

ingredients:
- "1 small shallot, finely minced"
- "1 garlic clove, finely chopped"
- "20 ml olive oil"
- "300 g lean ground lamb"
- "8 ml ground cumin"
- "5 ml smoked paprika"
- "10 ml dried oregano"
- "50 ml fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped"
- "50 ml fresh mint, chopped"
- "juice of half a lime"
- "salt and freshly ground black pepper"
- "4 lime halves"
- "extra olive oil, for brushing"
instructions:
- "=> Sweat shallots and garlic gently in 15 ml olive oil over medium heat until soft and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Avoid browning; just softened translucency. Remove from heat and cool slightly."
- "=> In a large bowl, combine lamb, cumin, smoked paprika, oregano, parsley, mint, lime juice, and the cooled shallots with garlic. Season generously with salt and pepper. Mix lightly but thoroughly; avoid overworking or you get a dense texture."
- "=> Cover bowl with plastic wrap or a plate. Chill in fridge minimum 90 minutes to let flavors meld and patties to firm up for easy shaping."
- "=> Preheat grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Oil grates or pan well to prevent sticking."
- "=> Form the meat into 8 even patties. Should feel springy but hold shape. If sticking, wet hands slightly."
- "=> Brush lime halves with olive oil."
- "=> Grill patties and lime halves simultaneously. Patties need about 5 to 6 minutes per side depending on thickness. Don’t press down; that squeezes juices out. Look for firm edges, meat pulling away from sides, juices running clear when pierced. The lime should blacken and blister, releasing fragrant oils."
- "=> Transfer patties and citrus to plate. Let meat rest 5 minutes to redistribute juices."
- "=> Squeeze grilled lime juices over patties at serving. Bitter charred lime oils cut richness, final touch."
- "=> Serve alongside simple salad or flatbread if not strictly avoiding gluten."
introduction: "Lamb needs a delicate hand; too much mixing and it’s tough. Spices here — cumin, smoked paprika — punch without overwhelming. Fresh herbs bring brightness. Using lime instead of lemon shifts acidity slightly; more aromatic, less sharp. Taking time to sweat shallots gently extracts sweetness without bitterness. Chilling meat mix before shaping is vital. It firms the fat and proteins to hold patties stable and juicy. Grilling is about timing — a few minutes per side over hot coals or cast iron grill marks, turning once, never poking or pressing. Charred lime halves crushed on top balance richness with smoky, tart notes. Takes under 40 minutes altogether but demands attention to texture and aroma. Great for casual outdoor cooking, quick midweek meals."
ingredientsNote: "Swapping shallot for onion is common and fine, but shallots bring a subtle sweetness that won’t overpower. Smoked paprika replaces oregano in part; adds depth and a little heat that oregano lacks. Mint replaces chives not just for flavor but also freshness; it pairs better with lamb’s gamey profile. Olive oil quantity adjusted upward to ensure meat doesn’t stick and keeps a moist bite, especially with leaner cuts. Lime halves replace lemon for grilling—they char beautifully without bitterness. If lamb is too lean, add teaspoon of olive oil or finely minced fat back to the mix to avoid dryness. Missing grill? A cast iron pan works fine, just watch heat and oil. Season well with salt or meat will taste dull."
instructionsNote: "Sweat shallots and garlic slowly — if they brown, flavor turns bitter, which spoils the mix. Cooling before adding them stops cooking the meat too early and prevents breaking down proteins, which would affect texture. Mixing minimal but thorough — use hands, fold gently; over-mixing is a trap every rookie misses. Chilling an hour at least firms the fat so patties hold. Grill medium-high; too hot and outside chars but inside stays raw; too cool and patties dry and stick. Look for faint juices on surface as sign for flipping. Avoid stabbing with fork; use tongs to keep juices inside. Lime halves blacken and blister; squeeze carefully, avoid seeds. Rest patties before eating; it’s crucial for juiciness. Use extra virgin olive oil for brushing. The sizzle signals when to turn — listen for it. If flare-ups happen, move patties briefly."
tips:
- "Watch for shallots; gentle sweating, no browning. They’ll turn bitter. See them go translucent, then remove. Avoid mushy textures in mix."
- "Chill meat mix at least 90 minutes. It firms up like magic. Makes shaping patties easy. Keeps them from falling apart on grill."
- "Grill heat matters; medium-high is key. Too hot, outside chars, inside raw. Too cool? Dry patties that stick. Listen; look for sizzle."
- "Juices running clear means nearing doneness; don’t poke, use tongs. It’s about holding in flavor. Don’t squeeze out the moisture."
- "Resting patties is crucial. Helps juices redistribute. Five whole minutes. Squeeze that charred lime over before serving for final zesty kick."
faq:
- "q: Why is my lamb dry? a: Overcooked. Look for firm edges, clear juices. Adjust grill heat. Maybe add a bit of olive oil if too lean."
- "q: Can I use beef instead? a: Absolutely. Flavor shifts; same technique works. Always season to taste. Keep herbs fresh, consistent."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in an airtight container; up to three days. Reheat gently. Avoid overcooking again. Flavor changes when cold."
- "q: Any tips for indoor grilling? a: Use cast iron. Watch heat closely. Oil surface, avoid sticking. A bit of patience needed. Keep grill marks."
