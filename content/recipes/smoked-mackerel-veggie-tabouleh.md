ingredients:
- "130 g (3/4 cup) whole wheat bulgur"
- "225 ml (1 cup) boiling water"
- "2 grilled red bell peppers, seeded, peeled, diced"
- "½ zucchini, diced"
- "45 g (1 cup) flat leaf parsley, chopped"
- "2 tbsp chopped chives"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) olive oil"
- "1 lemon, zest grated"
- "20 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) lemon juice"
- "1 clove garlic, minced"
- "2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) chili paste"
- "200 g (7 oz) smoked mackerel fillets, skin removed, flaked"
- "Salt and black pepper"
instructions:
- "Place bulgur in a large bowl. Pour boiling water over. Cover tightly and let soak 12 minutes. Fluff with fork gently to separate kernels."
- "Add diced red peppers, zucchini, parsley, and chives to bulgur. Stir in olive oil, lemon zest, juice, minced garlic, and chili paste. Mix thoroughly."
- "Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Taste and adjust acidity or heat as preferred."
- "Divide mixture onto plates or bowls. Top with flaked smoked mackerel evenly."
- "Optional garnish: additional lemon zest or a few parsley leaves."
introduction: "Bulgur swollen with steaming water. Red peppers charred, fiery red, diced chunks. Zucchini instead of cucumber, fresh crunch but softer, lighter green. Parsley, big rough leaves chopped coarse. Chives instead of onions for milder punch. Lemon zest and juice—bright and tart. Garlic minced fine, fiery sparks hit the tongue. Chili paste for heat, not overwhelming, just a whisper. Smoked mackerel flaked over, oily flesh, smoky depth. Salt, pepper, nothing else needed. Fresh. Crisp. Balanced. No faff, no extra fuss. A tabouleh reborn with smoky fish, veggies swapped but spirit intact. Eat cold or room temp, a bold but easy main."
ingredientsNote: "Bulgur soaks quickly, faster than couscous, keeps bite. Red bell peppers grilled beforehand, skins peeled for smooth texture — skip charred bits if you prefer. Zucchini diced similar size to peppers keeps balance, mild flavor, adds moisture. Chives bring subtle onion note without sharpness from green onions. Lemon zest lends brightness and aroma, juice adds zing. Chillies replaced with a smidge of chili paste, which blends easier, spreads heat evenly—adjust to taste. Smoked mackerel potted or filleted, skin removed so no chew or bitterness. Olive oil binds, bronze golden. Salt carefully, smoked fish salty already. Freshness in every bite, no heavy sauces or dairy."
instructionsNote: "Bulgur absorbs hot water fully in about 12 minutes, longer soak thickens textures but becomes mushy, stick to timing. Cover bowl or cling film to trap steam. Fluff carefully with fork to keep grains separate, avoid mashing. Stir in peppers and zucchini — raw, no cooking needed, preserves crunch, freshness. Mix oil, lemon, garlic, chili paste separately if needed, then fold in gently to coat evenly. Taste before seasoning. Salt with restraint; smoked fish adds saltiness. Lay mackerel on top last to prevent breaking down in mix, keeps texture intact. Serve immediately or after chilling briefly. Tabouleh changes texture chilled but flavors meld well. Garnish with zest or herbs last minute for brightness."
tips:
- "Bulgur needs hot water for 12 minutes. Cover it tightly. This traps steam. Fluff with fork later. No mashing. Keep grains separate."
- "Grill red peppers ahead. Peel skins off for smooth texture. Diced zucchini offers mild flavor. Keeps crunch. Match sizes for balance."
- "Adjust chili paste according to taste. Blend in well. Garlic brings a kick. Lemon zest brightens up. A little acidity goes far."
- "Use restraint when salting. Smoked mackerel is already salty. Taste before adding more. Fresh herbs keep it lively and aromatic."
- "Serve this dish cold or at room temp. Chilling lets flavors meld. Garnish last minute for a fresh touch. Zest or herbs work."
faq:
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. They'll keep for two days. Can also freeze. But texture changes after thawing."
- "q: What if I don’t have bulgur? a: Quinoa or couscous works too. Cooking times vary slightly. Adjust water amounts to ensure right texture."
- "q: Is there a vegetarian version? a: Yes, skip the fish. Add more veggies. Chickpeas are a good protein option. Texture stays interesting."
- "q: Can I make this ahead of time? a: Yes, prepare everything and mix just before serving. Keeps well in fridge. But mackerel on top last."
