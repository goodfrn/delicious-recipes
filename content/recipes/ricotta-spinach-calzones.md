slug: "ricotta-spinach-calzones"
description: "Hand-shaped calzones stuffed with a creamy blend of ricotta, mozzarella, and feta, fresh spinach, and scallions. The dough is portioned, rolled thin, then crimped tight to trap the hot cheese filling. Baked at high heat until golden brown with hints of caramelized spots. Ideal for vegetarian mains. Avoid soggy bottoms by proper dough thickness and egg wash seal. Variations include substituting mozzarella with provolone and adding nutmeg to the cheese mix."

ingredients:
- "365 g (1 ½ cups) ricotta cheese"
- "90 g (¾ cup) shredded provolone cheese"
- "60 g (½ cup) crumbled feta cheese"
- "3 green onions chopped"
- "60 ml (4 tbsp) chopped fresh basil"
- "100 g (packed) fresh spinach leaves roughly chopped"
- "1 batch pizza dough for 6 portions"
- "Water for sealing edges"
- "Olive oil for brushing"
instructions:
- "Position oven rack in center; preheat oven to 240°C (465°F). Line baking sheet with parchment to prevent sticking."
- "In medium bowl, combine ricotta, provolone, feta, spinach, green onions, and basil. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper. Mix until even. Spinach adds moisture; don't over-wilt to avoid sogginess."
- "Dust work surface lightly with flour. Divide dough into six equal parts. Keep unused dough covered with damp cloth to prevent drying."
- "Roll each ball into 20 cm (8 inch) discs—not too thin; aim for even thickness to withstand filling. Spoon ~70 ml (1/3 cup) of cheese-spinach mix in center. Brush half the perimeter with cold water to help edges stick."
- "Fold dough over filling into a half-moon shape, gently elongate edges while pressing to seal tight with fingers. Seal edges tighter than a pie to trap steam and prevent burst. If seal is weak, dough will open during baking and leak."
- "Using a wide spatula, transfer calzones onto baking sheet. Space slightly apart. Brush tops generously with olive oil for crisp golden crust."
- "Bake 18 minutes or until calzones develop deep golden hue with patches of darker brown. The smell of toasted cheese and herbs will fill kitchen. Bottom should crisp rather than stay pale."
- "If after 15 minutes crust remains pale, switch oven to broil and watch closely to avoid burning—typically 2-3 minutes—to get perfect spots of color on top."
- "Remove carefully with spatula. Let rest on wire rack 5 minutes before serving. Filling will be molten hot—let it set to avoid burns."
introduction: "Ricotta’s soft creaminess married to sharp provolone and crumbly feta gives these calzones a complex melty interior with just enough tang. Spinach folds in moisture but keep it fresh, don’t steam it too long or the dough sogs out. The key here is high heat for quick crust color without drying filling, and tight crimping—don’t skimp on pressing edges or you’ll end up with cheese escaping and a messy bake. Use olive oil generous they not just taste good but brown properly, no pale flabby crusts here. Tried a swap of mozzarella for provolone to add depth, feta adds bite while basil brings herbaceous brightness. Green onions instead of regular onions keeps it sharp but light—an advantage when balancing multiple cheeses. Timing is loose; watch crust until amber and bubbles appear."
ingredientsNote: "Ricotta is base but swap portion of mozzarella for provolone to get milder melt and richer flavor. Feta is less sweet, adds salty tang that cuts whites rather than blending into monotony. Fresh spinach raw works fine if chopped small—if pre-cooking, squeeze all moisture out so dough can't get soggy. Adding basil is optional but recommended for fresh bite. Water brushing ensures seal but too much; dough can get gummy. Olive oil gives crust crunch and glossy sheen. Dough thickness critical—thin enough to crisp but not so thin it tears during folding. If low on time, pre-shaping dough and keeping covered avoids drying and cracking."
instructionsNote: "Start with dough at room temp, easier to roll and less spring back. Always dust surface lightly to avoid sticking without incorporating too much flour which toughens crust. Folding is task that needs care—wet edges then press firmly to seal—weak seals cause leaks, messy oven. Use spatula to transfer calzones onto sheet, lifting from base; dough stretches and loses shape if you scoop improperly—shaping onsite preferred. Watch oven closely in last minutes, broil short while for spots to deepen but don’t leave unattended or crust burns quickly. Rest after baking lets cheese settle before cutting, avoids lava-hot filling burns. If calzones fill with steam and puff too much, prick dough lightly before baking to vent steam, but don’t overdo or filling escapes."
tips:
- "Roll dough evenly. Don't rush this. Watch for thickness. Too thin? Dough tears. Too thick? Chewy results. Aim for balance. Let it rest."
- "Seal edges tightly. Important step. A weak crimp leaks filling in the oven. Press firmly; make sure no gaps. Water helps stick. Do it right."
- "Heating calzones properly matters. High temp for crispness. Too low? Soggy bottoms. If they puff up, poke a hole. Let steam escape safely."
- "Olive oil on top is key. A generous brush creates a glossy finish. Enhances browning. Avoid pale, flabby crusts. Watch closely during baking."
- "Timing can shift. Oven variances. Check for golden color and bubbling cheese. Don’t leave the broiler unattended. A fast way to ruin."
- "Filling can be altered. Swap provolone or add nutmeg. Mix up greens too; think kale or Swiss chard. Cheese combo can vary; get creative."
faq:
- "q: How to properly store leftover calzones? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. Keeps for 2-3 days. Can freeze too. Just wrap tightly; avoid freezer burn. When reheating, bake or pan-fry for best texture."
- "q: What's a common issue with dough? a: If too springy it snaps back. Let it rest longer. Make sure it’s warm. Cold dough wraps tightly. If overworked, it toughens. Handle gently when shaping."
- "q: Can I make the filling ahead? a: Yes, prep before. Store in fridge for day or two. Fill right before baking for best results. Don’t let spinach wilt too much; keeps things fresh."
- "q: Broiler or regular bake? a: Both have place. Broiler for topping color. Check closely. Too long? Burns happen fast. Regular bake for full cook, avoid sogginess. Use combined methods for best browning."
