ingredients:
- "1 acorn squash, unpeeled, seeded, thinly quartered"
- "2 cloves garlic, peeled"
- "30 g (2 tbsp) olive oil"
- "180 ml (3/4 cup) vegetable broth"
- "4 carrots, quartered"
- "4 parsnips, quartered"
- "8 small golden beets, cooked and quartered"
- "120 g (4 cups) kale leaves, coarsely chopped and blanched"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) toasted sesame seeds"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) chopped fresh rosemary"
- "=== Dressing ==="
- "75 ml (1/3 cup) mayonnaise"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) tahini"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) apple cider vinegar"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) maple syrup"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) fresh lemon juice"
- "2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) smoked paprika"
- "1 reserved roasted garlic clove, chopped"
instructions:
- "=== Vegetables ==="
- "1 In a large nonstick skillet or heavy pan over medium-high, heat half the olive oil until it shimmers but not smoking. Add squash quarters and whole garlic cloves. Season well with salt and pepper. Sear until edges caramelize, roughly 6-7 minutes, scraping bottom to loosen browned bits. You want a golden crust and tender bite, poke with a knife to check softness. Pour 125 ml vegetable broth, cover tightly, reduce heat to medium-low. Let steam until liquid evaporates and squash pierces easily but is still intact, about 7-8 minutes. Remove garlic cloves, set aside for dressing. Transfer squash to a large serving plate."
- "2 Without wiping pan, add remaining olive oil. Toss in carrots and parsnips. Salt and pepper immediately. Sauté, stirring occasionally, until they get a golden color and begin to soften, about 7 minutes. Add remaining broth and cover. Continue cooking until broth is absorbed and roots are tender when pierced but not mushy, about 6 minutes. Add to squash."
- "3 In same pan, melt any leftover oil and add beets along with blanched kale. Toss quickly just to heat through and coat greens lightly in pan fats. Remove from heat and combine with other veggies."
- "=== Dressing ==="
- "4 Finely chop reserved roasted garlic. In a small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, tahini, vinegar, maple syrup, lemon juice and smoked paprika until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in garlic last so flavor is pronounced but mellowed by roasting."
- "5 At serving, sprinkle toasted sesame seeds and rosemary evenly over vegetables. Drizzle or toss with dressing just before plating. Warm or room temp works. If kale looks wilted, add dressing in small batches to gauge moisture. Leftover dressing makes a good dip or sandwich spread."
- "Tips States vary but squashes with nutty skins dry out fast if overcooked — watch color and poke gently. Carots and parsnips need constant eye to avoid crisp edges turning bitter. Better to have firm crunch than soggy. Blanch kale quickly then shock in ice water for bright color and less bitterness. If no vegetable broth, dilute concentrated stock or use water but boost acid and fat in dressing for balance. Sesame seeds toast fast; smell nutty and listen for faint crackle."
introduction: "Kick things off with a load of winter veg—acorn squash replacing courge poivrée for nuttier touch. Garlic whole, roasting brings mellow sweet garlic aroma that you don’t get raw. Carrots and parsnips go golden in the pan, not steamed to sogginess. Golden beets stand in for yellow or chioggia, adding bright roasted sweetness without overpowering. Kale blanched and then just warmed through keeps pockets of crunch and a deep green pop. Toasted sesame seeds crackle under teeth, herbaceous rosemary threads throughout. Dressing tangy, creamy, with tahini’s silk replaced a pinch with smoked paprika and fresh lemon for a twist that lifts everything. Timing a bit flexible; rely on aromas and texture cues rather than fixed minutes. Simple, straightforward, but not boring."
ingredientsNote: "Swapped butter for olive oil for a more stable, fruity fat that handles sautéing and roasting without burning. Vegetable broth instead of chicken broth—more versatile, vegetarian friendly; if missing, well-seasoned water works. Golden beets add sweetness and color without overpowering, but regular red beets can replace if needed; just roast longer to mellow earthiness. Smoked paprika in the dressing boosts depth and adds a subtle warmth. Don’t skip roasting garlic whole; the mellow flavor underpins the tangy tahini vinaigrette and avoids harsh raw garlic bite. If kale is bitter, blanch in salted boiling water then plunge immediately into ice bath to lock color and tone down bitterness. Toast sesame seeds until just fragrant but not burnt; smell is the cue rather than color alone."
instructionsNote: "Start by heating oil until it just shimmers; too hot and you burn fats, too cool and you stew veggies dull. Searing squash first builds caramelized flavor and prevents mush—watch for chestnut brown edges with gentle give to skewer. Adding broth and covering traps steam and speeds cooking; liquid should absorb by end, leaving intense flavor without sogginess. Keeping garlic whole lets it soften evenly without soaking veggies in raw sharpness; reserve for dressing to add mellow background. Same pan cuts cleanup and preserves fond, which adds complexity to next veg batch. Pay close attention to carrot and parsnip texture — should be tender but with bite, not falling apart. Quickly warming kale off heat keeps vibrant color and avoids slimy texture. Dressing whisked until smooth binds flavor, adding garlic at end preserves mellow roast. Drizzle just before serving to keep sesame seeds crunchy. If leftovers go cold, warm gently to keep texture intact. Simple missteps: overcooking kale, rushed squash turning to mash, or dressing blending with veggie juices too early turning everything limp."
tips:
- "Watch oil heat; not too hot, or veggies burn. Searing squash first, mm. Focus on golden edges. Needs to pierce easily but hold together."
- "Broth in the pan? Yes, cover tightly. Surf steam effect. Always absorb fully, intensifies flavor. Final texture, look for tenderness without mush."
- "Kale blanched, then quick shock in ice water to hold color. Avoid bitterness. No boiling too long! Keep it green. Temperature matters."
- "Garlic whole goes in; roast it! Saves sharp raw flavor for sauce later. Makes for mellow sweetness. Chop for dressing end to keep punch."
- "Using golden beets adds sweetness. Skip red if needed but roast longer. Watch moisture levels. Not too wet, or soggy veggies are sad."
