ingredients:
- "3 cloves garlic minced"
- "1/3 cup finely diced red onion"
- "1/2 cup balsamic vinegar"
- "1/3 cup water"
- "1 cup fresh or frozen tart cherries"
- "3 tablespoons maple syrup"
- "1 teaspoon cornstarch"
- "1 tablespoon cold water"
instructions:
- "Start with minced garlic and diced red onion in a medium saucepan. No oil needed. Pour in balsamic vinegar, water, cherries, and maple syrup. Turn heat to medium-high until you hear the bubble popping and see steam rising."
- "Adjust heat so it simmers, not boils frantically. Stir occasionally. Watch liquid reduce and darken. Around 17-22 minutes it will thicken and stick to the spoon. Closer to a syrup than broth now."
- "Keep nose on it: a tangy-sweet aroma with roasted garlic rising. Cherry skins will soften but don’t puree completely. Visual is deep mahogany color, shiny and viscous enough to coat the back of a spoon cleanly."
- "Remove pan from heat. In a small bowl, whisk cornstarch into cold water until smooth—no lumps. Slowly drizzle slurry into sauce while stirring briskly to avoid clumps."
- "Return briefly to low heat. Stir 1 to 2 minutes; sauce visibly thickens, becomes glossy, slightly heavier. Don’t overcook or it gets gluey."
- "Pour warm glaze over sliced cooked ham right before serving. Keep extra glaze warm and stir occasionally to prevent setting. The sticky coating should be shiny and cling without running off."
- "If glaze is thin, simmer a few more minutes uncovered. Too thick or pasty? Stir in splash of water or more vinegar to loosen and brighten."
- "Use fresh cherries when in season. Frozen works but thaw first and drain excess juice for better control on consistency. Maple syrup adds subtle earthiness and cuts sharpness—brown sugar or honey are fine subs."
- "Substitute red onion with shallot or green onion for milder bite. Garlic powder can replace fresh garlic if fresh not on hand, but garlic’s bite is key here."
- "Glaze can be made ahead and reheated gently; add water as needed to adjust texture. Watch for lumps when reheating cornstarch-thickened sauces. Stir often."
- "Serve glaze spooned over ham thick enough to coat but not drowning the meat. The contrast of rich, tart balsamic and sweet cherries against savory ham creates complexity worth the attention."
introduction: "Warm skillet scents of garlic and onion fill the air. Balsamic vinegar bubbling down to dark syrup takes time. Cherry bits soften, skins sometimes pop releasing tart juices balancing maple’s sweetness. Patience with reducing means sticky, shiny glaze clinging to ham, not sliding off like water. Cornstarch slurry thickens without risking gritty texture; stir fast to avoid lumps. This is about watching transformations, knowing when to pull off heat by smell and look not timer. A swap or two changes flavor profile—maple for brown sugar adds subtle earthiness. Red onion here brings bite and depth unlike sweet shallots. Fresh cherries ideal summer; frozen an off-season cheat, just drain their extra juice first. Warm glaze spots the ham with gloss and tang, sealing savory meat with sticky-sweet charm. Real kitchens need flexible ingredients and fix methods; here’s that know-how."
ingredientsNote: "Garlic and red onion anchor savory base. Fresh garlic preferred for punch, but garlic powder works in a pinch—use about one-third the amount. Red onion chosen over shallot for sharper depth; use shallot if milder, or green onions for brightness. Balsamic vinegar must be good quality—cheap vinegar tastes harsh when reduced. Tart cherries for acidity and punch, frozen is fine but thaw and drain first to avoid watery glaze. Maple syrup instead of brown sugar introduces subtle earthiness and complexity. Brown sugar would add muted caramel notes but risks graininess if not dissolved properly. Water helps balance acidity and sweetness, don’t skip or glaze gets too thick too fast. Cornstarch thickens but mix with cold water first to avoid lumps. Alternatives like arrowroot can be used for glossy finish, but cook time and temperature adjustments needed."
instructionsNote: "Start medium-pan with garlic and onion, no oil needed. Liquid ingredients first, bring mixture quickly to simmer. Reduce heat to let bubbles pop quietly, not roiling boil. Stir often enough to prevent burning on bottom, but don’t overdo to keep cherries mostly intact. Look for dark mahogany color, glaze thick enough to coat spoon and hold streak when drawn across. Remove from heat before thickening too much; sauce will continue cooking off heat. Cornstarch slurry slowly incorporated while whisking to avoid lumps; critical here. Bring back briefly over low heat to activate thickener, watch carefully—overcooking results in gummy texture. Pour glaze warm over already cooked ham slices just before serving. Keep extra warm but off high heat, stir frequently. Adjust thickness last minute with a splash of water or vinegar. If glaze too thin, simmer uncovered to concentrate, but watch for burning or bitterness. A classic balance of sweet, tart, savory with a slick finish on meat surface."
tips:
- "Start with garlic; minced for strong flavor. Fresh onions add sharpness. No oil needed to sauté – sugars release naturally from ingredients. Pour balsamic, brings deep tang. Keep it simmering – avoid boiling. Watch for darkening color, glossy texture builds slowly. Stir often without over-mixing cherries."
- "Cherries can pop while cooking; visual changes don't need pureed bits. Thickness checks crucial. Coat the back of a spoon; when it clings just right you’re near. Remember to whisk cornstarch slurry well for no lumps. Gradually drench sauce; keep stirring. Then low heat to activate thickener."
- "A splash of water brightens too-thick glaze. Or if too thin? Simmer until concentrated. Texture shifts from watery to syrupy—watch carefully—no one wants burned bits. Fresh cherries preferred, but thaw frozen and drain properly to control consistency. Maple syrup here, but sugar/honey could work in a pinch."
- "Swaps matter too. Red onion gives bite, but even shallot or green onion can stand in. Garlic powder, if fresh isn't handy, one-third the amount. Quality balsamic makes a difference; cheap can taste harsh. Don't skip the water, or else glaze sets up thick and unmoving."
- "Make ahead? Warm gently, adjust with water as needed. Stirrers at the ready, lumps happen. The warm glaze over ham? It’s transformative. Massive flavor complexity. Aroma alone fills a room. Serve thick enough to adhere but not flood the plate with excess glaze."
