ingredients:
- "2 tablespoons olive oil"
- "1 medium yellow onion, diced"
- "3 cloves garlic, finely minced"
- "1 roasted poblano pepper, seeded and chopped"
- "1 teaspoon ground cumin"
- "1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika"
- "1 chipotle pepper in adobo, chopped"
- "1/2 teaspoon sea salt, or to taste"
- "1 15-ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed"
- "1 4-ounce can diced green chiles"
- "3 cups vegetable broth, low sodium"
- "Queso fresco or crumbled cotija for garnish"
instructions:
- "Heat olive oil in heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium. Wait for shimmering glisten but no smoke. Toss in diced onion. Stir gently, listen for soft sizzle. Saute about 6 minutes. Look for onions to turn translucent, edges just losing white opacity; avoid any color, no caramelization needed. Add minced garlic. Stir quickly. Garlic must sweat but never brown — about 90 seconds. Now in go chipotle pepper, cumin, roasted poblano, smoked paprika, and salt. Stir to coat evenly. The mixture should start smelling smoky and earthy. Add broth immediately to stop spices burning."
- "Bring liquid to a gentle simmer, tiny bubble bursts around pan edges. Reduce heat slightly. Let contents simmer for 18 minutes. No rolling boil. You want flavors to marry but beans and pepper to stay robust, not disintegrate. Remove from heat. Use immersion blender directly or transfer carefully to blender jar. Purée until velvety but retaining slight texture — not paper-thin. If too thick, add a splash of broth or water. Return soup to pan and heat back to medium-low."
- "Add drained black beans and diced green chiles to soup base. Gently fold in. Heat through for 6 minutes, stirring once or twice. Beans warming but not falling apart, chiles soft but still chunky. Adjust salt after tasting; acidity and smoke should balance. Don’t over-salt or overpower chipotle’s heat."
- "Serve piping hot. Ladle into bowls. Top generously with queso fresco or cotija. The crumbly saltiness cuts through smoky richness. Offer lime wedges and chopped cilantro if available to add freshness and zing."
- "Optional twist: add a dollop of Greek yogurt or avocado on top for creaminess without drowning flavors."
introduction: "Not your average black bean soup. Starts with building depth in the base—onions sweated, not browned—because brown means bitterness in this context. Garlic quickly joins, releasing its aroma without developing harshness. Chipotle brings smoky fire; combined with roasted poblano for a milder, earthy undertone. Spice powders—cumin and smoked paprika—layer the flavor. Keeping broth low sodium lets you control seasoning instead of chasing salt later. Puréeing isn’t about silky smooth; rough creaminess holds character. Beans and chiles added last to keep their shape intact. Topping with queso fresco adds a sharp, cool crunch. The kind of soup best served with crusty bread and a loud kitchen."
ingredientsNote: "Olive oil is your neutral fat here, but avocado or grapeseed oil works if you want a lighter profile. Yellow onion brings sweetness; white onion will do but expect sharper bite. Roasted poblano replaces canned green chile for fresher, smoky heat—use canned if pressed. Chipotle can be swapped with a chipotle powder or smoked ancho chili if you lack adobo peppers. Black beans must be rinsed well to strip can starch; dried beans soaked overnight yield better texture but need longer cooking. Vegetable broth keeps it vegetarian; chicken broth adds depth if you prefer. Queso fresco is traditional; cotija or even feta can stand in. Cumin and smoked paprika can be adjusted to taste—omit paprika for less smokiness or swap with mild chili powder if needed."
instructionsNote: "Start by heating oil enough to shimmer but avoid smoking—that ruins flavor. Saute onion until edges just turn transparent; that means sugars released, flavor softened. Don’t rush this stage—undercooked onions taste raw, overcooked become bitter. Garlic adds punch but burns fast—stir constantly and lower heat if you see darkening. Adding spices early allows bloom in fat but horrible if left too long—adding broth rescues burnt spices. Simmering gently, check for tiny bubbles, no vigorous boil. Over-boiling breaks down beans and spices, muddling flavors. Use immersion blender directly in pot to save washing, but be cautious to cool slightly or risk splatters. Purée to texture preference; a rough blend gives personality. Reheat gently—beans can mush otherwise. Add beans and chiles last to maintain structure. Serve immediately. Garnish fresh to balance smokiness and richness. For leftovers, flavors intensify; add a splash broth when reheating to loosen."
tips:
- "Heat oil until just shimmering for balanced flavor. Avoid smoking—burnt oil alters taste. If you see smoke, start again. Adjust heat while sauteing onions; translucent is key. Not brown, no bitterness. Taste testing spices? A spoon can help; trust your palate for seasoning."
- "Garlic burns fast. After adding, stir constantly. Smell as it releases aroma—stop when fragrant. Not browned. For creaminess, use less broth at blending. Reblend later if needed. For thicker soup, purée less. Prefer chunky? Pulse lightly in blender. Texture is essential here."
- "Poblanos add great depth, but ensure they’re roasted well. Store extras for salads, tacos. Onion sweetness can be swapped; shallots work, but flavors differ. Rinsing beans reduces starch. Rinsed canned beans yield smooth soup, dried beans take longer. Plan ahead if using dried."
- "Adjust salt after adding beans. Balance chipotle’s heat and depth. Over-salting masks other flavors; less is more. Fresh lime at serving brightens—all freshness counters richness. Consider cilantro for an herb note—adds a bright kick."
- "Leftover storage? Refrigerate, allow flavors to meld. Add splash of broth or water when reheating to restore consistency. Freezing? Portion into bags, label well, last few months. Defrost in fridge overnight before warming. Soup thickens as it cools."
faq:
- "q: What if soup is too thick? a: Add broth slowly while heating. A splash at a time; adjust to preference. Blend again if needed for texture. Chunkiness is better; keep some beans whole."
- "q: Can I use dried beans? a: Yes, soak overnight first. Adjust cooking time—longer simmer needed. Check tenderness regularly. Might change texture slightly, still delicious. Fresh flavors may shine more with dried."
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Refrigerate quickly to maintain quality. Last up to 4 days. Freezing is an option too; portion for easy reheating. Do not freeze with garnishes; add them just before serving."
- "q: What if I can’t find roasted poblanos? a: Use canned green chiles instead, but flavor is milder. Can roast regular peppers in oven until skin is blackened. Just adjust roasting time due to size."
