ingredients:
- "=== DRESSING ==="
- "135 ml (1/2 cup plus 1 tbsp) light coconut milk"
- "24 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) almond butter"
- "12 ml (3 tsp) tamari sauce"
- "8 ml (1 1/2 tsp) finely grated ginger"
- "1 small garlic clove, minced"
- "12 ml (2 tsp) rice vinegar"
- "4 ml (3/4 tsp) agave syrup"
- "4 ml (3/4 tsp) chili garlic sauce"
- "=== SALAD ==="
- "280 g (10 oz) tempeh, diced"
- "36 ml (2 1/2 tbsp) avocado oil"
- "180 g (1 3/4 cups) grated carrots"
- "170 g (1 3/4 cups) mung bean sprouts"
- "25 g (3/4 cup) fresh cilantro leaves"
- "Roasted pumpkin seeds, to sprinkle"
- "Lime wedges, to serve"
instructions:
- "=== MAKING THE DRESSING ==="
- "1. Whisk all dressing ingredients in a small saucepan. Heat gently, bring to a boil, whisk constantly. Remove from heat once bubbling. Let cool. Reserve 100 ml (about 1/2 cup) separately for plating. Pour the rest into a large mixing bowl."
- "=== PREPPING THE TEMPEH ==="
- "2. Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium-high. Add avocado oil. Toss tempeh cubes in, cook 6-7 minutes until edges golden and crisp, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper while cooking. Drain on paper towels. Set aside."
- "=== ASSEMBLING THE SALAD ==="
- "3. Into the big bowl with dressing, add grated carrots, mung bean sprouts, and cilantro. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Toss thoroughly to coat evenly. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed."
- "=== FINAL ASSEMBLY ==="
- "4. Divide salad into serving bowls or plates. Top with warm grilled tempeh. Scatter pumpkin seeds over top. Drizzle reserved coconut dressing. Serve with lime wedges on side. Add a scoop of steamed jasmine or basmati rice to complete the meal."
introduction: "Tempeh cubes fried crispy, coating them in a thin layer of oil. Carrot shreds ready to soak up spice and cool coconut cream. Bean sprouts add crunch underneath. Tangy lime for a last-minute zing. Cilantro piles on herb freshness. Peanut butter switched for almond for a twist. Sriracha replaced with chili garlic sauce. Dressing heated to bloom flavors. Blend the sweet, salty, and spicy in one bowl. Protein-packed, vibrant, vegan, and nut-free options. Quick searing. Salad tossed with warmth. Crunchy seeds instead of peanuts. Simple, robust flavors that don’t fade."
ingredientsNote: "Light coconut milk keeps dressing creamy but not heavy. Almond butter replaces peanut to avoid nuts, but smoothness stays. Tamari used instead of soy for richer umami, less salt. Chili garlic sauce brings a deeper chili flavor without overpowering sweetness. Grated carrots provide moisture and a subtle sweet crunch, balanced by the fresh burst of mung bean sprouts and soft cilantro leaves. Avocado oil lends a neutral frying base with a gentle fruity note, perfect for tempeh searing. Pumpkin seeds instead of peanuts add unique texture and nutty crunch, suitable for nut-allergic diners. Lime wedges freshen the palate last-minute. Tempeh diced smaller for faster cooking. All tailored for easy prep with a small shift in flavor."
instructionsNote: "Whisk dressing in a small saucepan, gentle heat to avoid coconut separating. Boil briefly to meld flavors but don’t overcook. Reserve just under half for plating to keep dressing both on salad and as a dip. Pan-fry tempeh on medium-high so cubes crisp but don’t burn or dry out. Lift off with paper towel quickly to keep crisps intact. Combine carrots, sprouts, and herbs directly in the dressing bowl for uniform flavor coating. Season at each step, remembering tamari adds saltiness so balance accordingly. Final plate layering aims for contrast: salad moist and soft, tempeh crispy, seeds crunchy. Serve promptly with rice or grain to absorb extra dressing and balance richness."
tips:
- "Heat coconut milk gently. Too hot? It separates. Whisk constantly while it warms. Cook briefly to combine flavors, don’t boil too long. Chill slightly. Save half for dressing later."
- "Tempeh needs time. Cut into small cubes for quick cooking. Medium-high heat is key. Crisp exterior with soft inside. Season early for taste. Pat it dry after cooking."
- "Dressings matter. Adjust according to taste. Too tangy? Add more agave. Prefer spice? Extra chili sauce works. Balance sweet, salty, and spicy. It’s all about contrast in every bite."
- "Always add fresh herbs. Cilantro brightens flavors. Makes everything feel lighter. Throw in some lime juice for zing. Even a pinch can uplift the dish. Fresh is crucial."
- "Serving suggestion - pair with rice. Jasmine or basmati adds texture. Absorbs dressing perfectly. Complements crunchy salad. Makes it a complete meal. Filling but not heavy."
faq:
- "q: What's the best way to store leftovers? a: Keep in an airtight container. Fridge works well. Consume within 2-3 days for best flavor. Dressing separates after a while."
- "q: Can I use something instead of tempeh? a: Yes, try chickpeas or roasted tofu. Both add protein. Texture will change but flavors still shine. Experimentation is key."
- "q: How to modify for spice lovers? a: Chili garlic sauce is strong. Add more if desired. Try fresh sliced peppers. Or sprinkle red pepper flakes for extra heat."
- "q: Are there nut-free options? a: Yes, swap almond butter for sunflower seed butter. It’s creamy too. No nuts at all, enjoy pumpkin seeds for crunch. Perfect substitute."
