ingredients:
- "300 ml green lentils"
- "1 medium onion"
- "4 cloves whole"
- "1 bay leaf"
- "80 ml olive oil"
- "4 shallots finely chopped"
- "70 ml dry white wine"
- "zest of 1 lemon"
- "50 ml fresh thyme leaves"
- "1 kg salmon fillet"
- "20 ml honey"
- "20 ml panko breadcrumbs"
- "salt and black pepper"
- "1 small garlic clove minced"
- "10 ml Dijon mustard"
instructions:
- "In a pot, put lentils, onion pierced with cloves, bay leaf, garlic, 20 ml olive oil, salt, pepper. Cover with water, bring to simmer, cook about 20-25 minutes till lentils just tender. Drain, remove onion and bay leaf."
- "While lentils cook, warm 60 ml olive oil in pan, soften shallots gently. Splash white wine, high heat, reduce by half. Add lemon zest and thyme leaves. Toss lentils in. Cook 2-3 minutes. Keep warm."
- "Preheat broiler high. Place salmon on baking tray lined. Combine honey and Dijon, brush over fish. Sprinkle with panko. Broil 6-8 minutes depending on thickness, watch carefully. Fish should flake slightly but still moist."
- "Slice salmon into portions, place over lentils on plates. Season with more pepper if desired. Serve immediately."
introduction: "Lentils soaking up garlic, cloves, bay leaf, and wine. Aromatic steam drifting. Salmon glazed with honey, that quick broil gives crunch and softness at the same time. Basil swapped for thyme, Dijon mustard added for sharpness. Simple ingredients tangled into layers. Cooking times shifted, lentils take a bit longer this way to absorb flavors fully. No fuss plating, the fish sliced, sitting on a bed that’s herbal, earthy, lightly soured from zest and wine. Olive oil pulls it all together. Rustic, reasonable, fast enough for weeknights but good enough for guests. A quiet twist where mustard plays with sweet and acidity, breadcrumbs turned panko for crunch. No dairy, no eggs, no nuts, clean."
ingredientsNote: "Lentils increased slightly to soak more flavor from herbs and aromatics. Onion is pierced with cloves for subtle spice, bay leaf remains for earthiness. Olive oil bumped up so lentils stay glossy and rich. Shallots finely chopped, not sliced, melt easier in pan. White wine reduced to bring sharper edge. Thyme replaces basil, more savory tone. Garlic minced in lentils for depth and a touch lively kick. Dijon mustard introduced to honey glaze for a tangy contrast against salmon’s richness. Panko crumbs replace Italian-style bread crumbs, add crisp crunch and lighter texture under broiler. Salt and pepper essential but adjusted with care since mustard adds saltiness. Lemon zest stays for brightness and slight citrus aroma to enliven the mix."
instructionsNote: "Start lentils with aromatics in cold water salted well to let flavors infuse slowly. Watch them closely after 20 minutes, aim for firm tenderness, not mush. Remove whole onion and bay leaf to avoid bitterness. In separate pan, soften shallots low and slow, then crank heat for rapid wine reduction, extract essence quickly, then add lemon zest and thyme to create fresh herbal layer. Mix lentils back into that pan to finish flavor melding. While lentils settle and keep warm, prep and broil fish. Mustard mixed with honey spreads easily, delivers sweet and sharp blend, panko laid evenly, watch closely under broiler for 6-8 minutes depending on thickness — faster if thin. Fish should lift easily, have that caramelized top. Cut salmon carefully to preserve shape. Serve immediately over herb-lentil bed, seasoned to taste, no drizzles needed but optionally add extra pepper or lemon wedges for punch."
tips:
- "Start lentils in cold, salted water. Infuse flavors slowly. Watch timing after 20 minutes. Aim for firm but tender, not mushy. Season well."
- "Shallots need a gentle touch. Heat low to soften. Then increase heat for wine reduction. Quick, pulls essence out fast. Keep it aromatic."
- "When broiling, monitoring is a must. Salmon cooks quickly under high heat. Aim for 6-8 minutes depending on thickness. Look for that flaking."
- "Use a good quality olive oil. Helps keep lentils glossy. Add plenty to shallots too. Balances flavors. Enhance richness and texture."
- "Taste throughout cooking. Adjust salt and pepper cautiously. Dijon mustard adds saltiness. Balance it with lemon zest for freshness."
faq:
- "q: How long to cook lentils? a: Usually 20-25 minutes. Check for tenderness. Drain after cooking. Remove onion and bay leaf for clean taste."
- "q: Can I use different fish? a: Absolutely. Any firm fish works. Think cod or trout. Just adjust cooking time based on thickness."
- "q: What's the best way to store leftovers? a: Store in airtight containers. Fridge for 2-3 days. Reheat gently to avoid drying out."
- "q: Can I use canned lentils? a: Yes, but not ideal for soaking flavors. If using, rinse well. Reduce cooking time significantly."
