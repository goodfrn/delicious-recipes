slug: "broccoli-cheese-soup"
description: "A creamy broccoli soup built from scratch. Onion sweated till translucent, garlic softened but not burnt. Butter roux thickens broth, milk swapped for half-and-half. Broccoli cooks till tender, cheese melds off heat. Uses gouda for nuttiness, fontina for melt. Focus on balance of sharp and creamy. Avoid scorch by stirring, watch for bubbling to gauge thicken. Controls salt by broth choice. The texture rich but not gluey thanks to precise flour cook time and low simmer. Practical, hands-on tweaks for everyday cook, substitutions noted for dairy and broth. Yield feeds 7-9 easily, satisfying meal."

ingredients:
- "4 tablespoons unsalted butter"
- "1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped"
- "3 garlic cloves, minced"
- "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour"
- "4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth, warmed"
- "2 cups half-and-half"
- "1 cup heavy cream"
- "4 cups broccoli florets, chopped"
- "1 cup shredded smoked gouda cheese"
- "1 cup shredded fontina cheese"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste"
instructions:
- "Melt butter in a heavy-bottomed 4-5 quart pot over medium-high heat. Listen for soft sizzle, foam settling signals just right."
- "Add chopped onion. Cook uncovered, stirring often. Watch for translucent, soft texture—no browning. Takes about 5-6 minutes. Raw onion flavor ruins mouthfeel here."
- "Turn heat to medium-low. Toss in garlic, stir constantly, smell the raw edge soften but no color changes. About 1-2 minutes max. Garlic burns fast, bitter."
- "Sprinkle flour evenly. Stir constantly to form roux without lumps. Cook 1-1.5 minutes until raw flour taste gone. Dry roux prevents grainy soup but no darkening."
- "Pour in warmed vegetable broth gradually. Whisk immediately to break clumps. Then add half-and-half and cream, combining fully. Smooth liquid shifts from thick to velvety and luscious."
- "Lower to low heat. Keep stirring occasionally. Look for gentle bubbles at edges, soup thickens steadily—do not boil. Boil breaks dairy, grainy texture."
- "Add broccoli florets. Cook uncovered, stirring every few minutes to avoid scorching bottom. Broccoli should soften yet hold shape around 12-15 minutes; color brightens green but no mush."
- "Take pot off heat. Stir in shredded gouda and fontina cheeses until melted and creamy. Cheese melts best off direct heat to keep texture smooth, no separation."
- "Season with salt and pepper last. Taste broth first—low-sodium broth needs some salt, too much kills balance."
introduction: "Broccoli cheese soup, a classic comfort—brown butter flavor missing too often, but that’s the secret foundation. Start by sweating onions till translucent, never browned; keeps color clean and taste deep. Garlic added late to avoid bitterness. Roux with flour and butter builds body—not just thickening but giving that rich mouthfeel. Milk replaced here with half-and-half for creaminess without heavy weight; cream added for silkiness. Broccoli’s timing crucial: cook until tender but not mushy, vibrant green as visual cue. Finishing off with smoked gouda and fontina gives a layer of complexity beyond cheddar—adding smoky nuttiness and creamy melt. Stir cheese off heat for texture, prevent stringy or oily mess. Don’t neglect seasoning; few broths bring salt, so adjust at end. This approach nails texture, taste and reliability.—knowing when to stir, when to watch, and when to pull from heat named kitchen essentials."
ingredientsNote: "Butter choice affects flavor—unsalted preferred to control salt. Onion finely diced releases flavor without big chunks; yellow onion provides sweet undertones over raw sharpness. Garlic mashed or minced finely prevents hard bits, introduces aroma. All-purpose flour as thickening agent; cook long enough to remove raw taste but not brown, important to avoid bitterness and grainy texture. Broth swap to vegetable keeps soup lighter and vegan adaptable; chicken broth gives more depth if preferred. Half-and-half balances richness and pourability; whole milk too thin, cream alone overly thick. Heavy cream adds luxurious mouthfeel but cutting by time or quantity saves calories and reduces fat without sacrificing silkiness. Broccoli structural integrity keeps soup attractive; florets uniform size for even cooking. Gouda and fontina cheeses chosen for melt and flavor—smoked gouda offers smoky complexity, fontina melts creamy with mild flavor, unlike sharper cheddars that can overpower or clump—if unavailable, provolone plus mozzarella works."
instructionsNote: "Sweating onions slow at medium-high heat breaks down layers releasing sweetness without color. Constant stirring avoids tough edges, ensures even cooking. Garlic added later to prevent bitter burnt notes, stirred continuously but briefly. Flour incorporation key—sprinkle evenly, form roux, avoid lumps by stirring constantly. Cook roux until raw raw taste evaporates, about a minute longer than flour first hits pan; smell and texture shift are guides. Broth poured in warmed to avoid shocking roux and clumping; whisk briskly. Dairy added with broth to temper thickening and avoid scorching on bottom. Heat lowered before simmering keeps dairy proteins intact—no curdling. Broccoli cooked just long enough to soften but retain texture, stirring prevents sticking and burning. Cheese off heat melts smoother due to residual heat—high heat breaks fat emulsions causing graininess or separation. Seasoning last because salt in cheese and broth varies, tasting prevents over-salting. If soup too thick, loosen with more broth or half-and-half; too thin, simmer gently longer. Monitor pot bottom for scorching risks; thick soups grab faster with dairy present. Use heavy-bottomed pot for even heat distribution."
tips:
- "Key to flavor lies in onions. Sweat them long. Soft and translucent. Avoid browning; bitterness ruins broth. Listen for that gentle sizzle, foam tells you heat's right."
- "Don't underestimate garlic; add it late. Cook just enough to soften; smell changes, raw edge fades. Watch heat—burnt garlic ruins sweetness. Less time than you think."
- "Roux takes patience, sprinkle flour evenly. Stir constantly to avoid lumps. Important to cook out raw taste. A minute longer once flour hits pan; smell and texture guide you."
- "Broth warmed first; shocking roux with cold causes clumps. Pour gradually. Whisking is essential—smooth sauce is silky; clumpy ruins the rich vibe."
- "Add broccoli last; timing crucial. Want tender yet firm. Vibrant color not mushy. Stir regularly, prevent sticking. Look for bright green; visual cue for 'done'"
- "Cheese off heat is crucial; melts better, avoids separation. Watch for texture—too high heat breaks creamy emulsion. Stir in slowly to keep everything smooth."
faq:
- "q: What broth to use? a: Low-sodium is best. Vegetable for lighter soup. Chicken broth for depth. Adjust salt at end; varies by broth. Check flavor."
- "q: Can I skip cream? a: Yes, half-and-half alone works. But mouthfeel less rich. Reducing cream is an option if looking for lightness. Balance flavors."
- "q: Soup too thick? a: Add more broth or half-and-half. Stir gently to integrate; can also simmer longer to thicken. Watch heat—dairy can scorch."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Single serving containers; keep chilled in fridge. Reheat gently, low heat. Freeze in airtight containers; use within 3 months."
