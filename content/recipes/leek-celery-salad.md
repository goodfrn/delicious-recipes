ingredients:
- "4 medium leeks trimmed and halved lengthwise"
- "4 celery stalks cut into 3 inch pieces"
- "260 ml (1 cup) chicken stock or vegetable stock"
- "1 sprig fresh thyme"
- "1 bay leaf"
- "1 whole clove"
- "60 ml (1/4 cup) apple cider vinegar"
- "1 egg yolk"
- "7 ml (1 1/4 tsp) Dijon mustard"
- "60 ml (1/4 cup) extra virgin olive oil"
- "1/2 tart green apple, cored and thinly sliced on mandoline"
- "Salt and cracked black pepper"
- "Optional: pinch of smoked paprika"
instructions:
- "Set oven rack mid-level; preheat to 175° Celsius (345° Fahrenheit)."
- "Trim dark green tops off leeks; halve pale green and white parts crosswise to manageable pieces."
- "Arrange leeks and celery in roasting dish in a single layer. Pour stock over. Add thyme, bay leaf, clove. Season lightly with salt and pepper."
- "Cover tightly with foil to trap moisture; bake 25 minutes, or until leeks feel tender when pierced with a skewer but not mushy. Celery should have a bit of snap left."
- "Lift vegetables carefully onto plate; let cool slightly. Strain braising liquid through fine sieve or cheesecloth into small saucepan."
- "Add vinegar to 75 ml (1/3 cup) of strained broth; reduce gently over medium heat until about 40 ml remains, watching carefully to avoid burning. It should coat spoon thinly but not become syrupy. Let cool to warm."
- "In bowl, whisk yolk with Dijon until smooth. Slowly drizzle oil in steady stream, whisking vigorously to make creamy emulsion. Incorporate warm vinegar reduction gradually. Season with salt, pepper, and optional smoked paprika if desired."
- "On serving plates, arrange wedges of cooked leek and celery with raw apple slices interspersed for crunch and acidity. Spoon vinaigrette over evenly without drowning vegetables."
- "Serve slightly cooled or at room temperature. Leftovers keep well refrigerated but vinaigrette may firm; whisk before serving."
introduction: "Leeks coaxed into softness without losing shape; celery kept crispy but tender. Braising in stock infuses background flavor, aromatics lift it subtly—the thyme woody, bay leaf slightly bitter, clove warming. The vinegar-broth reduction cut by egg yolk and oil brings balance; the dressing clings to the vegetables, enriching their humble texture. Crisp green apple slices break monotony—fresh acidity, juicy snap, a little sweetness. Swap chicken stock for vegetable if vegan or skip clove if unfamiliar. Keep an eye on the broth reduction; too thick turns pasty and too thin dilutes flavor. Timing reluctant; feel the stalk give and leaf soften before pulling from the oven. Don’t overdress. This starter is smart, restrained, but layered. No fuss. No excess. Just technique."
ingredientsNote: "Leeks—the base—must be cleaned well, dirt lurks between layers. If no mandoline, thin knife slices suffice but unevenness changes texture contrast. Celery’s braise time shortened for snap; use fennel for more assertive licorice notes. Olive oil quality matters here—fruitier oils build complexity. Egg yolk binds vinaigrette; skip and whisk mustard with yogurt or silken tofu as a non-egg alternative. Apple cider vinegar’s sharpness tempered by broth; lemon juice can sub with harsher acid. The broth should be low-sodium or unsalted to better control seasoning later. Occasionally, dashi or mushroom broth create umami depth for vegetarian variations."
instructionsNote: "Oven braise instead of stovetop simmers space and reduces monitoring but foil covering is non-negotiable to trap steam and avoid drying vegetables. The broth reduction amplifies flavor but watch heat carefully to prevent bitterness from caramelized vinegar. Whisking egg yolk with mustard stabilizes oil addition, preventing broken vinaigrette. Pour oil very slowly at first—emulsion forms easier. Vinaigrette temperature trick—warm liquid better incorporates egg yolk; too hot cooks yolk. Incorporate apple last to maintain crispness; add just before serving or fruit turns mushy. Leftover braised vegetables work well chilled in salads or pureed. Remind: texture is everything here. Check tactility throughout cooking. Assert seasoning. Don’t rush."
tips:
- "When cleaning leeks, cut lengthwise. Rinse between layers, dirt hides well. Trim tops; don’t waste the white part. Can save for stocks. Use a mandoline for consistent apple slices. Or just a sharp knife—keep ’em thin for crunch. Celery must stay crisp—don’t overbraise. Watch timing."
- "Watch the broth reduction closely. Medium heat is key. Too much heat burns, too low dilutes flavors. Should coat the back of a spoon, not syrupy. Always taste broth pre-seasoning; season lightly. Better control with low-sodium stock to avoid over-salting. Adjust as needed."
- "Blending egg yolk into the dressing is essential. Must whisk vigorously—slow oil drizzle helps emulsify. If splits, don’t panic—start with a new yolk emulsion. Slowly whisk in the split dressing. Temperature matters, warm broth integrates better. Too hot, yolk scrambles."
- "To store leftovers: keep vinaigrette separate. Otherwise, veggies go soggy. Can repurpose braised leeks in other dishes, maybe a frittata or puree them for soup. Just refrigerate well. Extra stock can help revive dryness if veggies lose moisture."
- "To make it vegan, ditch the yolk and use silken tofu instead. Blend with vinegar, then whisk in oil. Swap apple cider vinegar for lemon juice if needed. Adds brightness. Fennel sub for celery gives a bright flavor twist. Experiment with herbs too."
faq:
- "q: How to know leeks are done? a: Feel for tenderness with a skewer. They should give but not mushy. Celery intact—bit of snap still. Look for color change too, pale green should show."
- "q: Can I skip the vinegar reduction? a: Yes, but it loses depth. Use fresh lemon juice mixed with broth instead. Adds acidity but different flavor. Try it, see what fits."
- "q: What if the dressing breaks? a: Start another emulsion, whisk yolk and mustard over low heat. Gradually mix in the split dressing slowly—emulsifying action restores it. Also, temperature matters—keep warm."
- "q: How about freezing leftovers? a: Not recommended, dressing separates poorly. Store veggies in portions; reheat gently in a pan. Better texture that way. Adjust seasoning if needed post-heating."
