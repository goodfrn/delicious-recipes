ingredients:
- "2 large multicolored bell peppers halved and seeded"
- "3 medium zucchini cut into 1.2 cm (1/2 inch) slices"
- "70 ml (1/3 cup) extra virgin olive oil"
- "3 cloves garlic finely minced"
- "1 large red onion sliced into rings"
- "120 g crumbly fresh chèvre (goat cheese)"
- "40 ml (2 tbsp) finely chopped fresh basil leaves"
- "Salt to taste"
- "Freshly ground black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Fire up grill to high heat; clean grates to avoid stick."
- "Combine peppers, zucchini with oil and garlic in a mixing bowl. Toss until glossy and fragrant. Season evenly with salt and pepper."
- "Lay veggies directly onto grill surface. Listen for sharp hissing. Leave undisturbed 5–7 minutes until skin blackens and blisters. Flip carefully with tongs; repeat until tender but still holding shape. Avoid overcooking, no sogginess."
- "Slide onion slices into a grill-safe pan or cast iron skillet placed over hot grill. Cook undisturbed about 8 minutes, stirring once, until translucence and caramelized edges develop."
- "Remove all charred vegetables; let cool slightly on a plate. Chop into bite-size chunks."
- "Arrange grilled vegetables and onions in a shallow serving bowl. Crumble goat cheese over top generously. Sprinkle with fresh basil. Grind pepper freshly."
- "Serve immediately. Eat warm or room temp. Holds a few hours fridge tightly covered but best fresh."
- "Substitution: Feta cheese stands in for chèvre with salt adjustment. Shallots can replace onions if milder flavour suits. If no grill, pan-roast veggies, but watch heat to replicate char and crisp edges."
introduction: "Grilling peppers and zucchini transforms their texture and flavor dramatically. Those blistered skins crackle slightly as they soften, releasing smoky sweetness. Here, garlic-infused olive oil bastes everything, amplifies aromatic layers. Red onion caramelizes to add a rich umami note, a counterpoint to the fresh, crumbly tang of goat cheese that melts barely on warm veggies. Fresh basil scattered last turns fragrance bright, green and herbal. Timing’s loose; watch veggies color shift. The goal isn’t mush but tender with bite. A straightforward salad that pairs with grilled meats but also stands proud solo on lighter evenings. Substituting feta or shallots shifts notes but keeps essence intact. No fluff. Just real-ingredient roasting mastery. Good, rustic, no fuss."
ingredientsNote: "Adjust pepper count if smaller or larger, aim for about two cups chopped total. Zucchini slices thick enough to hold up but thin enough for char. Olive oil is crucial—extra virgin for flavor and smoke point balance; sub any neutral oil if sensitive to smoke. Garlic fineness critical here—too big chunks can burn and become bitter. Goat cheese needs to be fresh and crumbly not aged hard logs—melts into bites rather than overpowering with sharpness. Basil best fresh; dry won’t do. Onions: if you want sweeter, soak rings briefly in cold water before grilling to temper raw harshness. Kitchen hack: if no grill, hot cast iron pan works but tends to lack smoky char flavor; add a drop of smoked paprika to oil for partial illusion."
instructionsNote: "Grilling peppers and zucchini: patience is key. Let them hit the hot grill and blister undisturbed—plenty of smoke and sizzle cues when time to flip. Flip gently to preserve flesh. Onions caramelize differently—use a pan to avoid them falling through grates, stir carefully once or twice. Overcooked onions turn mushy; look instead for translucency bordered by rich brown edges that offer crunch contrast. Crumbling cheese last ensures it doesn’t melt fully into a puddle, preserving texture and tang on hot but not scorching veggies. Basil uses: add last step off heat, any earlier loses aroma quickly. Salt should be balanced carefully to lift all components without drowning freshness. Serve immediately while still warm to best experience harmony of char and creaminess. Salvage tip: if veggies cool too much, reheat briefly on grill but watch closely—cheese will melt too much and lose crumbly character. Timing varies with grill heat, so rely on visual cues."
tips:
- "Patience. Don't rush the grilling. Let veggies sit. Wait for the sizzle. A hot grill means better flavor. Colors change. That's your cue."
- "Use fresh basil. Dried doesn’t cut it. Adds brightness. Wait until the end to sprinkle. Keeps aroma intact. More flavor in fresh."
- "Vary the sizes of zucchini slices. Too thin? They’ll burn. Too thick? Won't cook through. Aim for balance. Texture matters."
- "Watch for garlic. Mince finely. Toss quickly with veggies. Large pieces burn. Too bitter. Adjust garlic amount if unsure."
- "If using feta, adjust salt. Goat cheese tangier. Test taste after mashing. Don’t overpower fresh flavors with salt. Less is more."
