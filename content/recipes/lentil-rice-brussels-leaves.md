ingredients:
- "1 medium onion chopped"
- "1 stalk celery finely diced"
- "2 cloves garlic minced"
- "60 ml 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil divided"
- "200 g 1 cup Puy or green lentils rinsed drained"
- "500 ml 2 cups vegetable broth or chicken broth"
- "375 ml 1 1/2 cups tomato purée"
- "5 ml 1 teaspoon dried thyme"
- "5 ml 1 teaspoon smoked paprika"
- "3 ml 1/2 teaspoon celery salt"
- "1 pinch cayenne pepper to taste"
- "125 ml 1/2 cup basmati rice rinsed"
- "15 g 1/3 cup fresh parsley chopped"
- "650 g about 5 cups Brussels sprouts leaves, cleaned"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Heat half oil in large skillet medium-high heat. Sauté onion, celery, garlic until translucent edges start curling 4–5 minutes. Watch for no browning, sweat to soften and release aroma."
- "Add lentils, broth, tomato purée, thyme, smoked paprika, celery salt, cayenne, salt, pepper. Stir. Bring to rapid simmer with lid tilted. Once bubbling, reduce heat to low. Simmer 12 minutes till lentils slightly tender but not mushy."
- "Stir in rinsed basmati rice. Cover tight; cook on low 18–22 minutes. Rice grains should be tender but with modest bite. If too firm add splash water and increase heat briefly; too mushy means overcooked."
- "Remove from heat. Let rest 7 minutes uncovered. Moist steam continues cooking gently. Fluff with fork, fold in parsley. Adjust seasoning."
- "Meanwhile arrange Brussels leaves on two parchment-lined trays. Toss with remaining olive oil, salt, pepper. Roast middle oven at 205°C 400°F until crisp edges golden 10–13 minutes. Rotate trays halfway for even color."
- "Serve lentil rice mound topped with warm roasted Brussels leaves. Contrast creamy base with crunchy green just before plating to maintain texture."
introduction: "Forget complicated. Lentils and rice, basics that stretch well, swell with flavor when coaxed right. Browning the aromatics softens their bite, juices release aromas that lift the pot. Simmer not stew, keep the rice a little toothy or it’s all mush which nobody likes. Thyme and smoky paprika swap oregano and dry mustard for earth and warmth. Switching vegetable broth behind chicken broth keeps it plant-friendly but underlines the depth you want from good broth. Brussels leaves stripped and roasted, not boiled, crackle and char, adding a sharp textural snap. No fuss layering flavors, timing is all. While the lentils cook, the oven does the heavy lifting with the greens. Timing overlap. Relax. Then feast."
ingredientsNote: "Use green lentils if Puy isn’t available; they take a bit longer but hold shape well. Basmati rice chosen for fluffy grains—long grain white or jasmine work but note cooking time adjustments. Broth concentration matters—too weak and it dulls the dish; rich broth elevates it. Thyme and smoked paprika replace oregano and dry mustard for a woodsy warmth and subtle fire, but cumin or coriander could stand in for different profiles. Brussels leaves—only the leaves, ripped off, not the whole sprouts—roasted on parchment prevents sticking and promotes crisp edges. Olive oil split into two uses to prevent overcrowding pan early on and toasting leaves later. Celery salt helps layer the allium flavors better than regular salt alone, unsung hero here."
instructionsNote: "Sweat aromatics gently—avoid browning to keep sweetness pure, not bitter. Lentils added before rice because they take longer, simmer uncovered but watch liquid level constantly, add splash water if drying out; lentils need moisture but you want thick mix not watery. When rice gets added, don’t stir, cover tightly to trap steam, timing matters, or you’ll get gluey grains. Resting uncovered lets moisture escape and improves texture. Roasting Brussels leaves alone on baking trays keeps them crisp and evenly browned; crowding leads to sogginess. Flip trays midway for control. Serve immediately after roasting to keep contrast with lentil-rice softness. Season salt and pepper last to avoid tough lentils or watery greens. If pressed for time, roast Brussels while lentils simmer—keeps workflow tight."
tips:
- "When sautéing, don’t let garlic brown; burn can ruin flavor. Sweat onions and celery till clear, soft. Constant stirring helps. Water released in veggies adds aroma as well."
- "Use Puy lentils for best texture; if out, green lentils work. Just add a few more minutes cooking time. Rinse well before using. They'll hold shape better; no mushy mess."
- "Don’t stir when adding rice. Traps steam needed for cooking. Check rice at end by tasting. If firm, add splash water, raise heat briefly. Overcooked = gluey."
- "Adjust spices. Smoked paprika adds depth, can swap for regular but chill on the heat. Always taste while cooking; build flavor gradually. Finishing with fresh parsley brightens."
- "Roasting Brussels goals: crisp edges, golden color. Preheat oven thoroughly. Check midway, rotate trays. Crowd them on the tray? Soggy disaster. Use parchment to help with crisping."
faq:
- "q: How to ensure lentils are cooked right? a: Check texture often. Should be tender but still holding shape. No mush. Taste them at 12 minutes."
- "q: What if I don’t have enough broth? a: Water can sub in emergency, but broth’s depth matters. Too weak? Dish will lose character."
- "q: Storing leftovers, how? a: Refrigerate. Airtight container. Keep Brussels separate; they won’t last well. Reheat but add fresh crunch on top later."
- "q: Need to speed up cooking? a: Prep Brussels while lentils simmer; saves time. Just keep an eye on both. Consider microwave for greens but texture suffers."
