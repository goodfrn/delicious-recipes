title: "Broccoli Bacon Quiche"
slug: "broccoli-bacon-quiche"
description: "A savory baked tart with a flaky homemade crust filled with tender broccoli, smoky bacon, sautéed onions, and a rich custard infused with melty mozzarella and sharp aged cheddar. Time-tested technique for a crisp base and a creamy interior with balanced seasoning. Practical substitutions include turkey bacon or smoked tofu for bacon and whole wheat pastry flour for a nuttier crust. Work fast with cold butter, chill dough thoroughly, and watch the crust edges—golden means done. Avoid soggy bottoms by blind baking the shell with weights. Recognize doneness by firm, set center and browned cheese topping. Ideal for weeknight dinners or brunch."

ingredients:
- "===Crust==="
- "350 ml (1 ½ cups) all-purpose flour"
- "100 ml (⅓ cup plus 1 tbsp) cold unsalted butter, diced"
- "90 ml (6 tbsp) ice water, add gradually"
- "Pinch fine salt"
- "===Filling==="
- "3 strips thick-cut smoked bacon, chopped"
- "25 ml (1 ½ tbsp) olive oil"
- "1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced"
- "900 ml (3 ¾ cups) broccoli florets, roughly chopped"
- "1 large clove garlic, minced"
- "10 ml (2 tsp) cornstarch"
- "280 ml (1 ⅛ cup) 2% milk or whole milk"
- "4 large eggs"
- "125 ml (½ cup) shredded mozzarella"
- "125 ml (½ cup) shredded aged cheddar"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "===Crust==="
- "1. Blend flour and salt in food processor, pulse to combine. Scatter cold butter cubes over flour mixture. Pulse several times in brief bursts. Butter should look like coarse peas; avoid warming it up or overprocessing—textural quality depends on it. Stop when only a few pea-sized pieces remain with crumbly flour."
- "2. Slowly drizzle ice water in while pulsing lightly. You want dough to just hold when pressed—not wet or sticky. If too dry, add 1 tsp water at a time. Remove dough, gather quickly but don’t overwork. Form thick disk. Wrap in plastic and chill for minimum 45 minutes. Letting it rest solidifies gluten and firms butter chunks for better flake."
- "3. Preheat oven to 210°C (410°F) with rack positioned on low level. Roll dough on lightly floured board, shape into 28 cm (11-inch) circle. Transfer gently to 24 cm (9.5-inch) quiche dish. Trim excess, fold edges under and crimp or press decoratively. Chill again 15 minutes to prevent shrinking."
- "4. Line crust with parchment paper; fill with dried beans or pie weights. Blind bake for about 20 minutes until edges show light golden hue. Remove weights and paper carefully—don’t tear crust. Bake another 5–7 minutes. Crust will firm but not fully brown yet. This controls sogginess from custard filling."
- "===Filling==="
- "5. Heat olive oil in skillet over medium heat. Toss in chopped bacon, cook until crisp with audible sizzle, about 6 minutes. Scoop out bacon using slotted spoon, leave rendered fat with pan drippings."
- "6. Add sliced onion; stir often, cook until translucent and edges have light caramel color but not burnt, about 7–9 minutes. Toss in broccoli and garlic; sauté until broccoli is bright green and tender-crisp, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat."
- "7. Evenly spread vegetable and bacon mixture across par-baked crust."
- "8. In medium bowl, whisk cornstarch into cold milk thoroughly—prevents lumps, thickens custard gently. Add eggs, beat just enough to combine. Stir in mozzarella and cheddar. Season with salt and fresh black pepper."
- "9. Pour custard mixture over filling firmly pressed down. Tap dish lightly to remove air bubbles. Bake at reduced temperature 175°C (350°F) for 30–40 minutes. Quiche is ready when center is set but wobble disappears, cheese has golden patches. Don’t overbake or custard will shrink and crack."
- "10. Rest quiche on wire rack 10–15 minutes before slicing. Cooling lets custard stabilize for clean cuts."
introduction: "Flaky pastry meets dense, creamy egg custard. Broccoli holds shape, adds subtle crunch. Bacon renders fat for flavor uplift; swap with smoked tempeh for vegetarian pivot—just crisp thoroughly. Blind baking is key—crisp shell beats soggy disaster every time. Mozzarella offers gooey stretch, T sharp cheddar counters richness. Texture contrast, flavor balance with minimal fuss. Chill dough well; warm butter kills flake world. Know crust done by golden edges, slightly pulling away from pan sides. Egg custard jiggle tells doneness, not stopwatch. Cooking smells tell story: bacon crackles, onions sweeten, broccoli sharpens aroma. A kitchen rhythm to master—timing, sensory signals over rigid timers. For crust, cold water reluctantly added; over adding means sticky mess, under adding, crumbly shards. Simple technique but results depend on reading dough and custard, not clock."
ingredientsNote: "Butter must be cold and cubed; warmth ruins flakiness. All-purpose flour works best for structure, but 25% whole wheat adds nutty notes and fiber; avoid bread flour here—too much gluten toughens. Water should be ice cold to keep butter chilled through dough formation. Fat content in milk influences custard richness; full-fat milk or cream can replace but scale back cheese slightly to avoid greasy mouthfeel. Bacon choice affects salt and smoke intensity; thick slices render well but adapt cook times if using thinner. Mozzarella is mild; stronger aged cheddar offsets with tang and bite. Cornstarch distributes thickening evenly; skip for runnier filling but risk seepage into crust. Onions caramelized add sweetness balancing earthiness from broccoli; yellow onions preferred. Substitutions: turkey bacon, smoked tofu, kale instead of broccoli, or par-cooked frozen broccoli."
instructionsNote: "Food processor critical for rapid butter-flour mixing; hands work if pressed but risk warming dough, toughening crust. Be vigilant on butter size; pea-sized chunks bake into crisp pockets—no butter lumps, no dry dough. Resting dough twice essential to relax gluten and firm shape; skipping leads to shrinking and tough crust. Blind baking with weights prevents bubbling and ensures crisp base; dried beans or rice work fine—just reusable. Watch crust edges; shield if browning too fast with foil strips. When cooking bacon, low to medium heat renders fat without burning; sweat onions in bacon fat for flavor depth, avoid dark browning as it leads to bitterness. Broccoli stir until tender but firm; overcook, lose texture. Whisk cornstarch well into cold milk first—prevents clumps and prevents settling. Custard texture firm yet creamy, bake with door closed for stable oven temp. Rest cooling sets custard neatly; cut with sharp serrated knife. Quiche is versatile; double filling if doubling crust, but monitor baking times carefully. Store leftovers refrigerated, reheat gently to preserve texture."
tips:
- "Cold butter really matters. Dice and chill well. Overheat ruins flakiness. Use a food processor for best blend; quick mixes ensure butter stays solid. If hands only, work fast."
- "Watch blind baking closely. Take care not to burn crust edges. Remove parchment slowly to keep crust intact. Look for golden edges, not dark brown. Key for crisp bottom."
- "Broccoli should stay firm, bright green, not mushy. Quick sauté—3 minutes tops. Add salt and pepper early; flavor blooms, enhances. Adjust bacon choice for less salt if needed."
- "Cornstarch in milk is crucial. Whisk fully to prevent lumps. This thickens custard gently. If skipping, risk watery filling. Sometimes it’s not worth the gamble."
- "Resting is vital. Let quiche cool a bit before cutting. Stabilizes texture; slices come out clean. Savor the bacon aroma, onion sweetness, and cheesy top as dish cools."
faq:
- "q: How to prevent a soggy crust? a: Blind bake—those weights matter. Check edges for light color but not too dark. Don’t skimp on chilling dough beforehand."
- "q: Can I substitute bacon? a: Yes, try turkey bacon or smoked tofu. Adjust cooking times if using thinner bacon. Keep flavors in check. Smoked tempeh is another option."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Store in an airtight container. Can refrigerate for 3–4 days. Reheat gently, avoiding microwave if possible to keep texture."
- "q: What's the key to a nice custard? a: Blend milk and eggs well. Don’t forget the cornstarch. Set oven temp correctly. Watch for jiggle while baking. Timing varies."
