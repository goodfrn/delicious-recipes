ingredients:
- "135 ml ketchup"
- "75 ml apple cider vinegar"
- "50 g brown sugar"
- "30 ml spicy grain mustard"
- "30 ml Worcestershire sauce"
- "30 ml smoked paprika and cumin blend"
- "10 ml onion powder"
- "5 ml chipotle sauce"
- "2.5 ml garlic powder"
- "1.6 kg boneless pork shoulder, cut into 8 chunks"
instructions:
- "Pour ketchup, cider vinegar, brown sugar, spicy mustard, Worcestershire, smoked paprika-cumin mix, onion powder, chipotle sauce, garlic powder in pressure cooker. Stir to combine well."
- "Add pork chunks and toss to coat thoroughly. Salt and pepper over meat. Cover with lid locked. Set pressure cooker to meat function, 35 minutes cook time."
- "Once timer ends, let pressure naturally release about 20 minutes. Open lid carefully. Remove pork to bowl, shred meat finely with forks, trimming visible fat."
- "Switch pressure cooker to sauté mode. Simmer sauce to reduce to half volume, about 15 to 25 minutes. Sauce should be syrupy."
- "Return shredded pork to cooker bowl, stir well so pork is drenched in sauce. Adjust salt and spice if needed. Serve hot, alongside corn bread, polenta or sandwich rolls."
introduction: "Chunks of pork shoulder. Drenched in thick, spicy tangy sauce. Pressure cooker does the heavy lifting, cuts cooking time by half. Ketchup and cider vinegar mix base. Brown sugar adds depth, smoky paprika and cumin bring earthiness and warmth replacing chili seasoning. Chipotle sauce swaps out Tabasco for a smokier punch. Garlic and onion powders balance flavors. Cook quickly under pressure, natural release keeps meat moist. Sauce goes back in, reduced to sticky glaze. Pulled pork with bite. No dairy, gluten, nuts, or eggs. Simple sides like corn bread or creamy polenta keep it rustic."
ingredientsNote: "Swapping Dijon for spicy grain mustard brings more bite, deeper flavor. Smoked paprika and cumin instead of chili seasoning gives smoky warmth, less heat but complexity. Chipotle sauce instead of Tabasco adds smoke and subtle heat, complements smoked spices better. Brown sugar quantity slightly reduced to balance increased acidity from extra vinegar. Onion and garlic powders kept lower to not overpower smoky, spicy notes. Meat size standard at 1.6 kg shoulder, boneless and trimmed keeps fat manageable. Sauce quantities adjusted proportionally for thicker coating and better reduction. All ingredients allergy friendly—no nuts, gluten, dairy, eggs."
instructionsNote: "Start with mixing all sauce elements well before adding meat, ensures even coating. Toss meat chunks fully in sauce, let them marinate briefly if time allows. Pressure cook for 35 minutes, a bit shorter than standard to avoid overcooking but enough for tender pull apart. Natural release critical—reduces toughness, keeps juices inside meat. Shred carefully with forks, trim any excess fat after cooking for cleaner texture. Sauté mode reduction takes 15-25 minutes depending on cooker power; watch closely for syrupy consistency. Toss shredded pork back with sauce fully to impart flavor into every bite. Adjust seasoning last—salt, spice, vinegar balance with taste. Serve immediately, or keep warm on low sauté. Sides should absorb sauce well."
tips:
- "Always mix sauce well before meat goes in. Helps in even coating. Meat chunks should soak in flavors. If there's time, marinate."
- "Natural release is a must. It makes meat tender. Leaves flavors intact. About 20 minutes is good. Keeps moisture, avoid toughness."
- "Shred pork carefully. Use two forks. Trim fat for better texture. Saucing after shredding also adds flavor. Be generous with sauce!"
- "Sauce reduction varies by appliance. Keep an eye on it. Aim for syrupy. 15 to 25 minutes in sauté mode. Adjust thickness to preference."
- "Taste adjusts seasoning last. Salt and spice balances flavors. Add vinegar if needed to kick up acidity. Sides should absorb this sauce."
faq:
- "q: How do I store leftover pulled pork? a: Fridge keeps well for 3 to 4 days. Freeze leftovers for longer. Reheat gently in a skillet."
- "q: What if my pork is tough? a: Try cooking a bit longer next time. Adjust natural release time. Too quick might lead to texture issues."
- "q: Can I use other cuts of pork? a: Yes, tenderloin works. Might need less time, tougher cuts need longer. Just keep an eye on doneness."
- "q: Best sides to serve with? a: Cornbread is classic. Polenta works too. Consider pickles, coleslaw, add crunch. Balance flavors well."
