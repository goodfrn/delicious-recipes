description: "Apple tart with reduced sugar and butter. Mixed apple types swapped: Cortland replaced with Granny Smith, McIntosh switched for Honeycrisp. A splash of lemon juice added to filling, vanilla extract swapped in crust for vinegar. Dough chilled 25 minutes. Baking temp lowered to 210°C, bake 30-40 minutes. Crust made flaky with pinch of cornstarch. Filling cooked longer for caramelization. Rim sealed tightly, star-shaped vents cut on top crust. Lactic milk used for brushing. Yields 8 servings, classic French-style tart reworked with fresh twist in texture and flavor."

ingredients:
- "=== Apple Filling ==="
- "45 ml butter"
- "175 ml sugar"
- "2.5 litres Granny Smith apples peeled, each cut into 8 wedges (8-10 medium)"
- "500 ml Honeycrisp apples peeled, each cut into 8 wedges (2 medium)"
- "1.5 ml ground cinnamon"
- "15 ml fresh lemon juice"
- "=== Crust ==="
- "375 ml all-purpose flour unbleached"
- "125 ml cornstarch"
- "1 ml salt"
- "200 ml cold unsalted butter diced"
- "90 ml chilled water"
- "5 ml vanilla extract"
- "45 ml milk for brushing"
instructions:
- "=== Apple Filling ==="
- "1 Use heavy pan. Melt butter, add sugar. Stir 1.5 minutes to start caramel."
- "2 Add apples, cinnamon, lemon juice. High heat, stir often 12 minutes. Apples soften, start breaking down, liquid syrup almost gone. Remove from heat. Cool completely."
- "=== Crust ==="
- "3 Combine flour, cornstarch, and salt in food processor. Add butter cubes. Pulse until pea-size pieces form."
- "4 Add chilled water and vanilla. Pulse until dough starts to hold together but still crumbly."
- "5 Shape dough into two discs, wrap in plastic. Refrigerate 25 minutes minimum."
- "=== Assembly and Baking ==="
- "6 Preheat oven to 210°C (410°F). Place rack lower third of oven."
- "7 Flour surface lightly. Roll one disc to fit 23 cm tart pan with 2.5 cm sides. Press dough into pan gently."
- "8 Spoon cooled apple filling in center, pile slightly high but leave edges clear."
- "9 Roll second disc. Cut 5 star holes (using small cutter) evenly spaced."
- "10 Cover filling with second crust, aligning edges. Press edges firmly to seal, pinch with fingers or fork."
- "11 Brush crust with milk for golden color."
- "12 Bake 30-40 minutes or until crust turns deep golden and firm."
- "13 Let cool until warm to touch. Serve slightly warm or room temp."
- "14 Store at room temp up to 3 days. Longer refrigeration toughens crust."
introduction: "Apples chunked. Butter melting. Sugar carmelizing. Cinnamon hits the pan with fresh lemon tartness. Granny Smith swapped in for tart bite, Honeycrisp bursts of sweetness mish-mashed softening but still holding shape. Dough mix chunky with cornstarch for extra flake. Vanilla in crust, no vinegar now. Dough chilled less but firm. Roll, cut stars for vents - cut corners, why not? Milk brush for color glow. Oven hotter, bake time tweaked. Cooling not ignored. Crisp crust, tender filling. Texture contrast. A simple tart, rethought. You don’t need fancy. Work fast, think fresh. Apple tart like that."
ingredientsNote: "Butter quantity reduced slightly; sugar slashed by about 30% for less cloying sweetness. Switched apple types to balance tart and sweet differently—Granny Smith for sharpness replacing Cortland. Honeycrisp swapped for McIntosh, less mushy in cooking. Added lemon juice for slight puckering bright note. Cornstarch added to crust ingredients for flakiness and to absorb some moisture from filling. Vinegar dropped, replaced by vanilla to add subtle aroma and soften dough taste without acid bite. Milk used instead of just water for brushing, aiding golden browning. Measurements converted and rounded for simpler handling."
instructionsNote: "First, caramelize butter and sugar carefully; timing extended to 90 seconds to develop deeper flavor without burning. Apples pushed longer on heat until breakdown but not puree, aiming for mix of soft and slightly intact pieces. Cooling is key; hot filling ruins dough. Dough processed to pea size chunks and pulse just right to avoid overworking—brief pulse until mixture comes together. Chilling shortened for easier handling. Roll dough gently to keep air pockets, critical for flaky crust. Venting on top crust changed from round holes to stars for aesthetics and better steam release. Oven temp dropped slightly, bake time extended a bit to prevent overbrowning. Milk wash applied just before baking, skipping egg wash for dairy-free edge but still golden. Let tart cool till warm but not hot for best slicing—settles filling and firms crust."
tips:
- "Choose apples carefully. Granny Smith gives a nice tartness. Honeycrisp holds shape better. Mixing varieties balances flavors. Color and texture contrast adds depth."
- "Chill dough for better flakiness. Dough should be crumbly but hold together. Brief pulse in food processor avoids overmixing. Keep air pockets for more rise."
- "Rolling out? Keep flour handy. A light dusting on the surface prevents sticking. Roll gently to maintain thickness. Aim for even layer across the base."
- "Venting holes not just practical. Star shapes? They add visual appeal. Don't forget to brush with milk for that golden finish. Looks matter in baking."
- "Cooling time is essential. Hot filling can ruin the crust. Allow it to settle before cutting. Warm is great for flavor but not too hot."
faq:
- "q: What types of apples work well? a: Granny Smith is for tartness. Honeycrisp has sweet bursts. Mix for contrast. Avoid mushy types like McIntosh."
- "q: Can I use another crust? a: Sure. Shortcrust or pastry might work. Look for something flaky. Baking time could change."
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Keep at room temp not in fridge. It toughens crust. Cover loosely to avoid drying out. Enjoy within three days."
- "q: What if my filling is too watery? a: Cook it longer on heat first. Aim for syrupy consistency. Need thick? Add more cornstarch in the mix."
