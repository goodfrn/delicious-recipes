ingredients:
- "280 ml spelt flour"
- "180 ml fine semolina"
- "1 teaspoon salt"
- "180 ml hot vegetable broth"
- "Fine semolina for dusting"
- "250 g cherry tomatoes, halved"
- "2 tablespoons olive oil"
- "A handful fresh basil leaves, torn"
- "Salt and pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Start with mixing spelt flour, semolina, and salt in a large bowl or food processor."
- "Pour the hot vegetable broth slowly—liquid should be steaming—mix until dough just starts coming together. Hot broth activates gluten differently, giving the dough subtle elasticity."
- "Turn dough onto lightly floured surface. Knead firmly for minimum 7 minutes by hand or 4 minutes in a stand mixer with dough hook. Proper gluten development gives that rustic chewiness. Dough should feel supple, not sticky. If sticky, sprinkle tiny semolina while kneading."
- "Divide dough into two equal parts. Wrap one half tightly with plastic wrap to prevent drying."
- "Roll out remaining dough into a rough 15 cm wide rectangle about 3 mm thick. Don’t fuss about perfect edges; rustic means variable."
- "Use a sharp knife to cut into strips approximately 3 mm wide and about 15 cm long. If strips stick, dust lightly with semolina. Avoid flour here; semolina adds grit and grip."
- "Optional but traditional: on unfloured surface, roll each strip with fingertips, pressing slightly to round the edges. It’s tactile—feel the dough thin out without breaking."
- "Lay strands separately on a semolina-dusted tray or board. Toss gently in more semolina to coat and guard against sticking during rest."
- "Let the pasta rest at room temperature for 30 minutes if making ahead; speeds cooking and keeps shape intact."
- "While pasta rests, heat olive oil in skillet over medium heat. Add halved cherry tomatoes, season lightly with salt and pepper. Stir frequently; skins will soften, some juice releases—aroma intensifies. Cook about 4-5 minutes, tomatoes break down but keep slight texture."
- "Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add pici; stirring occasionally to stop strands clumping. Fresh pasta cues: they’ll bob to surface, slightly swollen, but still firm to touch—about 7 minutes cooking time."
- "Drain pasta reserving a ladle of cooking water. Toss pici in skillet with tomatoes, add torn basil leaves. Splash some pasta water to coat strands; adds smooth silkiness without heaviness."
- "Finish with a drizzle of olive oil, taste, adjust salt and pepper as needed."
- "Serve immediately, maybe more basil on top. No cheese here—keep it clean, bright, herbaceous."
introduction: "Dough tricky? Keep it hot, keep it patient. Semolina gives that tooth, spelt adds a rustic nuttiness flavor-wise and texture-wise. Water swapped for broth adds faint umami. Rolling rough cuts? Perfect. No machines. No fuss. Roll with fingers, slight pressure, not crushing. Fresh pasta softens fast in boiling water. Cook long enough for tenderness but still firm—listen for tender bounce and flicker on surface. Toss in separately cooked tomatoes, bright fresh basil. That’s your twist—lightness and fresh punch. No dairy. No fuss. Simple pantry pantry pantry."
ingredientsNote: "Spelt flour works better here than plain all-purpose if you can get it—more chew, better flavor, holds shape under boiling. Semolina fineness is key; gritty semolina for dusting keeps pici strands separate without clumping. Vegetable broth warmer than plain water helps starter gluten activation and adds subtle aroma. Cherry tomatoes can be swapped with small plum tomatoes or even slow-roasted if you want sweetness concentrated. Basil optional but recommended for that herb burst. Olive oil is non-negotiable—finishes pasta and cooking tomatoes with a richness that balances acidity."
instructionsNote: "Mix dry first, then add hot broth carefully—too cold or too hot will change dough behavior. Knead until elastic but still soft; dough should be tacky but not sticky. Cut uniformly but don't obsess about perfect bands—rustic means uneven size helps hold sauce differently. Rolling each strip smooth removes sharp edges that can tear during cooking. Pasta needs immediate semolina dusting or risk sticking—don't skip this classic step. Cook pasta in plenty of boiling salted water; the pici will float up when nearly done; test by biting—should offer slight resistance, not mush. Save cooking water for sauce—starchy liquid binds flavors in pan. Tossing warm tomatoes rather than mixing cooked ingredients lets fresh herbs keep bright. Season last—always adjust salt at the end. Avoid overcooking tomatoes—they should burst but retain shape to contrast pasta texture."
tips:
- "Keep pasta moist while rolling. Not too thick or too thin. If dough tears, gently patch it; glue it together with a pinch of water."
- "Adjust water temperature. Non-steaming broth means less gluten activation. Keep it hot; improve elasticity for that coveted chew."
- "Kneading matters greatly. Develop strength—remember, keep it firm. Use semolina during kneading if it gets too tacky. Check texture."
- "Pasta sticking? Dust more semolina. Avoid flour; keeps strands separate. Transfer carefully onto trays. Let rest if making ahead."
- "Tomatoes too juicy? Bake before sautéing. Concentrate sweetness; adds depth. Skip cooling after. Hot to hot, fresh herbs added last."
faq:
- "q: How do I know when the pasta is done? a: Watch it closely—pici should float. Test bite—should resist slightly but not hard."
- "q: Can I substitute the spelt flour? a: Yes, all-purpose flour works fine, but lose some nuttiness in texture. Try durum for a firmer bite."
- "q: What if my tomatoes fall apart? a: Don’t panic. Keep stirring—get those juices flowing. Can add a splash of broth to bind."
- "q: How to store leftover pasta? a: Keep covered in fridge for two days at most. Reheat quickly in boiling water. Another option—freezing under semolina."
