description: "Rich brown sugar dough folded with chopped caramel chocolates. Combines melted butter for chew, brown and white sugars for balance. Vanilla and eggs beaten light for texture. Flour sifted with baking soda and salt to keep dough airy. Rolos chopped to uneven chunks, melting in pockets during bake. Baked low and slow on parchment-lined insulated sheets. Edges turn just toasted, centers soft and gooey. Transfers cool gently to avoid breaking. Sweet, salty, caramel bursts with milk chocolate. Stretch times slightly depending on oven type. Substitutions and tips included for common kitchen setups."

ingredients:
- "1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour"
- "1/2 teaspoon baking soda"
- "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt"
- "3/4 cup unsalted butter melted, cooled"
- "1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar"
- "1/3 cup granulated sugar"
- "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract"
- "1 large egg"
- "1 large egg yolk"
- "1 cup chopped caramel chocolates (Rolos or substitute chopped caramel-filled chocolates)"
- "Optional twist: 1/4 cup chopped roasted pecans or walnuts"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 320 degrees Fahrenheit. Use insulated cookie sheets or line regular pans with parchment paper to avoid burnt bottoms."
- "Sift together flour, baking soda, and salt. Ensures even leavening and stops salt clumps that can unevenly season dough."
- "In stand mixer or large bowl, blend melted butter with both sugars. Cream until mixture looks thick, grainy, and slightly glossy. Avoid over-creaming; melted butter doesn't aerate like softened butter."
- "Beat in vanilla, egg, and yolk until combined and texture shifts to lighter cream color with some volume. Stop mixing to prevent tough dough from overworked gluten."
- "Add sifted dry ingredients in two parts, folding gently just until flour disappears. Overmixing develops gluten—chewy, but can be dense."
- "Fold in chopped caramel chocolates and optional nuts by hand. Avoid stirring too aggressively, caramel pieces should stay intact to melt in pockets."
- "Portion dough with a 2-tablespoon scoop spaced 3 inches apart on parchment. Dough will spread, avoid crowding to keep edges defined."
- "Bake 13 to 18 minutes. Watch cookie edges—when lightly toasted and centers still soft and shiny, pull out. Don't wait for cookie to firm up in oven or risk dry texture."
- "Let rest 5 minutes on pan, then gently shift to cooling racks using a thin spatula. Cookies are fragile hot; rushing breaks warm centers."
- "Adjust bake time ±2 minutes for convection ovens or if using thicker cookie sheets. If bottoms burn quickly, switch baking surface or reduce temp by 5-10 degrees."
- "Substitutions: Use unsalted butter or add an extra pinch salt if salted. Brown sugar may be light or dark for flavor variation. Swap caramel chocolates with chopped toffee bars or caramel-filled chocolates."
- "Additions: Mix in toasted pecans, walnuts, or even a sprinkle of flaky sea salt on top pre-bake for a twist. Watch salt quantities, it shifts sweetness balance."
- "Troubleshooting: Dough too soft? Chill 15-30 mins. Cookies spreading too much? Add 1-2 tbsp flour or chill dough before baking. Caramel chunks melting too much? Chop larger for visible bites."
- "Storage: Cool completely, store airtight at room temp up to 3 days or freeze individual dough balls before baking. Bake from frozen adding +1-2 minutes."
introduction: "Brown sugar caramel candy pieces folded into butter-rich dough. Melted butter for chew but cool before mixing so eggs don’t cook. Vanilla eggs beaten enough to lighten but not break structure. Sift flour and leaveners to keep texture open. Rolos chopped unevenly for bursts of gooey caramel. Oven temp a bit lower than usual for gentler baking, edges just toasted, centers still slightly under. That’s the sweet spot. Almost underdone but set. Parchment on insulated pans to stop scorching. Cookies want room to spread, so space dough well. Cool gently or centers break like glass. Substitutions for butter types or caramel candies included, with nuts as a simple twist. Watch dough softness and chilling times for best result. Practical kitchen guidance over fluff. The method shapes texture, flavor, bite. No guesswork beyond knowing your tools and dough."
ingredientsNote: "Butter is melted for chew—depending on your stove, use unsalted to avoid over salty batches. Dark brown sugar brings caramel depth, but light brown also works, shifting taste lighter. Sizes and brands of caramel chocolates vary; chop unevenly for best texture contrast. Nuts optional but add crunch and contrast well with soft caramel. Flour measured by weight preferable but level with spoon if no scale. Sifting dry ingredients avoids pockets of salt or uneven rising. Substitute baking soda with baking powder if nothing else, but changes rise dynamic slightly. Eggs at room temp mix better and hold air more evenly, so pull out ahead of time. Parchment preferred; silicone mats can alter bottom browning, so adjust heat if using."
instructionsNote: "Preheat and bake temperatures always need adjustment based on your oven’s hot spots; trust visual and tactile clues—edges should just brown, but centers wobble slightly when you jiggle the pan. Melted butter and sugar cream differently—don’t overbeat or eggs will scramble or gluten will develop too tough. Folding chocolate by hand keeps chunks intact—more stirring risks melting into dough prematurely, losing the surprise bites. Dough spread controlled through spacing, chilling dough if too loose. Cooling on pan five minutes lets structure set; moving hot cookies risks crumbling. Use thin spatula to transfer, lift flat. Watch for burnt bottoms—a tell you need to lower temp or insulate baking sheet. Baking times fluctuate based on dough size and pan material; visually judge doneness rather than timer. Store in airtight container or freeze dough balls for fresh baking on demand."
tips:
- "Keep those Rolos unevenly chopped. Small chunks can melt completely, leaving you with no caramel surprise. Larger pieces give texture."
- "Watch your baking time. Visual cues matter. Once edges are lightly toasty, pull them out even if they seem too soft at center."
- "Experiment with sugars. Use either dark brown or light brown. Each brings a different depth, adjust based on preference."
- "Dough too sticky? Chill it. Fifteen minutes helps firm it up. Enough time to add flour if needed. Don't skip this."
- "Cooling cookies on pan is essential. Let them settle five minutes, prevents breaking. Gentle handling key for warm cookies."
faq:
- "q: Why are my cookies flat? a: Dough too warm could be the issue. Chill the dough, or add a bit more flour. This helps fight spreading."
- "q: Can I use salted butter? a: Yes, but be cautious with added salt. Position in the balance. Adjust if necessary for the sweet-salty combo."
- "q: How do I store leftover cookies? a: Airtight container at room temp keeps them fresh. For longer storage, freeze unbaked dough. Thaw before baking."
- "q: What if I don't have brown sugar? a: Swap with granulated sugar, works fine. Will slightly alter flavor, but cookies will still hold up."
