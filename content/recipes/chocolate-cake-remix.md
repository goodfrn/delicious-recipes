- "5 ml (1 tsp) cream of tartar"
- "600 ml (2 1/2 cups) sugar"
- "180 ml (3/4 cup) vegetable oil"
- "200 ml (3/4 cup plus 2 tbsp) buttermilk"

- "1.25 liters (5 cups) icing sugar"
- "10 ml (2 tsp) dark rum"
- "1 ml (1/4 tsp) instant coffee granules"
instructions:
- "===Cake==="
- "Position oven rack center. Preheat oven 5 minutes less than usual at 175 ˚C (347 ˚F)."
- "Line two 23 cm (9 in) springform pans with parchment. Butter and flour lightly."
- "Sift flour, cocoa, and baking soda. Set aside."
- "Beat eggs with cream of tartar and sugar at high speed about 7 minutes till volume doubles but not stiff peaks."
- "Slow speed in, oil, buttermilk, and almond extract. Mix dry ingredients fast but just combined."
- "Divide batter evenly in pans. Bake 55 minutes or until toothpick clean with slight crumbs. Cool on wire rack."
- "Cut each cake horizontally into two layers once cool enough."
- "===Simple Syrup==="
- "Boil sugar and water until sugar dissolves fully, about 2 minutes. Cool."
- "===Chocolate Frosting==="
- "Whip cream cheese, oil, cream, icing sugar, rum, and instant coffee till creamy and spreadable."
- "Assembly"
- "Brush syrup evenly over each cake layer—drench but don’t puddle."
- "Spread frosting on each layer, stacking carefully. Cover top and sides smoothly or rustic."
- "Chill at least 1 hour before serving."
introduction: "Eggs folded thick. Sugar whisked hot till doubled. Flour is cocoa rich. Oil and buttermilk bring softness. Substitute vanilla with almond. Baking soda replaces powder for a twist. Frosting takes cream cheese, adds rum and coffee granules for depth. A soak of sweet syrup. Layers sliced thinner, stacked high. Oven time trimmed five minutes. A little less heat. Still moist. The taste shifts, a more complex note. Chocolate dense, yet airy. Sips of almond unexpected. The rum teases."
ingredientsNote: "Flour reduced by about 30%. Cocoa lowered slightly too to balance almond extract and coffee. Baking powder swapped with soda for tender crumb and better rise. Vanilla changed out; almond brings a nutty fragrance instead of traditional warmth. Frosting, classic butter replaced by cream cheese, makes tangy richness and better hold. Dark rum and a bit of instant coffee boost flavor complexity, give a deep edge with subtle bitterness. Sugar quantities adjusted down a bit on cake and syrup to keep sweetness balanced with these stronger accents. Measurements adapted from cups to metric for accuracy."
instructionsNote: "Oven preheat shortened to save time and avoid over-baking. Mixing eggs & sugar lasted 7 minutes, just shy of full peak; want volume without stiffness. Dry ingredients need quick folding to keep aeration, but don't overmix or dry. Bake 5 minutes less than original for moist crumb. Cool on racks to avoid soggy bottom. Cut cake layers horizontally once cool for thinner strata—this helps syrup soak better, prevents heavy slices. Syrup boiled briefly, just to dissolve sugar; let cool before brushing to avoid melting frosting or cake layers. Frosting whipped until creamy, then add rum and dissolved coffee granules last to not break emulsion. Assembly requires brushing syrup on each layer carefully, soaks evenly but no pools. Cover entire cake with frosting; rustic or smooth finishes both good. Chill minimum hour for set cake. Slice with hot knife recommended for neat cuts."
tips:
- "Chill your ingredients. Warm eggs whip better. Cold buttermilk helps overall batter. Room temperature gives a lift to cake. Separation of ingredients vital."
- "Brush syrup on layers. Not too much. Just soak enough. Thinner layers absorb better. Prevent sogginess. Cake retains moisture with just the right touch."
- "When mixing eggs and sugar, be patient. High speed at first, then slow in oil and buttermilk. Overmixing can deflate volume. Keep aeration crucial."
- "Cutting cake layers once cool gives stability. Use a serrated knife. Angle it slightly. Thin layers create a beautiful look. Easier to frost, too."
- "Monitor baking time. Oven varies. Toothpick test must have slight crumbs. If over-baked, the cake dries out. Five minutes less ensures moist crumb."
faq:
- "q: How long can cake store? a: Up to five days in fridge. Wrap it well. Keeps moisture intact. Room temperature for two days okay."
- "q: Can I substitute ingredients? a: Sure, but get creative. Different extracts fit well. Coconut or vanilla. But keep the fat ratio similar."
- "q: What if my frosting is too runny? a: Add more icing sugar gradually. Whisk until thicker. Can chill briefly to firm up as well."
- "q: What's the best way to slice the cake? a: Use a hot, sharp knife. Wipe between cuts. Keeps layers neat. Avoid tearing through frosting."
