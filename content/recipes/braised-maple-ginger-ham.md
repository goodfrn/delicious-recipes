ingredients:
- "1 large onion, thinly sliced"
- "3 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped"
- "1 piece fresh ginger about 3 cm (1 1/4 in), washed and sliced"
- "1/2 serrano pepper, seeds removed or left in, cut into thin rings"
- "20 ml (1 tbsp plus 1 tsp) vegetable oil"
- "800 g (1 3/4 lb) boneless smoked ham"
- "600 ml (2 1/2 cups) water"
- "300 ml (1 1/4 cups) maple syrup"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) low sodium tamari (optional substitute for soy sauce)"
instructions:
- "Set pressure cooker on high heat using sauté mode. Add oil, toss in onion, garlic, sliced ginger, and serrano. Cook briefly until onion softens, about 3 minutes."
- "Pour in water, maple syrup, and add tamari. Place ham in liquid. Seal lid securely. Select meat setting, adjust to 50 minutes."
- "When timer ends, allow natural pressure release for roughly 20 minutes. Open lid carefully."
- "Fish out ginger slices and discard. Slice ham on cutting board against grain."
- "Serve with boiled root vegetables or potatoes. Alternatively, store ham with sauce in sealed container, let cool slightly, refrigerate."
introduction: "Ham that soaks in maple and ginger sweet heat. Pressure cooker cuts wait but builds layers. Onion, garlic, serrano kick sharp notes, sliced ginger gives fresh punch. Sweet syrup thickening sauce with watery broth. Slow pressure melds smoke and spice. Remove fiery spikes before serving. Cool and serve with plain sides. Store leftovers for days. Endless repeat meals. No fuss. Just punchy savory sweet balance."
ingredientsNote: "Onion and garlic base gives foundation. Fresh ginger key to zing, thicker slices release flavor during cooking but easy to fish out. Serrano pepper replaces jalapeño, a sharper heat, seeds adjustable for spice. Oil quantity slightly increased to help sauté soften aromatics faster. Ham size nudged up, water and maple syrup amounts bumped to keep good braise level, ensuring liquid covers most ham. Low sodium tamari option for soy sauce, milder and gluten-free alternative if needed."
instructionsNote: "Begin with sauté mode to wake up ingredients, short 3-minute sauté flushed with oil, not brown. Add liquids and ham after to avoid burning. Slightly longer meat setting at 50 minutes for this larger ham piece ensures tenderness and full absorption of flavors. Natural pressure release preferred to keep meat juicy. Ginger removed after cooking to stop getting too bitter. Slice against grain for ease. Serve or refrigerate with sauce to lock moisture and depth. No stirring while cooking to keep meat intact."
tips:
- "First, always sauté garlic and onion in oil. It adds flavor but do not brown too much. Just enough to soften them. Ginger slices strong. Small or thick. Either works, discard later."
- "Water is crucial. Keeps ham moist. Maple syrup brings the sweet punch. Adjust ratios for smaller or larger hams. Lock flavor by packing in liquid, cover meat well."
- "Natural pressure release important. Locks in juices, makes ham moist. Slice against the grain for tender bites. Easy to chew. Serving ideas, root veggies go great. Store in sealed container."
- "Serrano spice can kick up flavor. Adjust seeds based on heat preference. Plan for leftovers, refrigerate with sauce. Keeps meat tender and flavorful. Perfect for meals later."
- "Tamari option for soy sauce. Gluten-free choice. Milder flavor. Experiment with spices during prep. Add more or less to fit your taste. Always taste sauce before serving."
faq:
- "q: What to do if ham is tough? a: First slice against the grain. Then try pressure cooking longer. Not all hams are same. Some need more time."
- "q: How long can I store leftovers? a: Store in fridge for about 3-5 days. Consider freezing for longer life. Remove sauce for quicker reheating. Keep in airtight containers."
- "q: Can I use a different meat? a: Yes, other types of ham work. But check cooking times. Here, the recipe shines with smoked ham. Flavor develops in braising."
- "q: How to reheat? a: Loosely cover and microwave in intervals. Saucing helps. Avoid drying out. Use stovetop to reheat with sauce. Toss together gently."
