ingredients:
- "≈175 ml (3/4 cup) neutral oil (grapeseed or sunflower, no olive for milder taste)"
- "≈70 ml (1/4 cup + 1 tbsp) aquafaba (chickpea brine) or plant-based yogurt"
- "20 ml (1 tbsp) lemon juice fresh"
- "1 tsp Dijon mustard smooth"
- "2 cloves garlic finely grated (or 1 roasted clove for sweet-smoky)"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) fresh parsley finely chopped"
- "10 ml (2 tsp) fresh tarragon minced (swap with chives for onion note)"
- "½ tsp sea salt fine"
- "freshly ground black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "=== Prepare garlic ==="
- "Garlic grated fine—use microplane or small knife mince if no grater. If raw garlic too sharp, roast a clove wrapped in foil at 180°C (350°F) for 15 min until soft, caramel edges. Sweetens aioli, mellows bite."
- "=== Assemble base ==="
- "In medium bowl, whisk aquafaba or plant yogurt with lemon, mustard, salt, pepper. Aim for slightly frothy liquid. Adds acidity and body. Mustard stabilizes emulsification."
- "=== Incorporate oil slowly ==="
- "While whisking vigorously (or pulse blender on low), drizzle oil dropwise first—emulsion starts thickening. Then thin steady stream. Pause if sauce separates; whisk faster or add teaspoon lemon juice. Texture should be thick, creamy, holds peak."
- "=== Add garlic and herbs ==="
- "Fold in garlic, parsley, tarragon gently but thoroughly. Watch for flecks of green evenly distributed. Aroma sharpens now; fresh herb oils release fragrance. Adjust salt and pepper."
- "=== Final adjustment and rest ==="
- "Aioli benefits from 5-10 min rest in fridge—to meld flavors and thicken slightly. If too thick, stir in small drops of water or lemon until spreadable."
- "=== Troubleshoot and variations ==="
- "If emulsion breaks (looks oily or runny)—restart with fresh lemon juice, add broken sauce in tiny amounts, whisk fast. Can fix with one egg-free lecithin capsule or pinch mustard powder. For bolder garlic, add crushed raw after base emulsifies to avoid bitterness."
- "Serve cool but not cold; cold dulls flavors. Scooping sound when dipped, slight sheen on surface, vibrant herb specks visible."
introduction: "Raw garlic almost too sharp, but roasting tames it, caramel notes pop out. Quick to whip, no eggs—reliability matters. Ditch olive oil tired bitterness, use neutral oils for clean background. Aquafaba or coconut-skimmed yogurt adds lift, no dairy, no egg. Technique crucial—slow oil incorporation, or you’ll end up oily mess. Herbs more than garnish; they build layers, green, fresh kick cutting richness. Timing not strict—smell and feel your way. Resting lets flavors marry, thickens sauce just right. Perfect condiment for more than fries; smear on burgers, dip steamed artichokes; fizz in bottarga, anything needs punch. Simple but layered. Essential kitchen trick."
ingredientsNote: "Switch aquafaba for plain unsweetened plant yogurt—thicker base, mellower tang. If no chickpea brine, water + 1 tsp mustard can mimic viscosity but less body. Oil matters—do not use extra virgin olive oil unless robust flavor wanted—can turn bitter when raw and cold. Parsley and tarragon bring bright notes; absent tarragon, chives or basil work. Garlic dosing adjustable: fresh fine grated for sharp bite, roasted for sweetness. Salt is critical; under-seasoned aioli falls flat. Lemon fresh-squeezed; bottled lemon juice lacks brightness. Keep in mind, texture should be creamy, neither runny nor stiff—adjust oil or acidic liquids accordingly. Keep bowl dry, cold improves consistency but don’t chill so much flavor suppresses."
instructionsNote: "Start whisking acid base first—mustard, lemon, aquafaba—helps build stable emulsion when oil hits. Oil addition slow, drop by drop; do not rush. Watch sauce thicken gradually. If it looks watery, pause addition, whisk harder. Use microplane or fine grater for garlic—avoid chunks that don’t distribute well. Fold herbs last—overwhisk bruises green leaves, turns bitter. If emulsion breaks—stop trying fast; start new acid base, add broken sauce dropwise, whisk continuously—rebuild. Resting aioli in fridge lets oil bind further, flavors meld. Taste before serving; adjust salt, pepper, lemon. Texture clues: glossy surface, scooping sound, slight resistance under spoon signal done. Keep covered, last 3-4 days refrigerated, or freeze in small batches for convenience."
tips:
- "Garlic prep matters. Fresh is sharp, roast for mellow sweetness. Wrap cloves, foil, 180°C. 15 min, soft, caramelized edges."
- "Whisk aquafaba first. Helps emulsification. Lemon, mustard, salt, then oil dropwise. Drop, whisk, watch it thicken. Never rush."
- "Consistency key. If aioli too thick, whisk in drops of water or lemon. Adjust for spreadability, watch for texture cues."
- "Oil type matters. Use grapeseed or sunflower, avoid olive unless you want that strong note. Neutral oils allow flavors to shine."
- "Herbs add layers. Use parsley, tarragon, or substitute chives. Fresh herbs, chopped fine; fold in last. Keep vibrant green, avoid bruising."
faq:
- "q: How to fix a broken emulsion? a: Start fresh acid mix. Add broken sauce gradually, whisk continuously. Fast movements help."
- "q: Can I substitute aquafaba? a: Yes, use unsweetened plant yogurt. Thickens, mellower. Water plus mustard works too, but lesser flavor."
- "q: What if aioli ends up too runny? a: Add drops more oil, or restart. Too much oil at once? Pause, whisk harder."
- "q: Storage tips for aioli? a: Keep in fridge, covered. Last 3-4 days. Freeze small portions. Not too cold, flavor dulls."
