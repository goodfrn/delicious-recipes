- "6 ml (1 1/4 tsp) crushed red pepper flakes, adjust to taste"
- "40 ml (2 2/3 tbsp) extra virgin olive oil"
- "3 cloves garlic, finely minced"
- "70 ml (1/3 cup) dry white wine"
- "1 can 790 ml (27 oz) crushed San Marzano tomatoes"
- "=== Pasta and shrimp ==="
- "350 g (3/4 lb) penne rigate pasta"
- "400 g (14 oz) jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined"
- "25 ml (1 2/3 tbsp) olive oil"
- "35 ml (2 1/3 tbsp) chopped fresh basil"
- "200 ml (7 oz) shredded mozzarella cheese"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "=== Prepare spicy tomato sauce ==="
- "Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Sweat the shallot with crushed red pepper flakes until translucent and fragrant, about 6-7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in garlic; cook one minute till aromatic."
- "Pour in white wine, increase heat to medium-high, reduce by half around 8 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes. Simmer gently for about 12 minutes, stirring occasionally. Adjust salt and pepper at end."
- "=== Cook pasta ==="
- "Bring large pot salted water to a boil. Cook penne pasta until al dente, 10-12 minutes. Drain and toss lightly in a teaspoon of olive oil to prevent sticking. Set aside."
- "=== Cook shrimp and assemble ==="
- "Heat olive oil in a large skillet on high heat. Add shrimp; sear about 2-3 minutes per side until pink and slightly crisp. Season with salt and pepper."
- "Pour the spicy tomato sauce over shrimp, bring to a lively boil. Stir in drained pasta and fresh basil. Toss quickly to coat the penne evenly. Adjust seasoning if needed."
- "=== Serve ==="
- "Plate pasta with shrimp and sauce. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella on top immediately so it melts a bit. Serve hot."
introduction: "Shrimp sizzling in a pan. Tomato sauce thick and spicy. Sharp flakes of chili, garlic biting through. Pasta boiled just right – al dente, no mush. Sometimes basil, sometimes oregano. Wine cuts the acidity. Parmesan swapped for melty mozzarella for a twist. This mix wakes the senses, salt and heat tangoing. Quick but takes patience simmering the sauce. Fresh shrimp, large and firm, soak up the sauce heat, becoming tender but with a bite. Penne holds the sauce like little barrels, every forkful layered. Dinner pieces spiced and cheesy. Hot, tangy, creamy."
ingredientsNote: "Shallots over onions here for a sweeter, subtler base. Crushed red pepper flakes bumped up slightly, extra olive oil to coax flavor out of the spices. Wine increased just a touch for acidic balance, letting the acidic tomato simmer long enough to deepen while not drying out. Swapping fresh basil for Italian parsley changes aroma, adds freshness without overpowering. Mozzarella replaces Parmesan: milder texture, melting creamy bits over the hot pasta for a gooey finish. Jumbo shrimp trimmed and patted dry ensure proper searing and flavor sealing, no water to dilute sauce. Salt and pepper to taste at multiple points, keeping seasoning flexible. Penne size kept similar so the sauce clings well."
instructionsNote: "Sweat shallots low and slow to release sweetness and soften chili heat, careful not to brown. Garlic goes in late to avoid bitterness. Wine reduces over moderate heat, concentrating without burning the garlic. Tomatoes gentle simmer to thicken; stirring prevents sticking. Al dente pasta drained quickly to keep energy, tossed in oil to stop clumping early, avoiding soggy texture later when reheated with sauce. Shrimp cooked fast on high heat, searing creates crust but inside stays juicy. Sauce brought to boil again with shrimp, ensuring flavors meld and shrimp finish cooking thoroughly. Pasta then folded in with fresh basil to brighten the sauce. Mozzarella sprinkled at serve time for melting texture. Seasoning adjusted last minute to keep freshness. Timing overlaps for efficiency; sauce cooks while pasta boils and shrimp sears. Serve piping hot before cheese solidifies."
tips:
- "Pasta should always cook al dente. Time it right. Overcooked pasta can ruin texture. Keep one eye on the pot. A few minutes less help."
- "Searing shrimp on high. Quick, effective. Create crust but keep juicy inside. Timing crucial here. Don’t overcrowd the pan. Cook in batches."
- "Adjust red pepper flakes. Start with less if unsure. You can always add more later. Everyone's heat tolerance varies. Test your sauce before serving."
- "Simmer sauce gently. This thickens it. Stir frequently to prevent sticking. Reduce heat if it's bubbling too much. Takes patience for best results."
- "Fresh herbs matter. Basil brightens flavor. Add just before serving. Dry herbs aren't as potent. Always choose fresh if possible. Makes a big difference."
faq:
- "q: How to make shrimp tender? a: Don't overcook. 2-3 minutes per side on high heat. Juicy inside, crisp outsides. Ideal texture matters."
- "q: Can I use regular tomatoes instead of San Marzano? a: Yes, but San Marzano are sweeter. They balance acidity better. Choose quality for sauce."
- "q: What is the best way to reheat leftovers? a: On stove over low heat. Add splash of water if too thick. Microwaving can dry out the pasta."
- "q: Can I prepare sauce ahead? a: Absolutely. Makes meal quicker. Store in fridge up to three days. Reheat before serving for best flavor."
