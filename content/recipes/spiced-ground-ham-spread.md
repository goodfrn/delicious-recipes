ingredients:
- "10 ounces chopped ham steak, coarsely diced"
- "4 tablespoons mayonnaise"
- "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard"
- "1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce"
- "1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce"
- "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice"
- "1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika"
- "2 tablespoons finely diced dill pickles"
- "Fresh ground black pepper, to taste"
instructions:
- "Roughly cut ham into medium dices first. Toss into food processor but pulse briefly. Stop before it turns paste. Must hold some texture, small uneven crumbs good. Too fine and spread turns gluey."
- "Transfer minced ham to big mixing bowl. Add mayo, Dijon mustard, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and lemon juice all at once. Fold ingredients together with sturdy spoon or rubber spatula. Get everything coated evenly but avoid whipping air into mix."
- "Sprinkle smoked paprika and diced pickles on top. Fold again gently just till incorporated. Notice small pickle bits lighten texture, adding brightness and slight crunch."
- "Taste. Adjust seasoning here. More lemon juice if too rich. Extra hot sauce for heat. Black pepper according to preference. Stir final time."
- "Cover with plastic wrap, pressing gently to avoid air pockets. Refrigerate minimum 2.5 hours – longer chill Firms spread, flavors settle deep. Best served cold but not rock solid."
- "Spread cold on thick rye or toasted sourdough slices. Crackers work too, especially for an afternoon snack. Great dip for crisp raw veggies or even as sandwich filler with fresh lettuce leaves."
introduction: "Diced ham transformed. Always start coarse, not paste—texture signals freshness and keeps spread lively. Mayo must not overwhelm—reduce quantity, let mustard lead. Switched mustard to Dijon for sharper edge. Liquid acid pulls flavor—lemon juice adds brightness over common vinegar. Add smoked paprika for woody warmth; pickles offer contrast, crunch, and actually keep spread lively when chilled. Chill long enough, spread firms; skimp on chill, it stays sloppy and flavor weak. Serve on chewy breads or crunchy crackers. Skip the fluff—this teaches essentials, throwing out nonsense about smooth flow or ‘perfect.’ Focus on recognizing when it’s ready—texture, aroma, taste tell the true story."
ingredientsNote: "Ham steak works better than deli sliced for depth and salt balance. Chopping yourself controls size, avoiding mushy texture. Mayonnaise quantity cut by 20%—too much makes spread runny and bland. Dijon mustard chosen over yellow for cleaner tang and aroma. Acid switched from apple cider vinegar to fresh lemon juice—more fresh zing and less vinegar bite. Smoked paprika replaces cayenne, lending smoky undertone without just heat. Pickles diced small, not relish style, because chunks enhance mouthfeel without drying spread. Black pepper added last for freshly ground punch—skip if your ham is too peppery already. Hot sauce balance depends on heat tolerance—start small. Worcestershire syrupy umami backbone, tho optional if unavailable, soy sauce mix works."
instructionsNote: "Pulse ham just so—not puree. Watch texture through food processor lid. Stop as soon as pieces break down evenly but can still feel crumbs not paste. Folding mayo and condiments gently maintains texture, avoids air pockets. Add smoky paprika and pickles last to preserve texture contrast. Taste and adjust seasoning before chill—final seasoning is harder once cold and firm. Cover spread with cling film flush to avoid drying out skin. Minimum chill time bumped by 30 minutes to allow flavors to marry and spreading firmness. Touch cold spread for pliability—too firm means longer rest before serving. Serve refrigerated but take out 5 minutes prior to soften slightly. Common mistakes: over-processing ham; too much mayo; skipping chill; dumping all acid at once can lead to harsh sourness—add gradually. Use fresh lemon juice over bottled for purity. Pickles give crunch, ditch if soggy or watery."
tips:
- "Select ham steak over deli versions. Control texture—dice and pulse carefully for chunks. Avoid a paste. Prepping right matters."
- "Mayo can overwhelm; reduce amount. Keep Dijon mustard as the lead flavor. It sharpens the spread. Taste constantly while mixing."
- "Chill time matters. Let flavors meld and spread firm properly—at least 2.5 hours. If rushed, texture can suffer."
- "Use fresh lemon juice for acidity. Bottled stuff lacks freshness. Also consider capers if pickles don't work—just rinse dry."
- "Smoked paprika gives warmth but can burn. Adjust heat with less hot sauce. Balance flavors, taste before chilling."
faq:
- "q: What if ham is dry? a: Choose fresh, thick slices. Trim fat, avoid gray tones. Better taste without losing moisture. Try with moist."
- "q: Can I sub mayo? a: Yes, use Greek yogurt for a tang alternative. Adjust slowly, texture shifts with moisture."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Store tightly covered in fridge. Will last few days. Texture changes—bring out gently before serving."
- "q: What if too spicy? a: Add more mayo to tone down flavors. Can also mix in extra diced pickles to balance heat. Adjust at taste."
