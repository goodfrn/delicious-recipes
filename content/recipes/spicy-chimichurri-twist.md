ingredients:
- "350 ml (1 1/2 cups) olive oil"
- "50 ml (3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon) apple cider vinegar"

- "12 g (1/4 cup) chopped basil"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tablespoons) chopped flat-leaf parsley"
- "12 ml (2 teaspoons) chopped thyme"
- "12 ml (2 teaspoons) finely minced garlic"
- "10 ml (2 teaspoons) crushed red chili flakes"
- "5 ml (1 teaspoon) smoked paprika"
instructions:
- "Chop herbs roughly but not finely. Bring texture."
- "Mix shallots, garlic, and herbs in a medium bowl."
- "Pour in olive oil and vinegar gradually. Stir while pouring."
- "Add chile flakes and smoked paprika. Stir thoroughly."
- "Taste. Adjust heat with more chili flakes as needed."

- "Refrigerate leftovers in airtight container. Bring to room temp before use."
introduction: "Herbs chopped quick. Oil poured slow. Vinegar sharp. Heat fires from chili flakes, smoked paprika brings smoky hum. Freshness of basil swapped in for coriander’s brightness. Garlic pungent. Shallots sharp like tiny bursts. No wait. Or just fifteen minutes. Bold, no fuss. Works on veggies, meat, tofu, even bread. Sauce that doesn’t pretend. Ruthless in flavor. Keeps few days but better fast. Crisis in a bowl—if spice’s your game. Mashing blender not needed. Hand-chop, stir, wait. Simple enough, but packs a wallop. Tang, heat, oils slick. Stored cold, brightens more after warming. Not fancy. Just right."
ingredientsNote: "Use fresh herbs picked close to time of making. Basil replaces coriander for a sweeter, slightly peppery profile, balancing the oregano and thyme. Minced shallots bring crisp bite over onions for less sharpness. Use unrefined olive oil for fruitiness. Apple cider vinegar softens the vinegar edge of red wine, while smoked paprika adds earthy warmth unlike the usual heat alone—this lends complexity. Red chili flakes adjustable. Freshness important: dry herbs won't give same lively taste or texture. Chop herbs coarsely for a rustic mouthfeel, not a smooth paste. Garlic finely minced to blend but pop lightly. Measure spices with care—balance key."
instructionsNote: "No cooking step. Just chopping, measuring, mixing. Chop herbs and shallots uniformly but keep texture varied. When adding oil and vinegar, pour oil slowly with steady stirring to emulsify slightly, keeping sauce cohesive but pourable. Stirring chili flakes and smoked paprika thoroughly spreads heat. Let mixture rest minimum 15 minutes to meld flavors; if longer, refrigerate but bring to room temp before serving for aromas to bloom. Use clean utensils to avoid spoilage. This chimichurri shines fresh but will deepen if held one day refrigerated. Before serving, taste and tweak—more acid or spice depending on preference. Perfect fast fix for smoky grilled dishes or fresh veggies. Keep leftovers airtight. Serve chopped onions/crusty bread on side optional."
tips:
- "Chopping herbs is key. Don't be too fine. Want texture. Rough cuts add rustic feel. Bright green colors pop. Should look fresh and inviting."
- "When mixing, pour oil slow. Just steady stream. Makes it come together nicely. Not just dump it all. Stir gently. Emulsifies slightly."
- "Take care with vinegar amount. Apple cider softens the sharp taste. Adjust according to preference. Might need more or less for balance."
- "Let sit for at least 15 minutes. Don't rush this. Flavors develop over time. Cold storage makes it deeper. Room temp before serving."
- "More chili might be needed. Heat varies with each chili. Adjust based on taste. Spice level matters. Experiment for perfect zing."
