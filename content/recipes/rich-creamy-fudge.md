Quick microwave melting, no double boilers needed. Mini chips add texture but can swap in chopped nuts or dried fruit for a twist. Butter gives silkiness; switch to coconut oil for dairy-free. Vanilla extract balances deep chocolate bitterness. Notes on spotting smooth melting and fixing grainy texture. Refrigerate until firm but pliable for clean cuts. Quick fix dessert or treat base for mix-ins."

ingredients:
- "1 cup bittersweet chocolate chips"
- "1/2 cup evaporated milk"
- "3 tablespoons unsalted butter"
- "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
- "1/4 teaspoon flaky sea salt"
- "1/3 cup mini dark chocolate chips optional"
- "parchment paper"
- "cooking spray"
instructions:
- "Cut parchment to fit an 8×8 square pan. Spray lightly with cooking spray. Set aside."
- "Combine chocolate chips, evaporated milk, and butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 1-2 minute bursts, stirring vigorously between intervals to force ingredients to melt evenly. Look for glossy chocolate with no grainy clumps."
- "When mixture thickens and smooths but still warm, stir in vanilla extract and sea salt. Salt isn’t optional here — it cuts the richness and brightens chocolate."
- "Pour the molten fudge into prepared pan, spreading evenly. If using the mini chips, sprinkle immediately over the surface and press lightly to embed. They stick better while fudge is tacky but not too hot."
- "Ignore timers, watch texture. When fudge surface dulls and pulls cleanly from the edges of pan, it's ready for chilling. Transfer to refrigerator. One hour minimum, ideally two for best sliceability."
- "Cut into 16 squares with a hot, dry knife for clean lines—wipe blade between cuts. Serve chilled or at room temp if you want it chewier."
introduction: "Fudge without the boiler hassle. Microwave melting saves time but watch carefully—overheating chocolate turns gritty fast. Bittersweet chips bring deep cocoa flavor. Switch to evaporated milk for less sweetness and a creamier texture than sweetened condensed milk. Butter for fat, vanilla for lift. Sea salt makes a big difference, do not skip. Mini chips add bite, swap in chopped nuts to disrupt dense sugar slab. Chill until almost firm but not rock solid. Cut with a hot knife to avoid crumbly squares. If grainy, rewarm slightly and whisk vigorously until shine returns. Hard-earned tips save ruined batches."
ingredientsNote: "Evaporated milk replaces sweetened condensed milk here, lowering sugar but adding creaminess. Butter is best unsalted to control seasoning; sub with coconut oil but fudge sets firmer and flavor shifts slightly. Bittersweet chocolate provides depth, can use semisweet if preferred but fudge will sweeten noticeably. Vanilla extract brightens flavors—use pure extract, not imitation. Flaky sea salt finishes the fudge, cuts the dense sweetness. Mini chips on top add texture bite but chopped roasted nuts, dried cherries, or even crushed pretzels work well too. Parchment lining prevents sticking and makes removal cleanup simple. Cooking spray helps peel away edges cleanly."
instructionsNote: "Microwave melting broken into intervals ensures chocolate doesn't scorch. Whisk between bursts to smooth lumps—grainy fudge usually means chocolate scorched or overheated. Adding vanilla post melting preserves aroma. Salt adds contrast, mix well. Pressing toppings lightly ensures adhesion without melting them in. Visual cues key: glossy molten fudge signals ready to pour. When fudge surface dulls and pulls from pan edges, it's firm enough to chill. Forget exact times—look, feel, touch. Chilling firm but not frozen, slice with hot dry knife for neat edges. If fudge separates or hardens unevenly, gentle warming and stirring can rescue texture. Keep fudge refrigerated if using softer fats to prevent melting."
tips:
- "Microwave intervals. Don’t rush it. 1-2 minutes, stir between. Feel the heat. Glossy chocolate signals next step. Grains mean too hot. Fix? Gently rewarm."
- "Adding vanilla later keeps aroma bright. Salt really matters. It balances all that sweet richness. Mini chips? Press them lightly. They stick better warm."
- "Chilling is key. Not rock solid. One hour minimum. Two hours for even better results. Watch texture, not clocks. Surface should dull, pull away from edges."
- "Cutting? Hot dry knife. Wipe blade between slices. Clean lines. Rewarm and whisk if grainy. Don't let it ruin efforts. Restore shine smartly."
- "Ingredient swaps. Coconut oil for dairy-free. Flavor shifts a bit. Pecans or dried fruit work too. Mix-ins? Versatile fudge base. Get adventurous."
faq:
- "q: Why is my fudge grainy? a: Might mean chocolate overheated. Next time watch temp. Rewarm carefully, whisk till shines. Restore texture fast."
- "q: Can I use regular milk instead of evaporated? a: No, won’t work right. Evaporated adds creaminess, richness. Works better overall. Trust the recipe."
- "q: How do I store leftover fudge? a: Fridge is best. Keeps it from melting. Airtight container is a must. Saran wrap? Use that first if needed."
- "q: Can I add toppings? a: Yes, crushed nuts or fruit. Consider texture. Press them lightly to stick. Don't let them sink or mix in too deeply."
