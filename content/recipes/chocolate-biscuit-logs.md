slug: "chocolate-biscuit-logs"
description: "Rich dark chocolate melted with creamy butter, whipped into a silky base mixing crunchy biscuit chunks and fluffy marshmallows. Golden raisins swapped for dried cherries add tartness, toasted almond slivers replace pine nuts for crunch. Rolled tight in foil, chilled until firm, then dusted with icing sugar to mimic a cured saucisson. A classic no-bake French sweet turned playful with new textures and flavors. Great for bites at parties or casual nibbling, dairy free with margarine swap, egg can be omitted for vegans using flax egg. Timing flexible—look for firmness not just minutes. Brings surprise mouthfeel and deep cocoa notes, nostalgia with an adult twist."

ingredients:
- "160 g dark chocolate 65%, chopped"
- "135 ml unsalted margarine, softened"
- "180 ml powdered sugar"
- "1 large egg or 1 tbsp flaxseed meal plus 3 tbsp water"
- "220 ml petit-beurre biscuits, broken to 1 cm pieces"
- "125 ml mini white marshmallows, diced"
- "30 ml dried cherries, chopped"
- "30 ml slivered toasted almonds"
instructions:
- "Set heatproof bowl over simmering water; melt chocolate and margarine together slowly, stirring until smooth."
- "Remove from heat. Whisk in powdered sugar until dissolved and mixture thickens slightly. Quickly beat in egg or flax egg until glossy and homogeneous."
- "Fold in biscuits, marshmallows, dried cherries, and toasted almonds gently to maintain distinct pieces."
- "Place mixture on foil; shape into one 25–30 cm log or two shorter logs. Wrap foil, twisting ends snugly."
- "Chill 1.5–2 hours until firm but still yielding slightly under finger pressure."
- "Unwrap carefully. Roll log in powdered sugar to coat. Tie ends with kitchen twine if desired."
- "Slice with serrated knife; serve cold on wooden board."
introduction: "Dark chocolate melting slow over simmering water. Butter softens, blending smoothly. Crisp biscuit chunks ready to deliver crunch. Marshmallows cut in small cubes promising little pops of soft sweetness. Dried cherries swapped in place of traditional golden raisins—sharper, a little tart. Toasted almonds replacing pine nuts—different crunch, more nuttiness. Everything folded gently to keep texture distinct. Rolled tight in foil sheets, twisted ends pinched close. Chilled not rushed until firm enough to slice clean. Rolled in powdered sugar—dusty white exterior mimics real cured meats like driedsaucisson. Rustic presentation on wooden board. Not just sweets but texture, aroma, depth. Egg or flax egg to bind. Cinnamon or pinch of sea salt optional for complexity. A classic turned modern; straightforward no bake, relying on touch and feel over rigid timings. Patience pays off. Resist temptation to slice too early—chunks must be set. The aromas of dark chocolate and toasted almonds fill kitchen at chilling time, tempting but worth wait. Bite into rough crunch, marshmallow softness, fruit brightness. Simple transformed."
ingredientsNote: "Dark chocolate at 65% is less bitter, mellower than 70%, balances nicely with sweet elements. Margarine chosen to keep dairy free option; unsalted butter fine too but margarine is more affordable and stable. Powdered sugar integrates smoothly, no graininess. Flax egg replaces real egg for vegans—prepare by mixing flaxseed meal with water, resting 5 min to gel before addition. Biscuits—petit-beurre or similar, broken uniformly to keep even baking texture, around half an inch chunks. Marshmallows diced evenly avoid melting into base completely, adding chewy contrast. Dried cherries add sour brightness missing from golden raisins, cutting sweetness. Toasted almonds stronger crunch, subtle bitterness replaces pine nuts' buttery notes. Optional cinnamon or pinch of sea salt enhances overall flavor. Refrigeration solidifies shape; no baking needed but requires chill time for textures to meld. Avoid overmixing ingredients to prevent biscuit breaking down too much or marshmallows dissolving."
instructionsNote: "Melting chocolate slowly avoids grainy texture; bain-marie preferred to direct heat to protect emulsion. Temperature control key—too hot and egg scrambles; too cold and sugar lumps remain. Adding powdered sugar into warm mixture helps dissolve fine crystals quickly, smoothing texture. Use whisk first for sugar and egg, then spatula for folding in solids to preserve crunch. Forming log shape on foil makes easy wrapping, standard sizing important for even chilling. Press gently to compact without compressing into a dense block—texture relies on air pockets and distinct pieces. Chilling minimum 90 minutes but test firmness with fingertip—should yield slightly under finger but not feel soft. Rolling in powdered sugar doubles as aesthetic and keeps pieces from sticking to knife on slicing. Serrated knife reduces crumbling edges. If chocolate thickens too much mid-process, a teaspoon vegetable oil loosens, but don’t rush melting. Serving temperature cold but not frozen; flavors open up once slightly warmed to room temp. Store in fridge tightly wrapped, best consumed within 3 days for freshness and texture."
tips:
- "Use bain-marie when melting chocolate. Avoid direct heat, grainy texture. Temp control is vital. Simply simmer and stir. Mix in margarine well."
- "For vegan option, flax egg is easy. Mix flaxseed meal with water. Let it sit few mins to gel. Use it right after for binding. Easy swap."
- "Keep chocolate around 50°C. Hotter scrambles eggs; cooler lumpy sugar. Whisk powdered sugar in while warm. Helps keep everything smooth. No graininess."
- "Be gentle folding biscuits and marshmallows. Don’t overmix or crush. Keep that crunch. Aim for texture contrast—soft, chewy, crisp."
- "Chill logs long enough. Firm but yielding under pressure; 1.5 to 2 hours minimum. Time varies, check doneness with your finger."
faq:
- "q: Can I use another type of chocolate? a: Sure. Any dark chocolate works but adjust sweetness. Note flavor profiles vary with higher cocoa."
- "q: How to store these logs? a: Wrap tightly in foil or parchment. Fridge keeps them fresh. Eat within 3 days for best texture."
- "q: What if the chocolate seizes? a: No worries! Add warm water or a splash of neutral oil. Mix gently to bring it back."
- "q: Can I add different nuts or fruits? a: Yes! Change it up with walnuts, pecans or different dried fruits. Experiment with flavors, but textures matter."
