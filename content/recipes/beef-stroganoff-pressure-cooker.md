- "20 g whole wheat flour"
- "115 ml dry red wine"

- "4 ml smoked paprika"
- "230 g egg noodles"
- "150 ml sour cream 10%"
- "15 g fresh thyme leaves"

instructions:
- "Heat 12 ml olive oil in a skillet over medium-high. Brown a third of the sirloin strips quickly, seasoning with salt and pepper. Remove, repeat with remaining beef."
- "Preheat pressure cooker pot on Sauté mode for 3 minutes. Add ghee, then onions, garlic, mushrooms. Cook until golden, about 7 minutes. Sprinkle flour, stir for 1 minute."
- "Pour in wine, scrape any browned bits. Stir in beef stock, mustard seeds, smoked paprika. Return beef to pot, mix well."
- "Close lid. Select Meat mode. Set cook time to 30 minutes."
- "Meanwhile, boil salted water in pot. Cook egg noodles until al dente, drain. Toss with remaining oil to stop sticking."
- "Once cooking ends, let pressure release naturally around 20 minutes before opening lid."
- "Stir sour cream in gently. Taste, add salt and pepper if needed."
- "Sprinkle fresh thyme on top before serving. Plate over noodles."
introduction: "Sirloin sliced thin, browned in olive oil. Mushrooms, onions, garlic roasted in ghee until brown, earthy. Flour folded in to thicken. Red wine splash blacks out the bottom of the pot. Beef stock salty, tangy, rich. Mustard seeds pop beneath tongue, smoky paprika smokes the back of the throat. Pressure cooking cuts wait time down. Egg noodles boiled firm but still chewy, oiled so they don’t stick, swallow the sauce well. Sour cream added at last, cools the heat, thickens the sauce. Thyme fresh, green, aromatic on top. A different spin, but all the essential flavors still there. Home-cooked, rustic, deep, quick."
ingredientsNote: "Sirloin is used for tenderness and fast cooking. Olive oil for searing - more neutral. Ghee replaces butter, adds nutty depth. Cremini mushrooms instead of white button — earthier, more flavor. Whole wheat flour thickens naturally, adds slight nuttiness. Red wine dry and bold, scraped to release all flavors. Beef stock — store-bought or homemade. Dijon mustard with seeds used instead of grainy mustard for texture and sharpness. Smoked paprika replaces sweet paprika adding a subtle heat and smokiness. Egg noodles are fresh and need quick boiling. Sour cream always stirred last to prevent curdling. Fresh thyme swaps for chives, adds different herb note."
instructionsNote: "Use medium-high heat to brown beef quickly, prevents steaming. Working in thirds means even browning without overcrowding. Preheat pressure cooker for better sauté results, 3 minutes rather than 2. Cook veggies a bit longer to get more golden edges, about 7 min, not 5. Fold in flour to avoid lumps, 1 min stirring. Deglaze with wine, scrape bottom no skipping; flavor comes from fond. Use Meat mode on pressure cooker for 30 minutes, adds 5 to original 25, gives beef more tenderness. Pressure release naturally for 20 min, longer than original 15 to avoid sudden toughening. Cook egg noodles al dente for some bite, toss in 10 ml olive oil to keep separate. Stir sour cream in slowly off heat to keep texture. Season after, adjust salt and pepper tightly. Thyme poured on top at end, not cooked in, to preserve fresh taste."
tips:
- "Use sirloin. It’s tender, cooks fast. Thin strips essential for good browning. Heat oil first. Prevent steaming while sautéing beef. Maybe work in batches for best results."
- "Don’t skip deglazing with wine. Those browned bits at bottom? Flavor bombs. Scrape well. Mix beef back in, ensure all tastes come together. Check moisture level. Adjust liquids, if needed."
- "Keep veggies sautéing longer. Aim for golden, caramelized edges. It builds depth. Ghee offers nice nuttiness. Substitutes like butter add different flavors. Preheat pressure cooker for best browning."
- "Natural pressure release is key. Wait 20 minutes post cooking. Avoid toughening beef. Safety first. Pot won’t be under pressure immediately. Follow with careful stirring of sour cream."
- "Thyme adds freshness. Sprinkle last, not during cooking. Preserves flavor. Consider adding other herbs or spices for variety. This dish can be more than one flavor profile."
faq:
- "q: How should I store leftovers? a: Cool completely. Place in airtight container. Store in fridge up to three days. Reheat gently on stove. Microwave works too."
- "q: Can I substitute ingredients? a: Yes, but flavors vary. Use different mushrooms, even chicken if beef is unavailable. Whole wheat flour can swap for regular. Experiment."
- "q: Why is my sauce too runny? a: If too loose, next time add more flour during sauté. Or let it cook longer, reduce liquid. Simple solutions can adjust thickness."
- "q: What if I don’t have a pressure cooker? a: Stovetop method works too. Simmer longer until tender. Check frequently. Adjust cooking time based on heat level and doneness."
