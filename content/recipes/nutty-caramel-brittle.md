description: "Crunchy candy mixing sugar, corn syrup, butter, salt, and toasted almonds with a hint of sea salt and cinnamon. Melt sugars without stirring till light amber. Reach hard crack stage at 300°F. Add baking soda and pure vanilla fast to get bubbled texture. Spread hot caramel quickly, cool fully, snap. Substituting peanuts with almonds and salted butter for deeper flavor. Cinnamon adds subtle warmth. Watch sugar color not burn; moving pan off heat controls carryover cooking. Classic brittle reimagined with simple twists and expert timing cues."

ingredients:
- "2 tbsp water"
- "1 1/4 cup granulated sugar"
- "3/4 cup light corn syrup"
- "3 tbsp salted butter"
- "1 cup roasted almonds"
- "1/2 tsp baking soda"
- "1 tsp pure vanilla extract"
- "1/4 tsp ground cinnamon"
- "Pinch flaky sea salt"
instructions:
- "Line large rimmed baking sheet with silicone mat or parchment paper; set aside."
- "Place water, sugar, corn syrup, and salted butter in heavy stockpot fitted with candy thermometer."
- "Turn heat to medium; DO NOT stir while sugar dissolves and mixture heats."
- "Watch for the syrup to turn lightly amber and read thermometer approaching 300°F (hard crack stage)."
- "When 295-300°F hit, immediately remove pot from heat to prevent overshoot; electric stoves benefit from moving pot to cool burner."
- "Quickly stir in baking soda, vanilla, almonds, and cinnamon; mixtures foam rapidly due to baking soda."
- "Pour bubbling hot mixture onto prepared sheet; use plastic spatula to spread into roughly 9x12 inch rectangle fast before hardening sets in."
- "Sprinkle flaky sea salt immediately on surface to balance sweetness."
- "Let cool completely at room temperature, no refrigeration; brittle snaps when fully hardened."
- "Break into uneven chunks; store airtight to maintain crunch."
introduction: "Sugar melting, bubbling up like a storm to golden color. Butter melts in, thickening the mix, aroma rich and heady. Know the hard crack by thermometer or snap test on a cold plate—solid and brittle, no chew. Almonds over peanuts—less oily, crispier crunch. Salted butter helps season as you go, elevating caramel edge. Cinnamon twist cuts sweetness with warmth, complexity. Baking soda means quick foam; spread fast before it stiffens. Cool completely—patience pays. Toss in sea salt flakes on top, it breaks saccharine monotony. Easy kitchen chemistry turning simple sugar into irresistible brittle shards. Watch timing, watch heat—pay attention; that's the difference between sticky mess and candy gold. Simple tools, precise moves, quick hands. Kitchen noise—bubbling, hissing, silent sugar turning golden brown."
ingredientsNote: "Substitutions matter. Salted butter cuts time adding salt later, but unsalted + sea salt works fine. Roasted almonds swap peanuts for cleaner flavor, less grease; use walnuts or pecans if preferred. Light corn syrup keeps sugars from crystallizing; glucose syrup or golden syrup can substitute but watch flavors. Baking soda essential—creates air bubbles, lightening texture; omit and brittle turns dense and harder to bite. Extra cinnamon adds subtle complexity—optional but recommended. Keep water minimal—just wetting sugar helps even dissolve. Don't stir once boiling starts; crystals form on sides can ruin brittle. Use silicone mat or parchment to prevent sticking; foil will stick. Tools: candy thermometer critical; old reliable technique beats guessing by color alone."
instructionsNote: "Start boiling at medium heat to gently dissolve sugar—vigorous boils risk uneven crystals or burning. No stirring till syrup thickens and light amber shows. Watch thermometer; small overshoot means burnt caramel, bitter taste. Off heat quickly stops carryover cooking, common error when residual heat bumps temps. Baking soda addition bubbles caramel; mix quickly but carefully—hot bubbles can splatter. Pour onto baking sheet immediately, spreading rapidly before thick firms. Plastic spatula better than metal—won't scratch mat and less sticky. Hands can get burned, so move quick but safely. Cooling on counter avoids condensation issues that refrigeration can cause; brittle soggy if chilled too soon. Snapping brittle unevenly allows rustic pieces, perfect for snacks or garnish. Store airtight, cool, dry place to maintain crispness or it will soften from humidity. Practice timing and sensory cues refine results every batch."
tips:
- "Watch sugar closely. Medium heat. No stirring till amber. Too high, burning risks. Use candy thermometer; accurate."
- "Butter adds flavor. Salted reduces effort. Can substitute unsalted, plus sprinkle sea salt later. Texture essential."
- "Move pot off heat quickly. Stops carryover cooking. Too much heat results in burnt flavor; low and slow."
- "Pour fast—bubbles expand. Spread before thickening. Plastic spatula won’t stick, less burn risk. Shape matters!"
- "Cool on counter; chill hurts texture. Brittle may turn soggy. Watch humidity levels affecting crispness."
faq:
- "q: Why is my brittle sticking? a: Probably wrong surface. Use silicone or parchment, not foil; it clings."
- "q: What if caramel burned? a: Start over. Monitor closely; instant loss of flavor and texture."
- "q: Can I swap nuts? a: Yes; walnuts, pecans fit. Adjust flavors. Almonds less oily, better crunch."
- "q: How to store? a: Airtight container, dry spot. Humidity ruins crisp. Chill not advised, avoid moisture."
