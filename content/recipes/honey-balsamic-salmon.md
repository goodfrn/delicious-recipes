ingredients:
- "=== Maple plank ==="
- "1 untreated maple plank about 40 x 16 cm (16 x 6 1/4 in) for barbecue grilling, soaked"
- "=== Salmon ==="
- "500 g (1 1/8 lb) salmon with skin, cut into 4 fillets"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) honey"
- "7 ml (1 1/2 tsp) crushed fennel seeds"
- "3 ml (3/4 tsp) cracked black peppercorns"
- "salt to taste"
- "=== Vinaigrette ==="
- "40 ml (2 2/3 tbsp) olive oil"
- "25 ml (1 2/3 tbsp) aged balsamic vinegar"
- "1 small shallot, finely diced"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) serrano chili, seeded and minced"
- "Handful of chopped fresh cilantro leaves for garnish"
instructions:
- "Soak maple plank in water, fully submerged, for 2 to 5 hours in a glass dish approx 33 x 23 cm (13 x 9 in)."
- "In a shallow dish, brush salmon fillets evenly with honey. Sprinkle with crushed fennel and black pepper. Salt lightly. Cover and chill at least 10 minutes."
- "In a small bowl, whisk olive oil, balsamic vinegar, diced shallot, and minced serrano chili. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside."
- "Preheat grill to medium heat. Place maple plank on grill grates and heat 8 to 15 minutes until beginning to smoke."
- "Arrange salmon fillets skin-side down on hot plank. Close lid and grill 8 to 15 minutes until desired doneness."
- "Remove salmon from grill. Spoon vinaigrette over salmon. Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves. Serve immediately."
introduction: "Marinated fish, grilled over soaked wood plank gives smoke and sweetness mixing. Honey tames the fennel and pepper bite. Vinaigrette with balsamic acid punch, olive oil smoothness, shallot sharpness, and serrano chili heat. Different from jalapeño. Cilantro fresh twist, replacing parsley. Grill time moves fast, must watch. Fish juicy, skin crisp. Maple plank soaks long for flavor bursts. Balancing sweet, spicy, tangy — no frills, just punch. Quick, rustic, gets smoky notes under lid. Four fillets on board. Perfect for a no-fuss grill night. A bit tangy, smoky, sharp, tender. Cook time depends on thickness, 8 to 15 minutes range works."
ingredientsNote: "Maple plank is untreated to avoid chemicals; soak it at least 2 hours, longer if possible, up to 5 hours. This soaking prevents burning and allows subtle smoky infusion into salmon. Honey quantity reduced from usual; too much coats too thick, might burn. Fennel seed crushed fine, not powdered, lends aromatic crunch with black pepper. Serrano chili chosen to swap jalapeño, adds sharper heat and fruity notes. Cilantro instead of parsley brings fresh, citrusy edge — adjust if not preferred. Vinegar slightly dialed down for balanced acidity, olive oil smooths it out. Shallot dice must be fine to blend well in vinaigrette; rough pieces distract. Salmon portion set for four servings, skin on retains moisture and crisps nicely."
instructionsNote: "Soaking plank is key, dry plank burns fast, soaking protects and infuses smoke. Use a glass or ceramic dish to avoid flavor transfer. Honey brush then spices applied — don’t skip chilling step; it helps flavors set but keep under 15 minutes so fish stays fresh. Whisk vinaigrette ingredients at once, temperature room or slightly cooled for better emulsification. Grill preheated with plank on to ignite subtle smoke, keep heat medium to avoid flare-ups. Once salmon is on plank, close lid—pressure holds heat to cook evenly and smoke absorbs. Check after 8 minutes, total grill time depends on thickness and grill heat; be ready to pull to avoid drying. Serve hot, spoon vinaigrette right before eating to keep brightness and texture. Cilantro garnish last second, no heavy mixing; delicate leaves wilt fast over heat."
tips:
- "Soak the maple plank nicely. 2-5 hours is a must. The longer, the better. Water keeps it from burning. Adds flavor too. Use a glass dish."
- "Brush honey then sprinkle spices. Do not skip marinating time. Max 15 minutes chill time. Flavors mix but fish stays fresh. Too long may compromise texture."
- "For vinaigrette, whisk all ingredients together. Use room temperature items to blend well. Aged balsamic adds depth. Serrano chili gives a nice punch."
- "Watch grill heat level. Medium is best. Plank should smoke lightly. Too hot means flare-ups, burnt salmon. Keep an eye on it."
- "Serving salmon hot keeps flavor intact. Spoon vinaigrette on right before serving. Garnish with cilantro last to avoid wilting."
faq:
- "q: How long should I soak the maple plank? a: At least 2 hours, up to 5 hours. Longer gives better flavor infusion. Avoid burning. Use water."
- "q: Can I use a different fish? a: Yes, any firm fish works. But salmon has specific flavor notes. Cooking times vary by thickness too."
- "q: What if my vinaigrette separates? a: Re-whisk it before serving. Room temperature helps mix. Adding mustard can help emulsify too."
- "q: How should I store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in an airtight container. Best eaten within 2 days. Reheat gently to avoid drying out."
