description: "Soft, golden burger buns made with a slight twist on hydrating liquids and a touch of honey instead of sugar. Yeast activation is crucial; dough texture signals readiness. Seeds optional but add crunch. Requires gentle heat and patient proofing. Baking cues are smell and color rather than clock watching. Makes 7 buns, slightly smaller size. Butter replaced with olive oil for a lighter crumb."

ingredients:
- "2 eggs, room temperature"
- "165 ml (2/3 cup) water at ambient temp"
- "80 ml (1/3 cup plus 1 tsp) warm coconut milk"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) honey"
- "6 ml (1 1/4 tsp) instant yeast"
- "470 g (3 1/4 cups) unbleached all-purpose flour"
- "25 ml (1 2/3 tbsp) extra virgin olive oil"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) fine sea salt"
- "black sesame seeds, optional"
instructions:
- "1. Whisk 1 egg in a large bowl. Add water, coconut milk, honey and yeast. Wait 8–10 minutes until foams lightly. The yeast should emit a yeasty scent and bubbles. If no bubbles, yeast dead; restart with new batch."
- "2. In a stand mixer fitted with dough hook, combine flour, olive oil and salt. Mix briefly until sand-like texture appears, a bit crumbly but even."
- "3. Pour liquid into dry ingredients while mixer runs on low speed. Knead 6–7 minutes medium speed until dough forms a smooth ball, slightly tacky but not sticky. It should stretch without tearing when pinched. If sticky, dust lightly with flour a tablespoon at a time."
- "4. Transfer dough ball to a lightly oiled bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap. Place in warm spot free of drafts (like inside turned-off oven with light on). Let rise about 1 hour 20 minutes or until doubled in size. Dough will gently spring back when poked slowly with fingertip. Avoid quick taps that slam the dough."
- "5. Meanwhile, line a baking sheet with parchment or silicone liner. Lightly flour workspace."
- "6. Once risen, gently deflate dough on floured surface. Divide into 7 equal pieces (about 90 g each). Roll each into tight, smooth balls by cupping your palm and gently rolling against the counter with firm pressure. This seals surface preventing cracks during second rise."
- "7. Space balls evenly on tray, at least 3 cm apart."
- "8. Cover loosely with oiled plastic wrap—too tight and buns stick; too loose and dry out. Proof at room temp (around 22 °C/72 °F) for 50 minutes or until visibly puffed, nearly doubled again."
- "9. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 185 °C (365 °F) with rack in center. Prepare egg wash: beat remaining egg with 1 tbsp water. This gives sheen and helps seeds stick but avoid slopping on sides or buns stick together."
- "10. When proofed, brush buns lightly with egg wash. Sprinkle black sesame seeds if using, for nuttiness and texture contrast."
- "11. Bake 18 minutes. When edges turn golden and buns sound hollow when tapped under bottom, done. Interior should spring back when lightly pressed."
- "12. Transfer to wire rack. Let cool completely before slicing to avoid gummy texture inside."
- "13. Store cooled buns in airtight container at room temp 2–3 days or freeze for longer storage."
introduction: "Buns rarely get the credit they deserve. Store-bought? Too dense or crumbly; often overly sweet or full of preservatives. Push past the sugar and butter defaults. Coconut milk in place of dairy milk gives subtle richness and moisture, especially if you’re avoiding lactose. Olive oil replaces butter for easier dough handling and less chance of squeezing out the fat during kneading. Use honey instead of white sugar; yeast loves it, fermentation speeds, aroma develops. Mixing technique impacts crumb — too rough, you’ll end with crumbly buns; too soft, they spread flat during proofing. Proofing temperature crucial. Aim for a steady warm spot where the dough wakes slowly — think body temp. The shiny egg wash is your crust’s patina and natural glue for seeds. Bake until golden, smell yeasty and sweet, tap bottom for hollow sound — these sensory cues trump any timer."
ingredientsNote: "Eggs must be room temperature to activate yeast properly. Coconut milk can be canned or carton — if canned, stir well beforehand to mix cream and water for even hydration. Extra virgin olive oil substitutes butter here, offering a lighter crumb with less risk of dough tightening. Honey isn’t just sweetener; it’s also antimicrobial and feeds yeast more gently than refined sugar. Instant yeast used here skips proofing step but still verify freshness with bubble test; expired yeast means flat buns. Flour measured by spooning lightly into measuring cup, not scooping aggressively — too much flour makes tough dough. Salt controls yeast fermentation, so don’t skip or overdo it. Sesame seeds optional but add a nutty crunch; substitute with poppy or flax seeds if desired."
instructionsNote: "Yeast activation critical. Let the mix rest long enough to verify bubbling; no bubbles, no rise later. Kneading develops gluten structure responsible for rise and texture. Machine kneading preferred for consistent results but hand kneading works if dough becomes stretchy before tears. Shape dough in tight balls to trap air during rising — a slack surface will crack or flatten. Proofing twice is key; first rise develops flavor and gas, second rise shapes buns. Cover with oiled plastic wrap to prevent skin formation; dry spots lead to cracking. Egg wash applied just before baking encourages browning and helps seeds adhere—avoid over applying or buns bake soggy. Oven temp set slightly lower than standard 190 °C to avoid overbrowning before fully cooked inside. Tap buns after baking; hollow sound means air pockets well developed. Cool fully for clean slices; warm bread tears and becomes gummy inside. Store buns airtight to preserve softness but avoid refrigeration which dries out fast."
tips:
- "Egg temp matters, room temp eggs activate yeast. Don't skip this step. Cold eggs lead to slow rise. Use warm water; yeast loves warmth."
- "Kneading is crucial, aim for texture. Dough should be slightly tacky but smooth. Overworking leads to dense buns; keep it gentle while kneading."
- "Plan your rising time well; find a warm, draft-free spot. Yeast needs warmth—think cozy not hot. Cold spots slow the rise; away from the fridge is key."
- "For shaping, tight balls help buns rise nicely. Gently roll the pieces between your palms. Keep surface smooth to prevent cracks during the second rise."
- "Egg wash adds a beautiful color; brush lightly. Too much drips and flattens buns during baking. If skipped, buns won't have the same sheen."
faq:
- "q: Why did my buns not rise properly? a: Check yeast freshness first. Old yeast doesn’t activate well. Room temp is crucial for eggs and dough."
- "q: Can I substitute ingredients? a: Yes, use any milk alternative if lactose-free. Maple syrup can replace honey. Olive oil works in place of butter."
- "q: How do I avoid gummy centers? a: Bake until golden, tap bottoms for hollow sound. Right browning cues mean they’re fully baked inside."
- "q: Best way to store leftovers? a: Keep in airtight container at room temp. If freezing, freeze before cutting. Prevents moisture loss and keeps texture."
