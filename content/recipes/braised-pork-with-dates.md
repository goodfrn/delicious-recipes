ingredients:
- "40 ml non-bleached all-purpose flour"
- "1.8 kg pork shoulder"
- "30 ml ghee"
- "300 ml vegetable broth"
- "75 ml whole grain mustard"
- "750 g small fingerling potatoes"
- "400 g peeled shallots"
- "10 Medjool dates, pitted and chopped"
- "1 tsp ground cinnamon"
- "1 tsp smoked paprika"
- "Salt and black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Coat pork evenly with flour mixed with cinnamon and smoked paprika."
- "Heat ghee over medium-high; brown pork all around until golden. Season with salt and pepper."
- "Place pork in slow cooker."
- "Deglaze pan with vegetable broth and mustard, scraping browned bits. Pour over pork."
- "Arrange potatoes, shallots, and dates around pork, pushing into broth."
- "Cook covered on low for 8 to 8.5 hours until tender."
- "Optionally hold on warm for up to 5 hours."
- "Serve meat shredded or sliced with vegetables ladled alongside."
introduction: "Pork rubbed thick with seasoned flour. Ghee replaces butter, richer, nuttier fat. Seeded dates diced and scattered around for bursts of caramel sweetness. Small fingerling potatoes soak up all juices. Shallots peeled but whole, soften and sweeten alongside. Long slow cook transforms shoulder into tender pull-apart meat. Broth and grainy mustard create sharp, savory liquid. Smoked paprika and cinnamon tweak the flavor—warmth, earthiness, a hint of spice. Vegetable broth replaces chicken to lighten. Time stretched slightly. All components mingle in one pot. Balanced rustic meal. Simple technique, layered notes. Works well any chilly evening."
ingredientsNote: "Flour acts as light coating and thickener. Ghee gives nutty depth, last-minute swap for butter avoids lactose but keeps richness. Vegetable broth cleaner flavor than chicken, pairs well with smoky paprika and cinnamon—both subtle but noticeable. Dates swell during cooking, sweet contrast essential here. Potatoes small and waxy to hold together. Shallots whole for texture; peeling tedious but worth it. Cinnamon and smoked paprika added to flour for even flavor distribution. Adjust salt at end due to broth saltiness. Meat shoulder best for slow cooking, fat renders well."
instructionsNote: "Coat pork thoroughly first with spiced flour. Brown well in ghee to lock flavors and color. Deglazing pan captures all browned bits, key depth layer. Pour broth-mustard mix over pork in cooker before adding veggies. Scatter potatoes, shallots, dates around meat so everything cooks evenly in same liquid bath. Low slow cook for about 8 hours lets connective tissues break down. Hold on warm if needed, but no more than 5 hours to avoid overcooking potatoes. Serve with liquid spooned over. Meat texture should be fork-tender but still sliceable if desired. Important to use slow cooker with sealed lid to retain moisture."
tips:
- "Brown the pork. Ghee gives nuttiness that butter lacks. Coat with flour, cinnamon, smoked paprika. Lock in flavors. Don't rush. This step matters."
- "Deglaze with vegetable broth. Get all the bits off the bottom. Those bits carry flavors. Scrape well. Mix in mustard. Use whole grain for texture."
- "Add vegetables carefully. Scatter potatoes, shallots, dates. Make sure they are submerged. Everything cooks together. This mixes flavors. Even cooking is key."
- "Cook low and slow. About 8 hours is best. Connective tissues break down. Result? Tender meat. Don't open lid often. Keep the moisture locked in."
- "Hold on warm if needed. No more than 5 hours. Overcooked potatoes lose texture. Meat should be tender, sliceable. Balance is critical."
faq:
- "q: What's the best cut for this recipe? a: Pork shoulder is ideal. Fat renders well. Results in tender texture. Other cuts? Try pork butt or chuck."
- "q: Can I substitute ingredients? a: Yes, many options. Use different veggies, like carrots or turnips. Swap ghee for oil. But flavors can change."
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Store in airtight container. Refrigerate for 3-4 days. Can freeze too. But potatoes may change texture. Use within a month."
- "q: Can I cook on high? a: Yes, but reduces flavor depth. Aim for about 4-5 hours on high. Watch closely. Not ideal but works in a pinch."
