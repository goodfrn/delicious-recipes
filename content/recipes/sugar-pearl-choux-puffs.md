ingredients:
- "1 large egg"
- "20 ml water (1 tbsp plus 1 tsp)"
- "1 (modified) batch choux pastry dough"
- "80 g pearl sugar (reduced by 20g from original)"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 195°C (385°F). Place rack center position."
- "Line two baking trays with silicone mats or parchment paper."
- "In a small bowl, whisk egg and water together until combined."
- "Chill choux dough in fridge for 15 minutes to firm up."
- "Fit piping bag with plain tip ~8 mm (slightly narrower). Fill with dough."
- "Pipe small rounds ~2 cm (just under 1 inch) diameter onto trays, spaced well."
- "Brush each mound lightly with egg-water glaze, avoid dripping."
- "Sprinkle a generous layer of pearl sugar evenly over each puff."
- "Bake one tray at a time for 27-28 minutes or until golden brown and risen."
- "Do not open oven early or puffs collapse. Even color expected."
- "Remove from oven, let cool fully on tray to keep crisp."
- "Store in airtight container at room temp up to 2 days; best same day."
- "Serve plain or with light jam for mild sweetness contrast."
introduction: "Choux puffs with crunch? Pearl sugar delivers that sweet snap unlike regular sugar. Not your fluffy hollow shells but tiny golden bubbles dotted with white sugar. Egg wash the tops before baking. Water added for thinner glaze; stops drips pooling on parchment. Bake slower. Keep dough cold, smaller piped blobs for even puffing. Timing matters: a few minutes less or more changes everything. Crisp shell, soft airy center. No gluten or dairy needed. Pearled sugar melts unevenly, crackles in oven heat. Eat fresh or lose crunch fast. Spellbinding old-school French treat without fuss."
ingredientsNote: "Original calls for 100g pearl sugar; reduced here for less sweetness and better snap. Choux dough same base but pipe smaller blobs to shorten baking time. Egg to water ratio altered for thinner glaze; prevents sugar dissolving too fast or clumping. Sugar pearls are best quality—large grains preferred. Can substitute with coarse turbinado sugar for different crunch. Dough should be well rested before piping. Keep everything chilled or dough oozes. No nuts, no gluten, no lactose means easier to share, simpler digesting. Rapid baking yields crisp crust."
instructionsNote: "Oven must be hot and stable. Preheat well before starting. Don't crowd tray, gives hot air room. Brush egg-water glaze thinly, no puddles. Too thick causes burnt spots. Pearled sugar must stick but not soak. Bake one sheet at a time for even cooking; swap trays if needed. Avoid opening the oven for first 20 minutes minimum; shells collapse if cooled too soon. Use silicone mat or parchment to prevent sticking. Once out, cooling keeps them crisp. Store airtight, no fridge—they lose crunch. Eat day of for best texture. Reheat 2 minutes if softened, but beware melting sugar blobs."
tips:
- "Dough must chill. Cold dough makes for easier piping. Stick to smaller dollops. Just 2 cm diameter. Bake one tray at a time. Air needs to circulate. Keeps puffs from collapsing. Slightly adjust bake time. Overbaking dries them out."
- "Egg and water glaze should be thin. Brush lightly. No pooling. Less likelihood of burnt spots. Pearl sugar needs to stick. But not soak into dough. Helps form crackly crust. Aim for even coverage. Keep track of space between puffs."
- "Use silicone mats when baking. Prevents sticking. Parchment works too. Don't crowd the pan. Hot air needs room to flow. Keeps puffs uniform. Store in airtight container. Room temperature only. No fridge; cold air ruins texture."
- "Reheat when softened. Just for a couple minutes. But melted sugar can become messy. Use higher heat. Crisp back up without drying out. Try serving with light jam. Adds mild sweetness contrast. Perfect combo."
- "Don’t open the oven early. About 20 minutes minimum. Internal heat needs to stay stable. Cooling on the tray keeps crisp texture. Watch for even color. Too dark means burnt. Adjust as needed for personal preference."
faq:
- "q: How long to store? a: Up to two days max in airtight container. Keep at room temp. Do not refrigerate."
- "q: Can I use regular sugar? a: Yes, but texture will change. Don't get same crunch. Stick to pearl sugar for best results."
- "q: What if puffs collapse? a: Too much moisture or opening oven. Ensure dough is cold before piping. Don't crowd pan either."
- "q: Alternatives for pearl sugar? a: Coarse turbinado sugar works fine. Different crunch though. Keep in mind it’s not exactly the same."
