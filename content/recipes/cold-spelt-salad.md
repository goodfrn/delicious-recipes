ingredients:
- "1 medium red onion finely chopped"
- "1 serrano chili deseeded finely chopped"
- "80 ml olive oil divided"
- "200 ml spelt flakes"
- "300 ml vegetable broth or water"
- "350 g fresh salmon skin removed"
- "1 ripe mango peeled diced"
- "1 English cucumber quartered lengthwise thinly sliced"
- "100 ml fresh coriander chopped"
- "1 small shallot minced"
- "40 ml lime juice"
- "Salt and black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Begin with a heavy skillet. Sweat onion and serrano in 25 ml olive oil over medium heat until softened, translucent but not browned roughly 6-8 minutes. The pan should smell fragrant, not sharp burnt. Transfer mixture to a large bowl to cool slightly."
- "In same pan, add 10 ml olive oil, toast spelt flakes stirring constantly for 2-3 minutes until aromatic and just golden. Avoid scorching—spelt darkens quickly. Pour in broth, simmer gently, stir often 9-11 minutes until flakes plump, absorb liquid. Should be tender but have bite — test a flake before finishing. Drain excess liquid if any. Immediately combine with onion mixture, stir to thoroughly distribute. Cover bowl, chill about 35 minutes until cold. Rest essential to avoid sogginess."
- "While spelt cools, heat remaining olive oil. Pat salmon dry, season with salt and pepper. Sear skinless side without moving fish for 4-5 minutes medium heat until opaque halfway up sides. Flip carefully, cook additional 5 minutes for medium doneness. Should be firm but moist, slightly flaky when poked. Remove from pan onto plate, let cool completely uncovered. Reserve any pan fond for dressings or sauces."
- "Add mango, cucumber, coriander, shallot, lime juice to chilled spelt bowl. Toss gently but thoroughly. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Incorporating these fresh ingredients last keeps texture crisp and flavors bright."
- "Break salmon into large flakes; distribute evenly over salad either gently folding through or on top portioned into individual servings. Serve immediately or chilled. If not serving promptly, keep salmon and salad separate to avoid mushiness. Reheat no, salmon best cold or room temp."
- "Use serrano instead of jalapeño for sharper heat; mango instead of avocado for sweetness, acidic balance plus vibrant color. Mango can be swapped back with avocado if creamy texture preferred, but softer avocado risks mushing when mixed ahead. Choice depends on texture priority."
introduction: "Cold spelt salad—texture contrasts, fresh herbs, pan-seared salmon chunks. No mush here, no soggy blobs of avocado. Mango adds a juicy snap, bright sweetness. Heat from serrano, a sharper kick than jalapeño, slices through richness. You want layers of flavor and textures. Toasting spelt flakes unlocks nutty aromas, acts as a flavor booster without long soaking or boiling. It absorbs broth then chills, firm and chewy. Salmon cooked gently in olive oil—the smooth sizzle, light browning signals readiness. Let it cool to retain moisture, then break into thick chunks. Everything mixed at the end, preserving juicy crisp cucumber, zip from lime, the pungent shallot. Classic technique but fresh twists; flavors punchy and nuanced."
ingredientsNote: "Spelt flakes used here instead of whole grain to save time but still deliver chewy nutty texture. Toasting before simmering extracts deeper flavor, watch carefully to avoid burning—flipped by aroma, slight color change. Broth can be vegetable or a light fish broth to deepen umami if available. Serrano chili adds a sharper, more intense spice compared to jalapeño, adjust heat by leaving in seeds or removing all. Mango ripe but firm for texture integrity. Can swap mango for avocado if creamy richness preferred but do not mix avocado until last minute—otherwise it wilts and stains the salad dull green. Fresh coriander brightens the whole dish. Shallots chosen over regular onion for their mild mild onion flavor. Lime juice adds acidity to cut fat and tie flavors, use freshly squeezed not bottled. Olive oil quality matters here; need fruity, smooth cold-pressed, not bitter overly grassy. Salt and pepper finish basic flavor profile—season gradually to taste."
instructionsNote: "Sweat onion and chili slowly—key to soften pungency without caramelizing. Watch pan temperature, lower heat as needed. Toasting spelt is brief, stir constantly. Broth addition after toasting cooks flakes gently—don’t let boil vigorously or grains will break down and paste form. Texture matters here, test frequently by tasting a flake. Transfer immediately to cool with onion mixture prevents overcooking spikes in temperature. Salmon cooking—dry surface for better sear, moderate heat, no poking or flipping until edges turn opaque—you want medium heat so outside crisps but inside remains juicy. Let cooked fish cool uncovered to avoid condensation moisture trapping. Folding mango cucumber mixture into spelt last keeps veggies crisp and fruity contrast. Flake salmon large, avoid overmixing salmon with salad to keep fish presentational and texture intact. Serve cold or room temp; reheat ruins texture and flavor layers. Leftovers keep salmon and salad separate for freshness. Good idea to reserve pan fond after salmon for quick pan sauce or drizzle purposes."
tips:
- "Toasting spelt flakes changes aroma; you want nutty, slightly golden. Stir constantly. Avoid burning. Quick. Check color and smell."
- "Properly sear salmon relies on dry skin. Heat oil, place fish skin-side down. Don't move it. Let it develop good crust. Watch edges turning opaque."
- "Chilling spelt really matters. Cover tightly. Patience needed. Let flavors marry, cool completely. No soggy textures; firm and chewy finish is key."
- "Mango swaps in for avocado bring sweetness; maintains texture integrity. Ripe but not mushy. Adjust quantity based on your preference. Firm is best."
- "If salad wilts, don't mix avocado until serving. Substitutions okay, but avoid turning colors dull. Presentation matters. Separate serving helps."
faq:
- "q: How do I properly cook spelt? a: Toast, then simmer. Watch carefully. Test flake; tender but with bite. Drain if extra broth remains."
- "q: What if my salmon is overcooked? a: Start again, lower heat. Ensure dry surface. Keep it moving minimal. End doneness, flaky but moist."
- "q: Can I prepare in advance? a: Yes and no. Salmon best fresh, but salad can chill. Pack separately for textural integrity—pre-cold is essential."
- "q: What are alternatives to spelt? a: Try quinoa for another nutty flavor. Farro works too. Adjust cooking times. Different grains yield varied textures."
