ingredients:
- "=== Tofu ==="
- "380 g firm tofu, drained and cut into large cubes"
- "12 ml low-sodium tamari"
- "28 g arrowroot powder or cornstarch"
- "12 ml avocado oil or any neutral oil"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste"
- ""
- "=== Sauce ==="
- "70 ml tahini"
- "70 ml vegetable broth (low sodium)"
- "25 ml maple syrup"
- "20 ml fresh lime juice"
- "12 ml chili garlic paste (or 1 tsp sambal oelek)"
- "15 g fresh basil or cilantro, chopped"
- "25 g toasted pumpkin seeds or roasted sunflower seeds"
instructions:
- "=== Sauce ==="
- "1. Whisk tahini, vegetable broth, maple syrup, lime juice, tamari, and chili paste in a microwave-safe bowl. Nuke for 45-60 seconds, watch it bubble gently; sauce will thicken. Stir vigorously until silky."
- ""
- "=== Tofu ==="
- "2. Line air fryer basket with parchment—helps prevent sticking. Toss tofu with tamari until fully coated. Sprinkle arrowroot or cornstarch evenly, tossing gently so cubes get a thin, dry coating that crisps up well."
- ""
- "3. Drizzle oil over tofu cubes. Toss again. Season lightly with salt and black pepper. Don't over-salt; tamari is salty."
- ""
- "4. Spread cubes out in single layer inside basket. No overcrowding or they'll steam instead of crisp. Air fry at 195°C (385°F) for 8 minutes. Listen for faint crackle starts. Stop, shuffle tofu gently to flip and redistribute heat."
- ""
- "5. Continue air frying 9-10 minutes more. Look for golden crust developing with spots of deep brown. Texture should feel firm and crisp outside but not brittle. Too long and tofu will dry out—avoid."
- ""
- "6. Transfer hot tofu to mixing bowl. Pour warmed satay sauce over tofu, toss with care. Use silicone spatula to coat every piece without breaking."
- ""
- "7. Sprinkle fresh herbs and toasted seeds on top. Seeds add crunch and nuttiness without peanuts. Basil introduces herbal lift. Perfect with steamed jasmine or brown rice and sautéed greens like bok choy or kale."
- ""
- "=== Notes ==="
- " - If no air fryer, bake tofu on parchment-lined tray at 220°C (425°F) turning halfway, total 20-25 mins. Watch crisp carefully."
- " - Arrowroot powder substitutes for cornstarch for cleaner finish and lighter crust."
- " - Tahini subverts classic peanut sauce; better for nut allergies, slightly earthier flavour that plays well with lime and chili."
- " - Chili garlic paste provides more dimension than plain sambal."
- " - Use parchment cut to fit basket for easy clean-up and crisper bottom layer."
- " - Avoid overcrowding basket or cubes will steam and lose crunch."
- " - Adjust air fryer temperature by 5 degrees as units vary; experience your machine."
- " - Maple syrup brings sweetness and caramelization without overpowering."
introduction: "Firm tofu. Blot dry. Moisture kills crisp. Douse in tamari; lets flavor soak deeply before cooking. Cornstarch or arrowroot dusts exterior. Why arrowroot? Clear, light crust that shatters with bite. Oil coats cubes lightly; too much drowns crisp. Air fryer hits high heat swiftly, making that crackly texture you want.  Air circulation—key. No crowd, or all get soggy steam bath. Satay sauce? Tahini swap instead of peanuts. Allergy-safe but still creamy, rich, with subtle bitterness. Chili garlic paste punches heat plus garlicky aroma. Microwave warms and thins sauce fast; steam tells when hot enough. Fresh lime juice injects brightness and balances sweet maple notes perfectly. Toasted pumpkin seeds crunch the party—no peanuts, no problem. Herbaceous finish—basil or cilantro—adds green freshness. Stirred sauce, folded tofu, each piece glistens under sauce like jewels ready to devour. Rice and greens on side—simple but necessary. Cooking cues like sound and feel over timer stand out. No rigid clocks in kitchen. Smell popping oil, see golden edges, touch firm crust. That’s when it’s done. Practical, allergy-conscious, and just right."
ingredientsNote: "Firm tofu needs thorough pressing and drying—moisture defeats crisp crust. Tamari better than soy sauce here; less salty, richer depth. Arrowroot powder or cornstarch forms the protective shell maximizing crunch. Oil: neutral flavor, high smoke point—avocado, canola, or grapeseed. Sauce swap—tahini for peanut butter cuts allergen risk, keeps richness. Vegetable broth replaces chicken stock; vegetarian, lighter, adds umami without overpowering. Chili garlic paste not only heat but aroma—sambal works if you lack fresh chili. Maple syrup brings balanced sweetness more complex than regular sugar. Use fresh lime for acidity; bottled won't cut it. Toasted pumpkin or sunflower seeds add nutty texture without peanuts—a common allergy substitution. Fresh herbs like basil or cilantro bring lift and color, important finishing note."
instructionsNote: "Parchment in air fryer basket? Game changer. Prevents sticking, encourages even airflow under tofu. Toss tofu well but gently to coat evenly; clumps of starch ruin texture. Salt after starch to avoid moisture leeching from tofu prematurely. Air fryer temp and time vary; visual cues trump timers. Listen for faint crackles as indicator of crisp onset. Flip halfway; redistributes heat and avoids soggy spots underneath. Sauce microwaving is fast and efficient; watch closely to avoid breaking. Stir until glossy—separation signals overheating. Combine sauce with tofu off heat to preserve texture and brightness. Herbs and toasted seeds sprinkled last keep crunchy and fresh. Overcrowding in basket traps steam—kills crisp. Spread out cubes. If no air fryer, baking at higher temp or broiling briefly post-bake can mimic crisp but watch closely. Timing adjustments ±5 mins account for air fryer model variances and cube size differences."
tips:
- "Choose firm tofu; moisture is enemy. Press and dry well. Tamari helps flavors soak in deep. Arrowroot for light, crispy shell. Don't drown cubes in oil; too much spoils crisp."
- "Watch the air fryer sound. Listen for crackling; it's your cue! Flip midway to avoid soggy mush down. Aim for even spacing; crowded basket means soft tofu. Bake instead? Higher heat, watch closely."
- "Substitutions matter. Maple syrup brings sweet without overpowering. Swap tahini for any nut butter if needed, but stick with earthiness. Vegetable broth over chicken for umami, lighter base."
- "Fresh herbs at end keep it vibrant. Basil or cilantro for that pop. Don't skimp on toasted seeds—all about crunch. Skip the pastes if no chili garlic; use your favorite red pepper flakes."
- "Use parchment in air fryer basket. Game changer for sticking, and crisping. Stir sauce until glossy; avoid separation. Warm until just bubbling; too hot ruins texture."
