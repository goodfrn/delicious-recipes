description: "Stacked sliders with sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs, and cheese on sweet Hawaiian rolls. Baked to melty, golden perfection. Topped with a savory butter glaze and everything but the bagel seasoning. Includes easy sriracha mayo for a spicy kick. Swaps ground pork for breakfast turkey sausage and Monterey Jack for cheddar. Uses deli ham in place of bacon. Timing adjusted slightly for perfect melt and crust. Layering preserves moisture and creates textural contrast between soft rolls and crisped topping. Practical tips on cutting rolls, managing moisture, and efficient pan use included."

ingredients:
- "12 sweet Hawaiian sandwich rolls"
- "1 pound breakfast turkey sausage, casings removed"
- "8 large eggs"
- "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided"
- "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided"
- "8 slices sharp cheddar cheese"
- "8 slices Monterey Jack cheese"
- "6 slices deli ham, chopped"
- "1/2 cup melted unsalted butter"
- "2 teaspoons everything but the bagel seasoning"
- "3 tablespoons mayonnaise"
- "1 teaspoon sriracha sauce"
- "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh chives (optional)"
instructions:
- "Heat oven to 345°F. Line half sheet pan with parchment; set aside."
- "In a medium skillet over medium, crumble and cook turkey sausage till no pink remains and edges start to brown, roughly 7 minutes. Drain on paper towels to remove excess fat; keep skillet handy."
- "Reduce heat to low. Whisk eggs with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Pour into skillet; stir gently to create soft curds just shy of fully set. Remove from heat while still slightly shiny; carryover cooking finishes them."
- "Slice whole Hawaiian rolls horizontally, keeping them attached. Leave bottom half on parchment. Check cuts with serrated knife to avoid squashing rolls; slow sawing motion works best."
- "Layer 8 cheddar slices evenly on bottom half. This barrier prevents soggy bread from sausage moisture."
- "Spread cooked turkey sausage across cheddar evenly. Follow quickly with diced ham pieces. Together they punch up savory notes without greasy overload."
- "Evenly distribute scrambled eggs atop meat layers. Pat gently to fill gaps but avoid compression that makes eggs rubbery."
- "Place Monterey Jack slices on top of eggs. These melt differently than cheddar—mellower, creamier texture."
- "Cover with top half of rolls. Brush generously with melted butter, don't skimp—this directs browning and gives that irresistible golden crust and aroma."
- "Sprinkle everything but the bagel seasoning over buttered tops. Bite into crunch and pop of toasted garlic, sesame, onion. Avoid black pepper spikes here—already seasoned inside."
- "Tent loosely with foil. Bake 16-22 minutes. Watch for bubbling cheese edges and tops turning light amber. The foil traps steam for melt but prevents premature crust burn."
- "Remove foil; bake an extra 7-12 minutes uncovered. Look for deep golden tops and hot fillings. Insert skewer to test temperature if in doubt. Overbaking dries rolls, underbaking leaves cold pockets."
- "While baking, mix mayo and sriracha for a bright, creamy drizzle. Adjust heat to taste. Store chilled until serving."
- "Garnish with chopped chives if desired for fresh bite and color."
- "Slice into 12 sliders with serrated knife using gentle sawing to maintain layers intact. Serve warm with sriracha mayo on side."
introduction: "Forget fuss. Simple layering builds flavor and texture. Sweet Hawaiian rolls hold up better than typical buns if you're precise with cuts; too aggressive will ruin structure. Turkey sausage swaps in for pork if you want less grease, keeps spices but yields leaner bite. Ham replaces bacon—lower fat, subtle smoky punch without overwhelming salt. Cheese duo offers sharpness and creaminess; mix cheeses boldly to avoid monotony. Butter on top is critical—skip it and tops stay pale, uninviting. Everything but the bagel seasoning is your shortcut flavor punch, goes great on melted butter. Timing is about eye and feel, not just minutes. Watch for golden edges and melted, bubbling cheese. Don't overcook eggs in skillet—carryover heat finishes them while baking. Sriracha mayo brightens and cuts richness at serving. Get hands dirty building layers, seal edges for less drips. Messy, yes, but worth every bite."
ingredientsNote: "Using turkey sausage helps cut down grease that weighs down rolls and prevents sogginess; if pork is preferred, drain well after cooking. Deli ham's milder profile replaces bacon's crisp fattiness; it won’t give that same crunch but adds salt and umami without extra grease—bacon lovers can crisp and drain before adding. Monterey Jack melts beautifully but is milder; sharp cheddar adds bite. Double cheese layers create moisture barriers so rolls stay soft, not soggy. Butter must be melted but not browned; too hot and it fries tops unevenly. Everything but the bagel seasoning adds garlic, onion, sesame crunch—can swap for sesame seeds and garlic powder if unavailable. Fresh chives optional, but add fresh herbal brightness against heavy sausage and cheese. Eggs separated from strong seasoning prevent over-salting; add salt gradually and taste. Parchment paper saves cleanup and keeps bottoms from crisping too much. Serrated knife essential for clean rolls cut; use slow smooth sawing motion."
instructionsNote: "Sausage cooking is about rendering fat and breaking up large chunks. Drain in layers of paper towel to keep filling from watery mess. Eggs must be soft and slightly glossy on removal from heat—overcooked eggs end up dry when baked again. Slicing rolls before layering but keeping them attached lets you stack without spillage and holds heat better. Cheese on both bottom and top layers acts as melting cushion and moisture lock, preventing bread from getting soggy. Brush butter carefully, don’t soak the tops or you’ll risk greasy slides. Foil tent traps steam for melting without burning; removing foil late in bake encourages browning and crisp edge. Visual cues critical: orange-gold hue on crust; bubbling cheese edges; steam gently rising. Shoulders of timer should be flexible, go by smell of butter browning and visuals rather than clock alone. Let sliders rest 5 minutes after baking if possible to let layers settle and firm. Mixing sriracha mayo last preserves fresh spice note and requires no cooking. Slice with serrated knife in controlled gentle sawing strokes to keep layers neat. Serving with sriracha mayo cools heat and cuts richness, encourage dipping instead of slathering to avoid mess."
tips:
- "Watch the cheese closely while baking. Bubbling edges mean it’s nearly there. Melting nicely; no burning allowed. Foil helps with steam but remove to brown."
- "When scrambling eggs, low and slow. Avoid the rubbery issue; keep mixture soft, shiny. Do not rush—it needs to be tender—carryover cooks while baking."
- "Layer ingredients intentionally. Cheese first; keeps moisture at bay. Follow with meats. Eggs last, prevent sogginess. Create a solid structure with clear separation."
- "Use parchment paper under rolls to simplify cleanup. It helps crust from becoming too much. Quick tip—cut rolls while together, saves structure when stacking."
- "Mix sriracha mayo just before serving. Fresh flavors shine then. Use two fork blends; modifies hotness. Serve on side, gives control over heat."
faq:
- "q: How to reheat leftovers? a: Oven at 350°F. Wrap in foil, heat until warm. Crisp top for a few minutes, texture returns. Use air fryer for crunch too."
- "q: Can I use regular sausage? a: Yes; just drain well. Consider fat content; pork creates greasiness. Turkey is lighter, balances flavors, keeps rolls dry."
- "q: What to do if rolls get soggy? a: Layering processing, critical. Make sure cheese barrier held. If soggy, find balance in moisture; avoid lots of liquid filling."
- "q: How to store sliders? a: Airtight container refrigerated; lasts 2-3 days. Freeze if long term—wrap tightly in foil or plastic. Use parchment again for crispness."
