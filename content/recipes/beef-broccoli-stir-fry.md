ingredients:
- "12 ounces flank steak sliced thin against grain"
- "2 tablespoons tamari soy sauce divided"
- "2 tablespoons mirin or dry sherry"
- "3 tablespoons oyster sauce"
- "1 teaspoon fresh grated ginger or 1/2 teaspoon ginger powder"
- "1 clove garlic minced or 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder"
- "1 tablespoon brown sugar"
- "1 cup low sodium beef or vegetable broth divided"
- "1 tablespoon cornstarch"
- "2 tablespoons vegetable oil or toasted sesame oil"
- "4 cups broccoli florets"
- "2 green onions sliced thin"
- "1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds"
- "Steamed rice for serving"
instructions:
- "Slice flank steak very thin, toss with 1 tablespoon tamari and mirin. Let sit 10-15 minutes at room temp. Don't drown it; just coat."
- "Whisk oyster sauce, remaining tamari, ginger, garlic, brown sugar in small bowl. Reserve for later."
- "Put 1/4 cup beef broth in another bowl. Sprinkle in cornstarch, stir smooth. Add remaining broth and mix into sauce bowl. Slurry helps avoid clumps, gives glossy sauce."
- "Drain steak well, shake off marinade. Too much liquid cools pan, messes sear."
- "Heat skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add oil. Wait until oil shimmers near smoking and water drop sizzles instantly."
- "Add beef in single layer, stir-fry 3-4 minutes. Color matters—edges should darken and caramelize, don’t crowd pan or meat will steam, lose texture."
- "Pull beef out onto plate. No need to wipe pan; leave fond for sauce flavor."
- "Add splash (2-3 tablespoons) water to pan base. You want just enough to create steam, not boil. Toss in broccoli florets."
- "Lower heat slightly. Simmer broccoli 4-5 minutes, toss frequently until broccoli is vibrant green and tickles fork just right—tender but still bright snap."
- "Pour half sauce over broccoli. Stir and let thicken while simmering 2 minutes. Watch consistency, moves from runny to velvety."
- "Return beef to pan. Stir to coat thoroughly, add leftover sauce if you want it extra wet. Let everything meld and thicken another 1-2 minutes."
- "Taste and adjust: more soy or sugar if bland. Add chili flakes or splash of rice vinegar for brightness."
- "Plate over steamed rice. Top with sliced green onions and sprinkle toasted sesame seeds on top for crunch and nuttiness."
- "Serve hot. Leftovers reheat well—add splash water if sauce tightens too much."
introduction: "Beef and broccoli—classic combo but demands respect when cooking. Thin meat slices, quick sear over high heat, no crowding or moisture stealing your crust. Broccoli should steam slightly, retaining crunch and that brilliant green. Sauce thickened with cornstarch slurry, not flour or arrowroot to keep gloss and texture right. Brown sugar and mirin add depth, no need for overly sweet or cloying sauces. You’ll hear that satisfying sizzle, see caramelization edges forming. Broccoli steaming gives you that faint whistle and aroma shift. Mixing prepared sauce in steps, careful slurry integration, saves you lumps and bland sauce mishaps. Skip the supermarket bottled variations—they're messier and watered down. Handle ingredients right, timing is your ally; it’s simple but demands focus. Splash water for steam is kitchen hack, no extra pans, no fuss."
ingredientsNote: "Flank or skirt steak sliced thin is key—thick chunks won’t cook fast enough, dry out. Tamari swaps soy for gluten-free option, or coconut aminos if watching sodium. Mirin adds sweetness and umami; dry sherry substitutes well but skip if alcohol concerns. Oyster sauce adds savoriness but replace with hoisin or mushroom sauce for vegetarian twist. Fresh ginger and garlic paste can be powdered in pinch; fresh preferable but powdered works well. Broccoli sized uniformly for even cooking. Cornstarch slurry—don’t mix directly into hot sauce; that causes clumping and lumps. Vegetable oil holds high heat; toasted sesame oil finishes adds aroma but burns fast, use carefully. Green onions and sesame seeds optional but worthwhile for final contrast."
instructionsNote: "Marinate briefly at room temperature; fridge chills slow cooking and extract less flavor. Good sear means hot, dry pan and well-drained steak. Wait for oil to properly heat, test with water drop—instant sizzle is visual cue. Don’t overcrowd pan or meat steams. Remove beef promptly to avoid toughening. Reuse fond, no scraping but gentle toss. Steam broccoli with minimal water so it doesn’t drown or get soggy—color change from dull to vibrant signals done. Sauce goes in halves to control thickness and coating. Stir and watch sauce transform from thin to clingy. Meat returns with sauce, reheated just enough to warm, not toughen. Adjust flavor last moment: salt, acidity, heat. Use chopped onions and seeds at finish for texture layers. Serving over rice soaks up sauce, balances bold flavors."
tips:
- "Marinate flank steak briefly, at room temperature. Too long, loses flavor. Don’t drown it, need just a coat. Let it breathe."
- "For browning, don't crowd the pan. If too much, meat steams, tough. Test oil with water drop—shimmering oil is ready. Sizzle means heat."
- "Add broth carefully. Slurry first, then mix in sauce gradually. Avoid clumps. Stir until it thickens, takes just a few minutes. Watch closely for gloss."
- "Use fresh ginger and garlic over powdered when possible. They pack flavor and aroma. If not, adjust amounts—powder is concentrated, a bit more."
- "Check broccoli during steaming. Look for that bright green. Fork should pierce but not mushy. Too long, ends get soggy, lose crunch."
- "Not just beef! Sub chicken or tofu as protein. Adjust cook times for different meats. Quick sear is key for texture."
- "Extra sauce? Return with beef, let it absorb flavors. Drizzle in at the end for more richness. Always taste, adjust soy or sugar."
- "Use green beans or snap peas instead of broccoli—adjust steam time. Fresh is best, frozen makes it tricky. Soggy worries."
- "Thought about sesame oil? Use with caution. Add at end to finish flavor without burning. High heat looms."
- "Storage? Refrigerate leftovers in airtight container. Reheat gently, add splash water. Sauce can tighten, adjust for consistency."
faq:
- "q: How do I get my beef tender? a: Cut against grain, marinade helps. If chewy, too thick slices or overcooked. Watch sear."
- "q: What if my broccoli gets soggy? a: Steam only until bright green. Fork test keeps it crunchy. No boiling, just steam lightly."
- "q: Can I prep this dish ahead? a: Yes, but cook rice fresh. Beef can marinate a bit longer for ideal flavor. Broccoli last minute."
- "q: How long does leftover stir-fry last? a: Store in fridge up to three days. Freeze not recommended; texture changes. Reheat gently."
