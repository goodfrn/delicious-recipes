ingredients:
- "3 medium sweet potatoes, peeled or not, cut into large cubes"
- "25 ml vegetable oil"
- "200 g broccoli florets cut small"
- "160 g frozen corn kernels, blanched briefly"
- "5 radishes thinly sliced into quarters"
- "3 scallions thinly sliced"
- "70 ml Vietnamese dipping sauce (nuoc cham)"
- "160 g cooked shredded chicken"
- "Spicy mayonnaise (store-bought or homemade), for drizzle"
- "40 g fresh coriander leaves with stems"
- "40 g roasted peanuts crushed"
- "1 lime cut into wedges"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to around 195 °C (385 °F). Rack in center. Have baking sheet ready with parchment or silicone liner."
- "Toss sweet potato cubes with oil, salt, fresh ground black pepper. Spread out to avoid crowding for even roasting. Roast about 17 to 20 minutes until edges caramelize; flip halfway. Look for golden color, fork-tender but firm inside."
- "Meanwhile, combine broccoli, corn, radish, scallions in bowl. Add nuoc cham sauce. Stir to coat. Let sit 12-15 minutes, stirring occasionally to macerate but not soggy. Drain well using sieve or cheesecloth, pressing gently to remove excess liquid. Wet veggies kill texture."
- "Add shredded chicken to veggies. Toss lightly. Keep chicken cold until assembly for freshness."
- "Plate sweet potatoes hot or warm as base. Generous drizzle of spicy mayo over sweet potatoes for creaminess and heat contrast."
- "Top with veggie-chicken mixture. Scatter cilantro leaves and stems evenly for herbal punch. Sprinkle crushed peanuts last for crunch and nutty aroma."
- "Serve immediately with lime wedges to squeeze over for brightness and acidity."
- "Optional tweak: swap peanuts with toasted cashews for buttery notes, and replace nuoc cham with a mix of soy sauce, lime juice, and a pinch of brown sugar for different flavor profile."
introduction: "Sweet potatoes roasting. That earthy-sweet aroma saturates the kitchen. You want chunks browned—not mushy. Broccoli tossed raw with corn, radishes, scallions. Fresh, crisp, not drenched—texture matters. The nuoc cham soak softens veggies while keeping a bite. Too wet? The salad turns limp, flavor dulls. Chicken shredded cold folds in last, keeps the salad cool, makes it substantial. Mayo drizzle adds creamy heat—cut with brightness from lashings of lime and fresh coriander greenery. Toasted peanuts crunch. Salt, fat, acid, sweet, crunch, chew. Keep components separate where texture demands. Roast sweet potato right—not underdone, not falling apart. Timing is everything. The difference between meh and memorable."
ingredientsNote: "Adjust sweet potatoes by size—aim for uniform chunks for even roasting. Oil quantity varies based on potato dryness; do not drown cubes. Frozen corn must be blanched quickly in boiling water (1-2 minutes max) then ice bathed to preserve bite and color—blanched but crisp. Radishes provide sharpness; if unavailable, turnips or fresh cucumber slices stand in. Nuoc cham sometimes harsh—balance with honey or maple syrup if too sharp. Shredded chicken can be pre-cooked thighs for moistness; leftover roast chicken works well. Peanuts add crunch but slippery ground nuts like almonds or pecans offer different mouthfeel. Coriander stems have bold flavor—don’t discard. Lime juice brightens—never substitute with vinegar here, acid note differs."
instructionsNote: "Oven preheat critical for caramelization; cold pan keeps potatoes steaming not roasting. Spread potatoes single layer, spaced. Flip for golden all around; lightly browned edges snap crisp. Check doneness by piercing cubes gently—should catch slight resistance, not flop. Vegetables soak in nuoc cham to soften but drain thoroughly or salad sogs. Drain with spoon pressure, avoid heavy pressing to preserve texture. Mix chicken in cold to avoid wilting veggies and diluting sauce. Assemble hot base and cold topping fast to avoid steam wilt. Mayonnaise drizzle should be thin ribbons, too much masks. Lime juice last step to keep brightness alive. Peanuts crushed fresh punch over pre-ground powder lacks this. Serve soon after assembly."
tips:
- "Use uniform sweet potato cubes for roasting. Size matters here. Messy chunks burn while smaller pieces can mush. Aim for 2-3 cm. Dark, caramelized edges look good."
- "Don’t crowd sweet potatoes on the baking sheet. Let them breathe, crisp not steam. Flip halfway for evenness. Watch closely when roasting. Timing—everything."
- "Blanch frozen corn fast. Boil water, ice bath ready. 1-2 minutes max. Keep that vibrant color. For radishes, consider turnips as a swap. Crunch needed."
- "Coriander stems have flavor. Don’t toss them. They’re essential for depth. Shredded chicken? Could be thigh meat for moisture. Roast leftovers work fine too."
- "Spicy mayo drizzle—use a thin hand. Too much coats and hides. Balance creaminess with sharp lime juice. Squeeze fresh right before serving for brightness."
faq:
- "q: How do I prevent soggy salad? a: Drain veggies well after soaking in nuoc cham. Press gently. Avoid heavy presses. Fresh mix keeps crunch."
- "q: What if my sweet potatoes are undercooked? a: Keep roasting, check often. Fork should pierce but resist. Color—should caramelize. Adjust time next round."
- "q: Nutritional subs—can I swap ingredients? a: Sure, use cashews instead of peanuts. Swap nuoc cham for soy sauce and lime mix—different flavor."
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Refrigerate but keep components separate. Roasted, cold, veg, chicken all apart. Reheat sweet potatoes only when serving."
