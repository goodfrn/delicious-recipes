ingredients:
- "1 sheet puff pastry (about 250g)"
- "500g mixed mushrooms sliced"
- "2 medium onions thinly sliced"
- "2 tablespoons olive oil"
- "3 eggs"
- "150ml crème fraîche"
- "150g Swiss cheese grated"
- "1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves"
- "1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika"
- "Salt and pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 190C (375F)."
- "Heat olive oil in large pan over medium. Add onions, cook slowly until soft and golden, about 15 minutes."
- "Add mushrooms to onions, stir, cook for 8-10 minutes until moisture evaporates. Season with thyme, paprika, salt, and pepper."
- "Roll puff pastry on baking sheet, prick with fork to prevent rising. Blind bake for 10 minutes."
- "In bowl, whisk eggs with crème fraîche and half the grated Swiss cheese. Add little salt and pepper."
- "Spread mushroom and onion mixture evenly on pre-baked pastry."
- "Pour egg and cheese mixture over the top."
- "Sprinkle remaining cheese on surface."
- "Bake in oven for 25 minutes until custard is set and top is golden."
- "Cool slightly before slicing into 8 pieces."
introduction: "Mushrooms and onions. Earthy and sweet. Crisp puff pastry base. Eggs binding it all together. Swiss cheese brings gentle melt, not sharp. Smoked paprika, subtle warmth. Thyme fresh and green. No nuts, pure vegetarian. Baking time tweaked, a trade between soft and crisp. Begins with slow onion caramel—patience rewards. Layers form. Rich but not heavy. Snack or dinner, versatile. Eight portions, share or keep all. Linger on the smell. Savor the texture. Comfort food with a twist."
ingredientsNote: "Puff pastry forms the structure, buy ready-made or homemade if you prefer. Mixed mushrooms bring complexity; button, cremini, shiitake work well. Onions caramelized slowly to unlock sweetness, patience matters. Crème fraîche replaces the usual heavy cream, lighter and tangy. Swiss cheese replaced gruyere for a milder but creamy melt. Thyme and smoked paprika deepen aroma, paprika smoked to avoid sharpness. Olive oil chosen for gentle flavor. Adjust salt carefully, mushrooms absorb well. Eggs bind but keep custard soft. Quantities altered slightly to balance moisture and texture, less cream, more cheese."
instructionsNote: "Begin with peeling and slicing mushrooms and onions thinly. Heat oil low, slow cook onions for 15 minutes to caramelize, dark amber color signals readiness. Mushrooms added afterward to avoid overcooking. Seasoning early allows flavors to meld. Roll puff pastry on lined sheet, prick holes to stop puffing. Blind baking fixes base, keeps crisp against moist filling. Whisk eggs and crème fraîche thoroughly, add cheese gradually to avoid lumps. Spread filling gently, pour custard evenly to seep into mushrooms. Bake at 190C for 25 minutes, watch for golden top and set custard—wobbly not acceptable. Cool on rack; slicing too hot breaks structure. Ideal served slightly warm."
tips:
- "Sauté onions low and slow. Patience is key. Dark amber indicates readiness. Adds sweet depth. Don't rush it."
- "Blind bake puff pastry. Crucial step. Otherwise, soggy bottom. Prick with fork before baking. Stops rising too much."
- "Use mixed mushrooms for complexity. Button, cremini, shiitake all work well. Different flavors, different textures. Elevate the dish."
- "When adding herbs, thyme adds fresh note. Smoked paprika deepens flavor. Both play nicely together."
- "Cool slightly before slicing. Hot filling can break structure. Let it set a bit. Serve warm for best taste."
faq:
- "q: Can I use different cheese? a: Yes. Choose a mild cheese. Avoid strong flavors. They can overpower subtle mushroom notes."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate covered for up to three days. Reheat in oven. Avoid microwave if possible."
- "q: Can I freeze it? a: Yes, but best to freeze before baking. Wrap well. Bake straight from freezer; adjust time."
- "q: What other fillings work? a: Spinach and ricotta for a twist. Broccoli and cheddar too. Adapt to taste and preference."
