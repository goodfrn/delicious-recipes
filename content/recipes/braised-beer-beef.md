- "2 cloves garlic, minced"
- "330 ml light craft beer"
- "200 ml chicken stock"
- "100 g spicy andouille sausage, sliced or diced"
- "200 g wide egg noodles"
- "50 ml unsalted butter"
- "50 ml chicken stock"
- "1 tsp fresh thyme leaves, minced"
- "Salt and pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 175 C. Rack positioned center."
- "Heat oil in heavy ovenproof pot. Brown beef cubes in batches. Salt and pepper. Remove to plate."
- "In same pot, add onions and yellow bell pepper. Cook until softened, add oil if pot looks dry."
- "Stir in diced tomato and garlic. Cook 1-2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper."
- "Return beef to pot. Pour beer and chicken stock. Bring to boil on stovetop."
- "Cover with lid, place in oven. Braise 2 hours, check tenderness."
- "Stir in andouille sausage. Remove lid. Continue cooking uncovered for 40 minutes. Stir occasionally."
- "Meanwhile, bring salted water to boil. Cook egg noodles until tender. Drain well."
- "In noodle pot, melt butter with chicken stock and thyme over low heat."
- "Return noodles to pot, toss to coat, seasoning with salt and pepper."
- "Serve beef braise spooned over noodles. Green beans or haricots verts make a crisp side."
introduction: "Chunks of beef shoulder, seared well. Onion bites with yellow bell pepper, a softer sweetness than red. Garlic and tomato for a base. Add a pale craft beer of choice, something light enough to not overpower but enough to sharpen edges. Chicken stock joins in for some body. Long slow meld in oven, 2 hours until fork-tender. Then smoky andouille sausage—not chorizo this time—for a twist, added for the last stretch uncovered. Noodles boiled, butter and thyme teamed up and poured over. Simple side for something rustic. Beans green and crisp. No fuss, all depth."
ingredientsNote: "Reduced beef quantity by about 30% to tweak portions, olive oil dropped slightly. Swapped red bell pepper out for yellow, smoother but similar brightness. Andouille sausage replaces chorizo for a smoky heat, slightly different spice but same punch. Beer dose lessened, chicken stock too, balances wetness. Butter quantity cut back, just enough to coat noodles without heaviness. Fresh thyme for herbal note, salt and pepper straightforward. Egg noodles still wide and eggy, the foundation under. Keep ingredients straightforward, no nuts, no lactose (butter can be swapped if needed)."
instructionsNote: "Start searing on stovetop to get color then shift to oven for patience cooking. Browning batches keeps meat from steaming. Softer veggies cook after meat to keep layers of flavor intact. Tomato and garlic brief to avoid bitterness. Beer and chicken stock bring liquid, boil first to mix. Cooking time shifted 5-10 minutes down for oven variability. Adding sausage late leaves it intact, not rubbery. Noodles quick in salted water; draining is key. Butter mixed with broth warms and keeps noodles from sticking, thyme added for subtle notes. Serve beef atop noodles, green beans alongside for crunch. No complicated garnishes, just straight food."
tips:
- "Start searing beef well. Brown in batches. Keep heat high at first, lower when needed. Prevent steaming. Color enhances flavor. Patience is essential. Don't rush the process. Let meat rest after browning. It helps."
- "Cut veggies smaller, softer bell pepper is key. Yellow bell is sweeter than red. Adds nice sweetness. Cook them after beef for layered flavor. Onion needs softening. Garlic and tomato brief cooking so they stay bright."
- "Braising time is crucial. Adjust based on your oven. Check after two hours. Fork-tender is the goal. If not tender yet, keep braising more. Sausage added late helps keep texture. Uncover for last 40 minutes for absorption."
- "Noodles cook quickly. Salted water is a must. Drain them well, not too sticky. Butter must melt nicely with broth. Low heat to combine. Add thyme for herbal touch. Toss noodles gently. Keep them warm."
- "Serving tip: beef on top of noodles is best. It soaks into the pasta. Flavors blend well. Green beans on the side provide crunch. Fresh herbs can also add brightness. Skip complicated garnishes. Keep it straightforward."
faq:
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Store in airtight container. Fridge for several days. Reheat gently. Add broth to keep moist. Can freeze too. But best enjoyed fresh."
- "q: Can I use different sausage? a: Absolutely. Other smoked sausages work. Choose based on flavor preference. Options like kielbasa or smoked turkey. Each offers unique twist."
- "q: What if beef is tough? a: Slice thinner for tenderness. Longer braising helps. Adjust simmering time. Keep checking until fork-tender. Patience is vital for results."
- "q: Can I make this ahead? a: Yes, prepare day before. Flavors deepen over time. Just reheat slowly before serving. Noodles are fresh last minute. Ensure texture remains."
