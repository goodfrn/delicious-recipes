ingredients:
- "8 large egg yolks"
- "1/3 cup dry white vermouth"
- "12 tbsp unsalted butter melted"
- "2 tbsp fresh lemon juice"
- "1 tsp lemon zest finely grated"
- "3 dashes Tabasco or your preferred hot sauce"
- "Freshly ground black pepper"
- "6 large eggs"
- "4 English muffins split and toasted"
- "8 slices thick-cut smoked ham"
- "4 cups fresh spinach"
- "1 tbsp white vinegar"
- "Cooking spray or neutral oil"
- "Fresh chives snipped for garnish"
instructions:
- "Heat a medium saucepan with 1 inch water. Bring to gentle simmer, not boiling. Place a heatproof bowl on top ensuring it does not touch the water."
- "Whisk egg yolks and vermouth briskly in a separate bowl until combined. Transfer to bowl over simmering water."
- "Whip constantly for 2-3 minutes until mixture thickens and nearly doubles in volume. It should resist the whisk but remain silky."
- "Slowly drizzle in melted butter while whisking. Add lemon juice, zest, hot sauce, and pepper. Sauce should coat back of spoon but flow."
- "Turn heat to very low. Cover loosely with a lid or foil. Stir occasionally to prevent skin forming. Sauce must stay warm, not hot."
- "Preheat oven to 210°F. Spray a sauté pan with cooking spray or a splash of oil. Brown smoked ham slices over medium-high heat until edges caramelize, about 2 minutes per side. Keep warm in oven."
- "Retain ham fat in pan. Stir in spinach and toss until just wilted, about 1-2 minutes. Avoid overcooking or wilting wet leaves."
- "Fill a heavy skillet with 2-3 inches water. Bring to gentle simmer. Add vinegar and a pinch of kosher salt."
- "Careful crack eggs one at a time into small bowls. Gently slip eggs near water surface in batches of three or four. Whites will feather; use spatula to fold loose whites back if too spread out."
- "Cook eggs 3.5-4 minutes until whites are fully opaque and set but yolks still jiggle slightly when nudged."
- "Remove eggs with slotted spoon. Drain well on paper towels."
- "Toast English muffins until golden brown and crisp. Warm on oven rack if holding."
- "Assemble: muffin base, fried ham, wilted spinach mound, gently place poached egg. Spoon warm lemon-butter sauce over top generously."
- "Sprinkle with snipped chives and freshly ground pepper. Serve immediately."
introduction: "Soft poached eggs shine brightest surrounded by crispy, savory ham and silky spinach—nothing gets lost here. Use vermouth instead of white wine for a deeper background note in sauce. Butter swirl vital. The double boiler sorted—keeps yolks from scrambling but thickens just right. Poaching eggs means patience; rushing creates thin whites and scattered membranes. Vinegar in water sharpens white solids fast; salt and quality vinegar you have, better to reach for white wine vinegar. Think texture: spinach just wilted, ham crispy around edges, muffin toasted but not charred. Assembly’s a sweet spot—eggs hot enough to melt sauce, sauce warm so it doesn’t break but doesn’t burn. A sprinkle of fresh chives wakes it all up. No gloss, just amounts changed, technique refined."
ingredientsNote: "Changed quantities to firmer proportions. Switched white wine for dry vermouth; more complexity, better acidity balance. Canadian bacon swapped for thick smoked ham slices that crisp better. Added fresh lemon zest to sauce—adds brightness while lemon juice tones fat hardness. Spinach sautéed in rendered ham fat, no extra butter needed. Cooking spray fine alternative if no ham fat leftover. English muffins toasted with care—not burnt; texture crucial, each bite must support wet egg. Use fresh eggs for poaching. Older eggs spread whites and flatten quicker, leading to watery texture and longer cook."
instructionsNote: "Starting with double boiler important to avoid scrambled sauce. Whisk yolks with vermouth first before heat—helps even cook. Whipping vigorously incorporates air; key for light sauce. Melted butter drizzled slow prevents curdling. Sauce consistency: thick but pourable—a sign you got it. Heat low once made, cover to stop skin, whisk gently often. Pan temp for ham medium-high; listen for gentle sizzle, not burning. Spinach wilts quick; it loses volume but keep some firmness. Poach eggs in vinegar water for firm whites around yolk—vigorous boil ruins shape; simmer, not boil. Cracking eggs into small bowl first prevents yolks breaking or shell fragments. Fold whites gently if stray. Serving timing key: eggs hold minimally off heat, prevents toughening. Muffins toasted last minute. Sauce scooped right over egg; Heat must be warm, not hot—too hot breaks emulsion. Garnish adds brightness and slight crunch."
tips:
- "Use fresh eggs for poaching. Older eggs spread and can ruin texture. Better stability with fresh. Test for freshness. Water test works well."
- "For sauce, whisk yolks and vermouth until thick first. Use a double boiler. Essential. Control heat. Gradual butter drizzling avoids curdle."
- "Spinach wilts quickly; do not overcook. Just toss in rendered ham fat. Bright green, slight firmness remains. Tune into that sizzle sound."
- "When poaching, vinegar sharper, holds whites. Simmer, not boil. Vigorous boil distorts eggs. Slip them in gently. Control timing carefully."
- "Timing with assembly crucial. Eggs must be hot, sauce warm but not scorching. Toast muffins just until golden and crisp. Finish just before serving."
faq:
- "q: How to prevent hollow whites? a: Use fresh eggs. Older eggs spread, create watery texture. Test freshness. Water method works."
- "q: What if sauce curdles? a: Reheat gently, whisk continuously. Adjust heat, if too hot on base. Add a splash of hot water, whisk."
- "q: Can I store leftovers? a: Yes, but keep components separate. Store eggs, sauce, and muffins. Reheat gently, avoid rubbery texture."
- "q: Alternatives for smoked ham? a: Try turkey bacon or prosciutto. Adjust cooking time, thicker slices need longer frying for crispiness."
