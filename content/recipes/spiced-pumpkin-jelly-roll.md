slug: "spiced-pumpkin-jelly-roll"
description: "A moist spiced pumpkin sponge wrapped with tangy cream cheese frosting and dusted with pumpkin pie spice and powdered sugar. Uses pumpkin puree, basic pantry staples, and a whipped cream cheese vanilla frosting variation. Focus on tactile cues to avoid drying out the cake. The batter blends wet and dry separately to maintain structure. Rolling the cake while warm prevents cracks. Chilling firms it up for neat slicing."

ingredients:
- "1 cup all-purpose flour"
- "1 tsp baking powder"
- "1/2 tsp baking soda"
- "3/4 tsp fine sea salt"
- "1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice"
- "3/4 cup pumpkin purée"
- "2/3 cup granulated sugar"
- "3 large eggs"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "For frosting:"
- "4 oz cream cheese softened"
- "1/3 cup unsalted butter softened"
- "1 cup powdered sugar sifted"
- "1/2 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1/4 tsp ground cinnamon"
- "Additional pumpkin pie spice and powdered sugar for dusting"
instructions:
- "Heat oven to 380°F. Line a 10×14-inch rimmed sheet pan tightly with parchment paper; no wrinkles. Makes cleanup and cake release simpler."
- "Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, sea salt, pumpkin pie spice in medium bowl. Sifting here aerates flour and removes lumps; optional but recommended."
- "In large bowl, beat pumpkin purée, sugar, eggs, vanilla until mixture is homogenous and slightly thickened—about 2 minutes high speed. This aerates for lighter crumb."
- "Fold dry ingredients gently into wet with spatula just until streaks disappear. Overmix kills volume."
- "Pour batter into pan; use offset spatula to spread evenly. Tap pan once on counter to level and release air bubbles. Should look glossy, uncrowded."
- "Bake 15–18 minutes; test for doneness by gently pressing center with fingertip. It should bounce back but not spring back like bread—slight give but not raw. Color deepens; edges pull slightly from paper."
- "Remove immediately from oven. Run thin knife or small offset spatula around edges to avoid sticking. Curled edges trap moisture and cause tearing if not freed."
- "Invert pan onto clean, dry kitchen towel dusted lightly with powdered sugar or flour. Peel parchment off cake. This prevents sticking when rolling."
- "Starting from the short side, roll cake and towel together while still warm but not hot. Roll gently but firmly to avoid cracks later. This pre-sets the shape."
- "Cool rolled cake completely on wire rack or counter. Warmer cake will tear when unrolled."
- "Make frosting: Beat cream cheese and butter until creamy and lump-free. Add sifted powdered sugar, vanilla, cinnamon; beat until well incorporated and spreadable but not runny. Chill if too soft."
- "Unroll cooled cake carefully; keep any cracks minimal by supporting fragile edges with hand while unrolling."
- "Spread frosting evenly, all the way to edges. Thin layer avoids gaps, thicker risks squeeze-out when rerolled."
- "Re-roll cake without towel this time, tight but gentle. Set seam side down on plate or tray."
- "Chill 2 hours or overnight. Firm frosting holds roll shape and clean slices."
- "Before serving, mix powdered sugar and pumpkin pie spice; dust on top shallowly. Wait until serving time to prevent absorption and sogginess."
- "Slice with a serrated or sharp chef’s knife; wipe blade clean between cuts for neat edges."
- "Serve as is or dollop with lightly whipped cream or scoop vanilla ice cream."
introduction: "Pumpkin and sponge cakes—tricky to balance moistness and structure. Liquid pumpkin gives deep color, tender crumb but often soggy if mishandled. Air bubbles from whipped eggs critical for springy texture. Salt sharpens flavors against sweet earthiness of pumpkin pie spice mix. Rolling while hot prevents cracks like a flexed plastic sheet. The frosting must be stable enough not to ooze out but soft enough to spread thin. Essential to chill fully before slicing. Scaled back sugar for less cloying finish. Dust spice just before serving for fresh scent and visual appeal. No frills, just technique and timing to nail it."
ingredientsNote: "Flour type matters; all-purpose is standard, but for lighter cakes use cake flour—reduce the flour amount by 2 tablespoons per cup to prevent dryness. Substitute fine table salt if coarse kosher unavailable; use less (half the amount) as table salt is denser. Pumpkin pie spice readily available or combine cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and clove. Pumpkin purée can be canned or homemade—homemade often wetter, adjust flour by slightly adding 1–2 teaspoons extra. Sugar can be substituted partially or fully with brown for richer flavor, but expect darker crumb and slightly softer texture. Cream cheese frosting requires proper room temperature ingredients to avoid lumpy or runny consistency; cold cream cheese scraps are a common blunder. Can add zest of orange or orange liqueur to frosting for twist."
instructionsNote: "Oven temps vary; use tactile cues to check doneness rather than clock alone. Finger test: light springy rebound but no dents—means sponge set yet moist. Overbaking yields dry, fragile cake prone to cracking on roll. Removing edges with knife immediately after baking prevents sticking and tearing later. Rolling warm cake with towel traps moisture and avoids cracks, but delay risks breakage. The frosting layer controls mouthfeel—too thin results in dry bites, too thick spills out and makes rolling impossible. Chill rolled cake properly; soft cake prosthetics slices clean. Dusting spice mixed with powdered sugar keeps the surface fresh and fragrant—do not do early or cake absorbs moisture and becomes soggy. If cake breaks during rolling, patch with leftover frosting or repurpose pieces in trifle or parfaits. Use serrated knife for slicing—saw gently to avoid squashing."
tips:
- "Moisture control key for sponge. Don’t overmix batter. Warm cake prevent tearing when rolling. Cracks happen if cooled too long. Watch edges for moisture."
- "Try keeping eggs at room temp; they whip air better. Rolled cake cools faster in towel. If baking unevenly, rotate pan halfway. Check for doneness through tactile cues."
- "Use parchment or silicone mat; avoid sticking. If cake does tear, patch with frosting. Thin layer on filling is best, thick would squeeze out."
- "Reduce sugar if too sweet. For richer flavor, use brown sugar. Hints of orange zest in frosting? Yes. Always sift powdered sugar—eliminate lumps."
- "Serrated knife is your friend. Clean cuts keep cake moist. Dust spices just before serving; sogginess if done too soon."
faq:
- "q: Can I make this ahead? a: Yes, roll and chill overnight. Slice when ready. Just dust spices before serving to keep surface fresh."
- "q: Tips for rolling without cracks? a: Roll tight but gentle. Warm cake is flexible. Don’t let it cool long. Practice makes it better."
- "q: Frosting too soft, what to do? a: Chill it! If too runny, add more powdered sugar gradually. Texture matters; seek spreadable consistency."
- "q: Leftovers needed storing how? a: Wrap tightly in fridge; will last 3 days max. Avoid drying by covering well. Don’t freeze; texture changes."
