title: "Tangy Blue Cheese Dressing"
slug: "tangy-blue-cheese-dressing"
description: "A creamy blue cheese dressing with a balanced tang and a bit of spicy bite. Uses a combo of mayo and Greek yogurt for body with milk thinning it out. Sharp lemon juice brightens flavors while Dijon mustard introduces complexity. Blue cheese crumbles split between folding in and blending for texture. Adjustable salt brings out depth without overwhelming. The Worcestershire replaced by a dash of hot sauce to add subtle heat and umami. Prepared by whisking wet ingredients first until slightly thick, then gently folding in cheese chunks to keep them from breaking down. Best served chilled after sitting so flavors fuse. Practical, no-nonsense, and kitchen-tested."

ingredients:
- "3/4 cup mayonnaise"
- "1/3 cup crumbled blue cheese divided"
- "1/2 cup whole milk"
- "2 tablespoons Greek yogurt"
- "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice"
- "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard"
- "1/8 teaspoon hot sauce (optional)"
- "Kosher salt to taste"
instructions:
- "Whisk together mayonnaise, Greek yogurt, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, whole milk, and half of the blue cheese crumbles in a medium bowl. Look for a slightly thick but pourable consistency, add milk or Greek yogurt slowly to adjust texture—not too thin, not pasty."
- "Taste for acidity and tang. Add hot sauce if you want subtle heat and umami layer, stir to combine."
- "Fold in remaining blue cheese crumbles gently to maintain chunk texture inside dressing; want to feel the bits distinctly, not puréed."
- "Add kosher salt incrementally; salt brings out depth in cheese and balances lemon juice. Taste after each pinch. Salt too early dulls flavors."
- "Let sit refrigerated for 10 minutes minimum to allow flavors to meld. Notice how the sharpness mellows and the dressing thickens slightly."
- "Before serving, stir once to redistribute any separated liquid. If too stiff, thin with little milk, but keep it coating, not watery."
- "Pairs with crunchy salads, buffalo wings, or as a dip. Fresh greens and crisp veggies create contrast and mouthfeel."
introduction: "Creaminess happens with mayo but too much and it gets heavy. Greek yogurt adds brightness and body but less fat. Milk thins without watering down the flavor, keep an eye on that texture. Mustard pushes complexity; lemon juice wakes it all up. Hot sauce swap from Worcestershire adds a sneaky heat and umami punch without drowning blue cheese notes. Folding cheese chunks in at the end keeps texture varied, not chalky or paste-like. Salt pulls flavor edges sharper, but adding slowly stops overdosing. Chill time is key. The dressing changes in fridge—aroma deepens, thickness slightly tightens but stays pourable. Perfect for wings or as a dip—doesn't overpower but stands up to bold flavors."
ingredientsNote: "Mayonnaise offers richness. Greek yogurt works for tang and smoothness but low or no fat yogurt risks graininess. Whole milk preferable, skim waters down flavor and weakens cohesion. Blue cheese quality makes a huge difference—crumbly, creamy styles like Roquefort or Danish blue preferred for better melt and bite. Dijon mustard better than plain yellow—sharpness and texture matter here. Lemon juice fresh, never bottled—it brightens and cuts fat feel sharply. Replacing Worcestershire with hot sauce adds a clean peppery confidence and a bit of heat, but keep optional for sensitive palates. Salt should be kosher to control salting well—table salt can confuse quantities. Crushing some crumbles at the end changes texture if desired but folding preserves chunkiness."
instructionsNote: "Always whisk wet ingredients first to avoid clumping and ensure emulsification of mustard and dairy. Watch texture carefully when adding milk—slow additions prevent soupiness or splitting. Folding in blue cheese last protects its texture; aggressive stirring breaks cheese and muddles flavor dispersion. Salt added last lets you control saltiness in real time. Refrigerate at least 10 minutes after mixing—this resting develops harmony between dairy acidity and sharp cheese flavor. Look for a sheen on surface indicating fat and water balance. If dressing separates or seems watery, a quick whisk or adding a touch more mayo or yogurt thickens properly. Shelf life refrigerated up to 1 week; blue cheese flavor intensifies with time but freshness fades. Use clean utensils to avoid bacterial contamination."
tips:
- "Adjust milk slowly. Pour in gradually to hit the right texture. Too much turns runny. Too little, too thick. Look for a silky consistency without clumps. Halfway, check it."
- "Folding in blue cheese is key. Don't mash it. Keep chunks intact. Add them last. Stir gently. Firm textures add some fun to each bite. Bit of creamy, bit of firm blue cheese works well."
- "Chill time can't be shortened. Resting helps flavors meld. 10 minutes minimum is mandatory. Notice aroma changes—sharper, more complex. Texture thickens a bit, gives body."
- "Taste adjustments matter. After adding salt, retaste frequently. Salt enhances but too much overshadows. Add incrementally—pinch after pinch. Balance tang from lemon to rich mayo."
- "Hot sauce is optional but try it. Remember, a little dash creates a different profile. Gives some umami and warmth without overpowering cheese flavor. Keeps it interesting."
faq:
- "q: How to store leftover dressing? a: Fridge, airtight container. Lasts about a week. Flavor intensifies after a few days. Stir before using."
- "q: Can I use low-fat yogurt? a: You can; just know it risks graininess. Full-fat tastes better. Creaminess is key. Choose wisely."
- "q: What if dressing is too thin? a: Add more mayo or yogurt to thicken it up. Bypass the milk. Just kind of mix in till it holds."
- "q: What to pair with this dressing? a: Crunchy salads, wings, fresh veggies. Easy combo with bold dishes, balancing flavors without being too heavy."
