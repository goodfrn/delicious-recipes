slug: "maple-glazed-salmon"
description: "Pan-sear salmon with a spicy maple glaze. Toss white beans, edamame, and broccoli with ginger-scented broth and toasted almonds. Simple ingredients, altered doses. Sauce thickens to sticky-sweet glaze. Cook vegetables until just tender, not mushy. Balance acidity and heat. Substitute toasted slivered almonds if no cashews. Skip chicken broth; use vegetable stock for vegan. Watch for fish doneness – flaky but moist. The contrast between rich salmon and hearty yet fresh salad builds a balanced plate."

ingredients:
- "=== Warm Bean Broccoli Salad ==="
- "1 small white onion, finely chopped"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) canola oil"
- "1 clove garlic, minced"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) freshly grated ginger"
- "200 ml (just under 1 cup) vegetable broth"
- "1 can (425 ml / 15 oz) white beans, drained and rinsed"
- "300 ml (1 1/4 cups) shelled edamame, thawed"
- "400 ml (1 2/3 cups) broccoli florets, trimmed small"
- "75 ml (1/3 cup) toasted almonds, sliced"
- "Salt and black pepper, to taste"
- "=== Salmon Glaze ==="
- "25 ml (1 2/3 tbsp) pure maple syrup"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) rice vinegar"
- "25 ml (1 2/3 tbsp) hoisin sauce"
- "10 ml (2 tsp) tamari sauce"
- "5-8 ml (1-1 1/2 tsp) chili garlic sauce"
- "600 g (1 1/3 lb) skinless salmon filet, cut into 4 portions"
instructions:
- "=== Warm Bean Broccoli Salad ==="
- "1. Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add onion. Salt lightly to draw out moisture and sweat—just until translucent, about 5 minutes, stirring often. Avoid browning; you want soft sweetness, no color."
- "2. Add garlic and ginger; stir constantly. The fragrance should wake the senses within 30 seconds. Don’t let garlic burn—quick, gentle cooking."
- "3. Pour in vegetable broth. Bring to a rolling boil to deglaze pan, scraping up any browned bits stuck to bottom. They deepen flavor."
- "4. Toss in the white beans; simmer until heated through, 7–8 minutes. Beans absorb broth flavor, swell slightly."
- "5. Add edamame and broccoli; return to a soft boil. Cook 5–7 minutes, stirring to distribute heat evenly. Check broccoli—should give under gentle pressure, still bright green, crisp tender. Drain some liquid if it’s too watery."
- "6. Stir toasted almonds right at the end to keep crunch. Season with salt and black pepper. Taste. Adjust acidity or salt as needed. Cover and keep warm off heat."
- "=== Maple-Glazed Salmon ==="
- "2. Mix maple syrup, rice vinegar, hoisin, tamari, and chili garlic sauce in a bowl. Set aside."
- "3. Heat a large non-stick skillet on medium-high. Swirl 15 ml (1 tbsp) canola oil to coat bottom, waits until hot but no smoking."
- "4. Pat salmon dry. Season with salt and pepper."
- "5. Place salmon in skillet, cooking skin side down if there were skin—now just one side. Sear without moving for 6 minutes until you see the edges turn opaque about 3/4 way up the fillet. The changing colors signal readiness to flip."
- "6. Flip carefully with spatula; cook 2-3 minutes more."
- "7. Pour glaze in thin stream around salmon; it will bubble and reduce fast. Tilt pan slightly; use spoon to baste fish repeatedly. When sauce thickens to syrupy consistency—glossy and coating the fish—salmon should be opaque, flakes separate with slight pressure but remain moist inside."
- "8. Remove from heat. Let rest 1-2 minutes; sauce continues to cling."
- "Serve salmon atop generous mound of the warm bean broccoli salad. Spoon extra glaze over everything. A squeeze of fresh lemon juice lifts flavors—optional but recommended."
introduction: "Haphazard workhorse meal. Salmon that hits without fuss. Glaze thick and sticky; heat cuts through fatty flesh. Veggie side anchored by white beans for heft; edamame adds pop, broccoli crunch. Ginger scent in broth—subtle but present. Simple, efficient. Switch almond for cashew, maple for brown sugar. Vegetable stock instead of chicken for vegan or allergen concern. Cook by feel over strict times. Salmon gives before fork, edges pearl opaque. Vegetables snap, no raw. Toast nuts dry for aroma and crunch. Pan-seared richness meets crisp freshness."
ingredientsNote: "Onion sweated, not browned, softens and brings out natural sweetness. Fresh grated ginger essential; powder lacks vitality. Garlic minced thinly avoids bitter chunks. Rinse canned white beans to remove excess salt and can metal taste. Shelled frozen edamame adds protein and texture; no soggy or over-thawed. Broccoli cut small for even doneness—big florets cook unevenly. Toast nuts dry to release oils and fragrance—don’t burn or flavor turns bitter. Maple syrup replaces brown sugar with swifter caramelization. Tamari for gluten-free alternative to soy sauce. Chili garlic sauce provides sharper, chunkier heat vs Sriracha’s smoothness. Skinless salmon filet easier to cook evenly; whole fillet with skin keeps fish intact if sliced unevenly."
instructionsNote: "Cook onions gently, sweat until translucent—sugar breaks down releases sweetness. Garlic and ginger release essential oils rapidly; stir to prevent scorching. Boil broth vigorously to dissolve caramelization and flavor stuck on pan. Season beans well during simmer to infuse flavor; add vegetables once beans near tender to prevent overcooking. Vegetables should be tender but firm—test with fork or finger for bite. Add nuts last—keep crunch contrast. Glaze salmon after searing sides to lock in moisture, baste to coat evenly. Heat control crucial—too high burns glaze, too low leaves sticky and uncooked taste. Fish finishes cooking in glaze’s heat and thickness. Rest fish to redistribute juices; results flakier, not dry or stringy. Serve warm promptly with sauce dribble for glossy appearance."
tips:
- "Pat salmon dry for better sear. Season with salt and pepper before hitting the hot skillet. Resist the urge to flip early—wait for edges to turn opaque."
- "Onions sweat gently. Don't let them brown; that sweetness is key. Garlic and ginger released in bursts. Stir often to keep from scorching. Catch those aromas."
- "Broccoli should be crisp, not mushy. Test by pressing. If it gives, it's ready. Too much steam? Drain excess broth to keep texture right. Balance is crucial."
- "Glaze salmon in the last moments for that sticky finish. Baste often. Watch the syrup; don’t let it burn. Adjust heat as the glaze thickens around fish."
- "Use vegetable stock instead of chicken broth for a vegan option. Or swap almonds for cashews to change texture. Flexibility with ingredients keeps it fresh."
faq:
- "q: Can I use frozen salmon? a: Yes, but thaw completely before cooking. Helps with even cooking. Don’t skip drying for sear."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. Enjoy within 2-3 days. Reheat gently; avoid drying out salmon."
- "q: Why does my glaze burn? a: Too high heat; adjust immediately. A splash of broth can help deglaze pan. Keep stirring! Good flavors shouldn’t scorch."
- "q: Can I add more veggies? a: Absolutely. Snap peas or bell peppers work well. Cut evenly for even cooking. Just make sure not to overcook."
