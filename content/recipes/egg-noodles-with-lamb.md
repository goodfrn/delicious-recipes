ingredients:
- "260 g egg noodles"
- "1 small bulb of fennel finely sliced"
- "20 ml olive oil"
- "180 g spicy Italian sausage casing removed and crumbled"
- "180 g ground lamb"
- "130 ml dry white wine"
- "100 g grated pecorino romano"
- "Salt and freshly cracked black pepper"
instructions:
- "Boil salted water, toss in egg noodles. Stir early to prevent clumps. Cook until firm but not hard, about 7-8 minutes. Taste test—no mush. Drain noodles well. Toss immediately with a splash of oil to avoid sticking. Set aside."
- "While noodles cook, heat olive oil on medium-high in a heavy skillet. Add sliced fennel, sweat until translucent and just starting to brown at edges, about 5 minutes. Sweet aroma should fill kitchen."
- "Turn heat up slightly, add sausage and lamb. Scatter, don't pile. Press down gently. Let sear without stirring for a minute—listen to that sizzle. Break up meat with back of spatula, encourage browning. Keep stirring and crumbling until no pink remains and bits darken, roughly 7 minutes total. Avoid steaming meat by not overcrowding pan."
- "Season with salt and lots of pepper early here. Crucial for flavor build. Splash in white wine to deglaze—listen for the hiss turning to gentle simmer. Scrape pan bottom to incorporate all those crusty fond bits, flavor concentrated."
- "Add noodles directly to skillet. Toss well to coat with meat mixture. Let sit for 1-2 minutes so noodles absorb juices. Finally, sprinkle grated pecorino over top. Stir again until cheese melts slightly, binding sauce."
- "Taste. Adjust salt, pepper. No cheese? Parmesan or aged asiago works fine. No fennel? Use onion or shallot but reduce quantity; fennel cuts richness with brightness."
- "Serve immediately. Let cool slightly if too hot or cheese clumps. Leftovers reheat gently with splash of water or wine to loosen noodles."
introduction: "No fuss pasta dishes that pack a punch. Fatty sausage warmed by earthy lamb, punchy fennel notes cutting through richness. Egg noodles hold sauce better than regular pasta with ridges and soft bite—key for that home-cooked vibe. Wine? Not garnish. It sharpens, refreshes, loosens pan fond, adds background depth. A quick dish but don’t rush key steps. Brown meat properly, deglaze thoroughly; these build final flavor base. Cheese not just topping—active part blending sauce texture and adding saltiness. Simple tweaks like fennel or pecorino turn basic to unique. No complicated steps, just attention and timing. The kind of dish that tastes better if you keep nose in pan and eyes on your food."
ingredientsNote: "Swapped original merguez sausage for spicy Italian to cut some of the lamb’s gamey edge and balance heat. If merguez available and preferred, keep as is but trim excess fat to avoid greasiness. Fennel replaces onion—adds sweet anise undertones that contrast meat richness and wine acidity. If fennel unavailable, shallots or onions are fine but reduce quantity by half to avoid overpowering. Olive oil quantity slightly increased to compensate for reduced sausage fat. Pecorino romano sharper and saltier than parmigiano but melts similarly; adjust salt accordingly. Egg noodles chosen for quick cook time, texture, and gluten content. For gluten-free, use suitable rice or corn noodles but watch cooking time closely and toss immediately after draining to prevent sticking. Hold noodles gently but firmly in hot water—overcooked pasta kills texture here."
instructionsNote: "Salt your pasta water heavily—like the sea. This is your first and critical seasoning layer. Watch noodles carefully; al dente means slight bite just before fully cooked—taste, don’t trust timer blindly. Immediate draining and oiling prevents clumping, especially with egg noodles. Fennel browns in olive oil releasing natural sugars—watch color not just time. Browning meat properly is a must: no crowding or stirring too often. Get golden bits on bottom then stir, crumble quickly, repeat. Fat renders and carries flavor here. Wine deglazing is technique, not decoration. Proper heat control—too low, no sizzle, no fond lift; too high, burns off alcohol and flavors. Tossing noodles in pan allows fats and juices to coat pasta, not just sit on a plate. Cheese folded in at end works as binder creating silkier texture, not just garnish on top. Season midway and at finish, taste throughout. Using spatula back to break meat fine renders texture, no big chunks. For leftovers, gentle heat and moisture addition rescues dryness but avoid microwave nuking which toughens noodles and cheese clumps."
tips:
- "Use plenty of salt in pasta water. It’s crucial. Like the sea. You want that seasoning to penetrate the noodles. Don't skip this step."
- "Fennel browning enhances flavor. Watch closely. You’re looking for slight caramelization. Keep it moving but don’t stir constantly. Get that sweet aroma."
- "Don’t rush the meat browning. Sear until bits stick to pan. Scrape them as you go. That fond builds flavor. Don't overcrowd the pan."
- "Wine deglazing is key. Splash it in, listen for the hiss. Scrape those browned bits into the mix. That’s your flavor booster right there."
- "Cheese isn't just a topping. It’s your sauce binder. Sprinkle at the end, stir until it melts slightly. Creates a silky texture."
faq:
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in an airtight container. Use within three days. Reheat gently. Splash some water or wine to revive."
- "q: What if I can't find pecorino? a: Parmesan works. Aged asiago too. Just adjust salt since pecorino is saltier. Try to use a firm cheese."
- "q: Meat too greasy? a: That can happen. Drain some fat before adding wine. Use leaner sausage. Adjust lamb fat. Balance is everything."
- "q: Can I freeze this dish? a: Yes, but noodles may become mushy after thawing. Freeze in portions. Cook fresh noodles when reheating for best results."
