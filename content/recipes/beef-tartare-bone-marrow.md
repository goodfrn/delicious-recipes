ingredients:
- "4 large beef marrow bones split horizontally"
- "400 g flat iron steak, trimmed"
- "2 large Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled"
- "20 ml mayonnaise"
- "20 g fresh parsley finely chopped"
- "40 g Pecorino Romano finely grated"
- "Extra virgin olive oil"
- "Vegetable oil for deep frying"
- "Salt and black pepper freshly ground"
instructions:
- "Rinse marrow bones thoroughly under cold running water. Submerge in cold water in a large bowl. Cover and refrigerate at least 10 hours to remove blood impurities. This step critical for clean marrow flavor."
- "Preheat oven to 210°C (410°F). Place rack mid-level. Drain marrow bones well and pat dry with paper towels. Lay on baking sheet cut side up. Roast 18-22 minutes until marrow soft but not melting away. Test with spoon: should yield easily without collapsing."
- "Fill a medium bowl 2/3 full with ice cubes and cold water. Nest another bowl over it to create an ice bath for keeping beef cool during chopping."
- "Slice steak into thin strips, then small dice about 3-5 mm. Transfer directly into the chilled bowl. Stir occasionally and keep refrigerated until ready to mix. Cold beef keeps texture and prevents pigment oxidation."
- "Heat vegetable oil to 175°C (350°F) in a deep fryer or heavy pot. Meanwhile, using a mandoline or very sharp knife, cut peeled potatoes into very fine matchstick julienne, about 2 mm thickness. Rinse under cold water repeatedly until water runs clear to remove excess starch."
- "Soak potato sticks in cold water for 10 minutes to firm up. Drain well, then pat completely dry with clean kitchen towels to avoid oil splatter."
- "Fry potatoes in batches, stirring gently for even cooking, about 3-4 minutes until golden and crispy. Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Season immediately with salt. Keep warm or reheat briefly in hot oven before serving."
- "In beef bowl, add mayonnaise, parsley, and a drizzle of good olive oil. Season with salt and cracked black pepper. Stir gently to combine but avoid mashing meat to maintain texture."
- "Plate tartare using a ring mold for clean shape. Spoon warm marrow on top of each portion. Sprinkle with generous Pecorino to add salty, nutty sharpness that contrasts creamy marrow."
- "Serve immediately with potato fries on the side. Tartare cold, marrow warm, fries crisp. Contrast is what defines the dish."
introduction: "Bone marrow paired with raw beef. Rich, gelatinous marrow roasted until just softened but holding shape. Beef diced finely, kept ice cold to preserve freshness and texture. Potato fries thinly julienned, rinsed multiple times, and dried before hot oil bath. Frying at temp brings out golden crisp without sogginess. Pecorino Romano swapped in for sharp complexity over the usual cheese. Parsley instead of chives for herbal brightness. Mayonnaise binds with oil to add moisture. Tartare stacked neatly, marrow spooned warm on top, cheese dusting for bite. Immediate serve needed; marrow cools fast. Play cold hot cold. Keep an eye on crispness of fries during assembly. Every element holds tactile and flavor balance."
ingredientsNote: "Marrow bones often bloody; soaking overnight critical to draw impurities and improve flavor. Use quality grass-fed when possible for best fat profile. Flat iron chosen for tender but still beefy taste, alternative striploin or sirloin works. Yukon Gold best for frying here; waxier than Russet but crisps nicely without drying out. Mayonnaise adds silkiness; can sub mayo for crème fraîche for tang. Parsley brings freshness, substitute with finely minced basil or cilantro for a different profile. Pecorino Romano chosen for sharp umami; other aged hard cheeses fine but avoid overly salty Parmesan which can overpower. Olive oil must be good quality; cheapest oils will taint flavor. For frying, stable vegetable oil like canola or peanut preferred to handle high heat without smoke. Proper drying of potato critical to avoid dangerous splatter."
instructionsNote: "Key is controlling temperatures. Marrow roasting—watch closely; too long and marrow runs off bone and wastes. Want soft but retain some shape to scoop. Cold beef prep essential. Ice bath setup under mixing bowl keeps meat at safe temp; prevents discoloration and texture loss that happens if warm too soon. Dice by hand, uniform small cubes, not pre-ground. Rinsing potatoes repeatedly removes starch that causes clumping and sogginess during frying. Dry-cleaning potatoes before oil prevents dangerous sputtering. Oil temperature monitoring and controlled batch frying keeps fries crisp and golden rather than greasy. Season fries just out of oil to lock salt on surface. Mixing tartare ingredients gently avoids "
tips:
- "Start with good quality marrow bones; soaking overnight helps clear blood. Don't skip rinsing. Drain well before roasting; moisture is key to even cooking."
- "Keep beef cold during prep. Ice bath setup will help maintain temp. Slower oxidation means better texture. Prevents moisture loss too. Dice by hand, short, even cuts."
- "When frying potatoes, the key is drying. Pat dry thoroughly before adding to hot oil. Splattering can cause injury. Monitor oil temp for even cooking. Aim for crispy not greasy."
- "Season the potatoes right after frying. Salt sticks better on hot fries; enhances flavor. Keep in a warm oven if not serving immediately. But check for crispness."
- "Use Pecorino for a sharp bite. Its complexity balances creaminess of marrow. Similar hard cheeses can work too, but taste can differ. Avoid too salty options."
faq:
- "q: How long can I store tartare? a: Best fresh. But if you must keep it, airtight in fridge for up to a day. Monitor for off smells."
- "q: Any substitutes for mayonnaise? a: Yes; crème fraîche adds tangy profile. Also Greek yogurt works. Texture might shift; experiment for preference."
- "q: What to do if potatoes don't crisp? a: High oil temp is crucial. If soggy, they weren't dried well. Next time, ensure they're fully dry."
- "q: Can I use other cuts of beef? a: Sure; striploin or sirloin are good swaps. Watch for tenderness. Trim excess fat for clean texture."
