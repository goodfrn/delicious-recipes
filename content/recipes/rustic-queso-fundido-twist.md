description: "Cheese melts into a bubbling, golden layer infused with sautéed peppers and herbs. Onion and poblano replace original veggies for earthier notes while a pinch of smoked paprika deepens flavor. Cornstarch swaps for flour to prevent graininess. Broiled just until blistered bubbles form, cheese strings pull with the right texture. Lime juice brightens the finish; cilantro adds fresh punch. Cast iron skillet key for even heat and crust development. Watch closely; cheese can burn fast. Serve with crunchy chips or toasted tortillas."

ingredients:
- "2 tablespoons vegetable oil"
- "8 ounces shredded Oaxaca cheese"
- "8 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese"
- "1 teaspoon cornstarch"
- "1/2 cup diced white onion"
- "1/2 cup diced poblano pepper"
- "1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro plus 2 tablespoons reserved"
- "1 jalapeno, finely diced (seeds optional)"
- "2 tablespoons diced roasted red peppers (instead of peppadews)"
- "1 teaspoon smoked paprika (in place of chili powder)"
- "Juice of one lime"
- "Tortilla chips or warm corn tortillas for serving"
instructions:
- "Heat a medium cast iron skillet over medium-high flame until shimmering hot. Swirl in vegetable oil - it should ripple but not smoke immediately."
- "In a bowl, toss cheeses thoroughly with cornstarch. This helps keep melted cheese smooth; no grainy clumps later."
- "Add diced onion, poblano, jalapeno, roasted red peppers, and smoked paprika to the hot oil. Stir often with wooden spoon. Listen for softening; onions become translucent and poblano soft with slight char spots. Around 6-7 minutes."
- "Remove skillet from burner to cool slightly while broiler rack positioned 4-5 inches from heat source gets ready. Preheat broiler on high."
- "Scatter cheese and cornstarch mix evenly over softened veggies in skillet. Gently push cheese into vegetables with spatula but avoid aggressive stirring once cheese starts to string—will clump and tire the texture."
- "Place skillet under broiler. Watch closely. When cheese froths, bubbles burst, edges brown and crust forms, about 4-5 minutes. Don’t walk away—burning can happen fast."
- "Remove skillet carefully with potholders. Immediately drizzle lime juice over top and sprinkle 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro. Serve bubbling cheesy goodness with chips or warm tortillas."
- "If cheese seizes or clumps too much, a quick splash of milk re-smooths before broiling."
introduction: "Melting cheese gets artful here. It’s not just melted—it’s coaxed, coaxed out with layers of sautéed peppers and onions, the smoky whisper of paprika, and that fresh lime pop. Skip the flour; cornstarch nails the silky finish. Swap peppadews for everyday roasted reds and poblano for a deeper, smokier bite. Cast iron makes all the difference; its thick walls distribute heat evenly, creating crusty brown edges while the cheese bubbles away inside. Broiler heat demands attention; one minute too long and the whole effort slips from golden to burnt. Watch for sizzling sounds, bubbling patterns, and that unmistakable aroma of melting cheese melding with charred veggies. Serve hot, stringy, messy—dip in with chips or wrap in tortillas while still warm. No frills, just good technique and solid flavors that stand up to the hype."
ingredientsNote: "Oaxaca and Monterey Jack make a beautiful melty combo; Oaxaca pulls long strings, Jack gives creamy bite. If you can't find Oaxaca, mozzarella is a fine substitute (same stretchy qualities). Cornstarch in place of flour prevents grit—flour sometimes undercooks or makes cheese gummy. Roasted red peppers replace peppadews for accessibility and deeper flavor. Poblano pepper swaps in for jalapeno if you want a milder heat profile but still that thick pepper texture. Fresh lime juice brightens heavy melted cheese; don’t skip it. Cilantro finishes with a hit of herbal freshness that cuts grease. Vegetable oil chosen for neutral flavor and high smoke point, but avocado or light olive work fine too. If you lack a cast iron pan, use an oven-proof stainless steel with a heavy base."
instructionsNote: "Heat oil until shimmering but not smoking—the window between golden and burned is slim. Sauté veggies with patience; onions soft but not caramelized, peppers just tender with slight blistering. Remove skillet during veggie stage to cool slightly; this prevents cheese from seizing on hot pan prematurely. Tossing cheese with cornstarch is crucial; it absorbs excess moisture, helping the cheese stretch and melt without turning oily or grainy. Mixing cheese into veggies: stir gently once it starts stringing—vigorous stirring causes it to congeal unevenly. When under broiler, proximity is everything; 4-5 inches from heat is ideal. Watch bubbles form and pop, cheese turns from pale to golden brown at edges signaling it’s time. Over-broiling makes cheese tough and bitter. Serve right away. For quick fixes, splash cold milk or cream if clumping happens before broiling. Dip chips or tortillas immediately for best gooey stretch."
tips:
- "Heat oil hot enough; shimmering but not smoking. Adds flavor. Vegetables need attention; sauté until soft yet retain some crunch. Skip char; go for tender."
- "Cornstarch is key; blends into cheese for creamy melt. Prevents clumping too. Toss cheese well before adding to veggies.  Avoid agitation; stir gently."
- "Watch those bubbles under the broiler. Four to five inches from heat; timing is tricky. When frothy, smell wafts; edges darken. Pull before burnt."
- "Serving; chips or tortillas are both great. Warm tortillas for soft bites. Layer cheese for gooey pulls. Don’t let it sit; serve hot for best texture."
- "For clumpy cheese, quick splash of milk helps. Mix in while hot. Rescue melted cheese; keep it creamy, not gritty. Always have a backup plan."
faq:
- "q: How to prevent cheese from burning? a: Watch closely under broiler. Four to five minutes max. Take out once golden; edges bubbling, scent shifts."
- "q: Can I use different cheese? a: Yes. If Oaxaca is missing, mozzarella works for that stringiness. Monterey Jack offers creaminess. Mix is key."
- "q: What if cheese doesn’t melt right? a: Check cornstarch using beforehand. It helps. Higher moisture cheese could cause issues too. Always test blends."
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Keep in airtight container, refrigerate; heat with splash of milk later. Watch out for graininess upon reheating."
