ingredients:
- "140 ml sunflower oil"
- "72 ml (about 5 tbsp) tomato paste"
- "50 ml apple cider vinegar"
- "24 ml pure maple syrup"
- "1 small garlic clove minced finely"
- "Pinch of smoked paprika"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Start with a medium bowl. Whisk apple cider vinegar and maple syrup together until maple syrup dissolves completely. The syrup thick, blends slower—patience matters here."
- "Add the garlic and smoked paprika. Smell it; should be sharp but not overpowering. The paprika adds subtle warmth, don’t overdo it or it turns bitter."
- "Slowly pour in the sunflower oil while whisking steadily. This slow addition emulsifies the dressing. Look for a slight sheen and thicker texture—like light mayo but looser."
- "Fold in the tomato paste last. It changes color—deep red—thickens slightly. Whisk until fully combined, no streaks visible."
- "Taste now. Adjust salt pepper balances acidity and sweetness. Add more vinegar if too sweet; more syrup if too tart. Garlic can be adjusted too if too strong or weak."
- "Let rest 5 minutes at room temp for flavors to marry. You’ll notice aromas deepen, and texture a bit smoother as oil and vinegar integrate."
- "Serve immediately over Boston or romaine lettuce. Crisp leaves catch the vinaigrette, each bite has brightness with smoky undertones."
- "Storage tip: Keep refrigerated if not serving right away. Bring back to room temperature and whisk briskly before use if oil firms up."
introduction: "Skip the usual bottled glop. Dressings that settle into oily pools and taste like sugar water. Catalina-style vinaigrette delivers contrast: sweet, tart, smoky, fighting for attention but balanced. Quick to build by hand, no blender needed. Uses tomato paste instead of ketchup to ditch added sugars and control flavor density. Cider vinegar swaps from wine vinegar brings sharper tang and a fruitier aroma. Maple syrup gives more rounded sweetness, less processed than honey here. Garlic minced fine means no lingering chunks but heady punch. The slow drizzle technique emulsifies oil and acid—a must, or you get slick pools, not a creamy coating. Change oils—sunflower, canola, grapeseed—depending on pantry but avoid olive oil; its flavor battles the dressing. The quick wait after mixing lets the components marry, the aromatics peak in scent, texture softens. Keep on hand for salads, grilled veggies, as a dip base—versatile and allergy-safe."
ingredientsNote: "Sunflower oil chosen for neutral flavor and light texture; canola or grapeseed work too. Avoid extra virgin olive oil—it overpowers with bitterness and ruins purity. Tomato paste swapped for ketchup—no unnecessary sugars or thickeners. Tomato paste also boosts umami without diluting. Apple cider vinegar lends sharper fruit notes instead of standard wine vinegar’s earthy base—sub with white vinegar if needed but flavor shifts noticeably. Maple syrup replaces honey for vegan option and deeper sweetness. Garlic needs mincing until fine; larger chunks disrupt texture and cause biting heat. Smoked paprika optional but recommended—for smoky warmth bringing depth. Salt and pepper essential—a pinch too little and bland; too much and it dominates. Can add pinch cayenne for extra heat, but careful, easy to overpower. Fresh ground black pepper preferred over pre-ground for punch. Measure liquids precisely or risk imbalance; too much oil will kill the zing; too little makes it watery and flat."
instructionsNote: "Whisk vinegar and syrup first to dissolve thick maple. Avoid lumps; syrup sinks and tiny bits cause clumping. Garlic added now for flavor integration; minced fine avoids raw sharp chunks. Smoked paprika folded in early so distributes evenly, no clumps or uneven smokes. Drizzle oil slowly while whisking fast to form emulsion. Watch for temporary thickening, the dressing will look glossy and cling to whisk—this signals good emulsification. If added too fast, the dressing splits; no amount of whisking will fix, so start over or add small amount of mustard as binder next time. Add tomato paste last; it emulsifies too thickly if raw. Whisk until uniform, color even deep red. Taste test critical step. Adjust salt, acidity balancing the syrup's sweetness. Let rest 5 mins uncovered for flavors to mingle; dressings fresh taste grassy and acidic, time tempers acidity and unites flavors. Serve at room temp—not cold—thicker texture and stronger taste. Refrigerate if waiting but bring back to room temp with whisking before using. Avoid shaking in a jar without proper emulsifiers. Use immediately for sharpest flavor. Good for 3-4 days refrigerated."
tips:
- "Start with the vinegar, whisk in maple syrup. Dissolving syrup—critical step. Patience. Garlic adds warmth, but too much? Overpowering. Smoked paprika? Just a pinch."
- "Use sunflower oil for neutral flavor. Can substitute canola, grapeseed. Olive oil? Not here! Its flavor battles the dressing. Need a balance. Drizzle slowly while whisking."
- "Adjust flavors before resting. Too sweet? More vinegar. Too sour? Additional maple syrup. Salt and pepper. Essential for taste—don't skip. Freshly ground for best kick."
- "Let sit at room temp; flavors marry. Texture changes—oil and vinegar blend better. Don't rush it. If it firms up in fridge, whisk back to life before using."
- "Storage? Refrigerate. Up to 3-4 days. Lift it back to room temp before serving. Whisk, don’t shake. Keep it smooth, not separated."
faq:
- "q: How to fix it if too thick? a: Whisk in a bit of water or vinegar. Stir gently until you reach the desired consistency. Tweak flavor afterward."
- "q: Can I use a different vinegar? a: Yes, white vinegar works. But the flavor shifts—less fruity. Keep that in mind. Cider vinegar brings a unique sharpness."
- "q: What to do if it separates? a: Whisk it again. Slow mixing helps. If it keeps happening, consider using mustard next time for better emulsion."
- "q: How to amp the flavor? a: Add herbs like basil or oregano. Try cayenne? Only a pinch. Adds warmth without overpowering. Experiment within limits."
