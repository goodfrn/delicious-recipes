ingredients:
- "2 1/2 litres cold water roughly 10 cups"
- "1 whole chicken about 1.3 kg 3 pounds cut in pieces skin removed"
- "1 medium onion quartered"
- "1 large leek sliced thinly separate white and green parts"
- "3 bay leaves"
- "50 ml long grain rice 3 tablespoons"
- "2 medium carrots diced"
- "2 celery stalks chopped"
- "3 large eggs"
- "Juice of 3 lemons"
- "Salt and black pepper ground"
- "Fresh parsley or dill chopped fine for garnish"
instructions:
- "Set a large pot on medium-high, pour in cold water and salt lightly. Add chicken pieces, onion wedges, green leek parts and bay leaves. Heat to a steady boil. Skim foam carefully with a spoon to keep broth clear. Reduce to low heat, cover loosely. Simmer gently 65 minutes until chicken pulls away from bone with little resistance, skinless so broth stays clean."
- "Remove chicken to cool on a plate. Strain broth through a fine mesh sieve into another pot or bowl. Discard solids. Return broth to pot."
- "While broth simmers, clean and chop white leek, carrots, celery. Cut chicken meat off bones once cool enough. Dice into bite-size cubes. Set aside."
- "Bring broth back to a simmer, add rice and chopped vegetables. Let bubble gently, covered, stirring occasionally to avoid rice sticking. Do about 25 minutes, test rice tender but not mushy. Vegetables soft but not falling apart."
- "Meanwhile, in a heatproof bowl, whisk eggs lightly until foamy. Slowly add lemon juice while whisking continuously. Slowly incorporate about 200 ml hot broth to temper eggs and lemon mix, preventing curdling."
- "Take pot off heat momentarily, pour egg mixture into soup slowly while stirring constantly. Put pot back on very low heat. Stir gently, warm soup 1-2 minutes but don’t let it boil or eggs will scramble. Watch texture switch from thin to luscious, almost velvet-like."
- "Add diced chicken back to pot, stir carefully to combine and warm through, 3 more minutes off direct heat. Adjust salt and pepper to taste."
- "Serve ladled into bowls, garnish with fresh herbs like parsley or dill for brightness. No boil after eggs go in. Keep stirring or risk clumping."
introduction: "Forget quick soups that lack depth. Start from scratch with a whole chicken for flavor and body. Water cold to start pulls impurities as it slowly warms. Skimming foam? Mandatory. Keeps broth clear, no cloud. Removing skin cuts grease and sharp porky smells. Leeks split white and green keep the broth clean and veggies textured differently. Rice cooks in the broth, thickening naturally but still toothsome. Carrots and celery bring sweetness and freshness balance to lemon punch. Eggs and lemon whipped to airy smoothness, tempered with hot broth so no lumps, no curds. Temperature control key here. A simmer, never a boil once egg mix hits broth. Garnish fresh, always green herbs to lift the dish. Serving hot and gentle, comforting but with a brightness to avoid dull monotony."
ingredientsNote: "Water-to-chicken ratio matters for clear, rich broth. Larger pot prevents boiling over when simmering long. Whole chicken for bones and meat, skin off or broth gets cloudy. Onion and leek greens add aroma but discard to prevent bitterness. Long grain rice preferred for texture - short grain would turn mushy too fast. If no long grain, use basmati sparingly. Lemon juice amount adjusted for tartness balance, too much overwhelms. Three eggs give richness without heaviness. Fresh herbs interchangeable - dill, parsley, chives all good. Celery stalks add crunch and aroma; no celery? Try fennel bulb chopped similarly for a subtle anise note. For dairy substitute, this soup is naturally lactose free. Low sodium stock cubes can substitute part of the water but watch salt. Skinless chicken or remove excess fat as you go."
instructionsNote: "Start with cold water; hot water will seal chicken proteins causing cloudy broth. Skimming foam isn't decorative; it pulls out fat and impurities, making broth clearer and tastier. Straining removes solids so rice and veggies don’t get overwhelmed with too much debris. Separate leeks white and green so greens add aroma but never overpower with bitterness. Rice’s cooking time varies with quality, test often. Add diced chicken after rice vegetables have softened to avoid dryness. Whisking eggs and lemon ahead is basic but slow tempering with broth crucial to avoid scrambled bits. Pour egg mix into soup off heat or on very low to prevent coagulation; slow stirring helps proteins distribute without clumping. Don’t rush the final warming, patience gives a smooth texture. Garnish at end; heat kills herbs and dulls color and flavor. If soup is too thick, thin with hot water; too thin, simmer gently until slightly reduced. Always taste for seasoning at every stage."
tips:
- "Use a whole chicken. More flavor. Bones make broth rich. Water temp matters. Cold water helps pull impurities. Skimming? Mandatory. Remove foam for clarity."
- "Use long grain rice. Texture matters. Short grain gets mushy fast. Watch cooking time closely. Rice absorbs broth. If too thick, add hot water gradually."
- "Eggs and lemon should be whisked well. Tempering saves you from curdling. Gradually mix hot broth with egg. Do slow and steady. Control temperature."
- "For fresh herbs, choose what’s on hand. Parsley or dill works well. Avoid adding herbs too early. Heat will kill flavor and color. Garnish just before serving."
- "If soup is too salty, add more water. Let it simmer. Adjusting seasoning is key. Taste at different stages. Don't rush; flavor develops with time."
faq:
- "q: Can I use chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken? a: Yes, thighs are good. But bone-in makes richer broth. Remember to adjust cooking time."
- "q: What to do if soup is too thick? a: Add hot water slowly. Stir and check. Adjusting texture is easy. Don't let it boil after eggs added."
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Cool completely. Store in airtight containers. Lasts about 3 days in fridge. Freeze for longer storage; just reheat gently."
- "q: Can't find long grain rice? a: Basmati works in a pinch. But watch cooking time. Different rice types absorb liquid differently. Adjust according."
