- "=== Crust ==="
- "110 g (4 oz) ladyfinger biscuits"
- "50 g (½ cup) coconut flour"
- "65 g (¼ cup plus 1 tbsp) browned butter, melted"
- "=== Coconut Pastry Cream ==="
- "90 g (⅓ cup plus 1 tbsp) granulated sugar"
- "20 g (2 tbsp) arrowroot powder"
- "1 whole egg"
- "4 egg yolks"
- "1 can (400 ml/14 oz) coconut milk"
- "180 ml (¾ cup) heavy cream 35%"
- "70 g (½ cup) shredded sweetened coconut"
- "=== Topping ==="
- "300 ml (1 ¼ cups) heavy cream 35%"
- "25 ml (1 ½ tbsp) powdered sugar"
- "Toasted coconut flakes, as desired"
instructions:
- "=== Crust ==="
- "Set oven rack to middle. Preheat oven to 175°C (350°F). Freeze the butter beforehand for browning effect."
- "Pulse biscuits in food processor until fine crumbs. Add coconut flour. Pour in browned butter, mix until moistened but crumbly, not wet."
- "Press firmly onto base and up sides of 23 cm (9-inch) removable tart pan. Bake 12 minutes until golden edges. Cool completely, minimum 1 hour in fridge. Can sit overnight."
- "=== Coconut Pastry Cream ==="
- "Off heat, in saucepan combine sugar and arrowroot powder. Whisk in whole egg and yolks to smooth blend. Slowly stir in coconut milk and cream."
- "Heat over medium heat, whisk constantly. Scrape saucepan bottom and edges to avoid lumps or burning. Bring to boil, thicken until custard holds heavy spoon coat, about 7–8 minutes."
- "Remove from heat, stir in shredded coconut. Pour immediately into cool crust. Cover surface with plastic wrap pressing down to prevent skin."
- "Refrigerate minimum 3.5 hours or until firm enough to hold. Custard thickens further."
- "=== Topping ==="
- "Whip cream with powdered sugar in chilled bowl until stiff peaks form."
- "Spread evenly over set custard. Sprinkle toasted coconut flakes generously on top for crunch and aroma."
- "Keep chilled until serving. Holds 2 days refrigerated safely."
- "Serve cold, slice with a hot knife for clean cuts."
introduction: "Biscuit crust to start. Ladyfingers crushed fine, blended with grainy coconut flour and nutty browned butter. Goes into oven, quick bake until golden warmth. Cooling needed, no shortcuts. Meanwhile, the filling. Sugar and arrowroot whisked smooth with eggs, creamy coconut milk and real whipping cream mixed in for body. Heat, whisk, scape, heat more. Thick custard, coconut threads stir in last. Into cooled shell, plastic pressed close to prevent skin. Chill long enough to set. Finish with whipped sugar-cream, layered thick, snowy peaks. Toasted coconut flakes scattered on top add texture, bite, and aroma that lingers cold. Refrigerate. Best cold. Simple changes bring depth and texture switch-up from usual flour bump. Keeps well days. Easy slice. Complex taste."
ingredientsNote: "Swapping traditional flour for coconut flour in the crust adds fiber and a hint of coconut fragrance while keeping the base crisp yet delicate. Browned butter instead of plain melted brings a nutty depth contrasting the tart sweetness. Arrowroot powder replaces cornstarch for a clearer, silkier pastry cream with a slight sheen. Using ladyfinger biscuits, light and airy, avoids overpowering the filling. The shredded sweetened coconut is slightly reduced for a balanced chewiness within the custard. The topping uses powdered sugar instead of granulated for smoother whipping and less graininess. Toasted coconut flakes on top add textural contrast and enhance the coconut profile. All dairy stays consistent for richness and mouthfeel."
instructionsNote: "Start with the crust to allow cooling time. Press firmly to ensure structure but not too compressed or it crumbles. Baking is precise; slightly longer brings color and a lightly toasted taste. For custard, temperature control is critical; medium heat and constant whisking prevent lumps or curdling. Scraping the pan edges is vital for even cooking and avoiding scorching pockets. Covering the surface with plastic wrap prevents a thick skin from forming which ruins texture. The chilling phase can be flexible but no less than 3 hours for proper set; overnight is even better to fuse flavors. Whip cream cold, add sugar gradually for stable peaks, but avoid over-beating or it will separate. Assemble just before serving or keep refrigerated tightly covered. Slicing with a warm knife yields cleaner slices. Variations possible with lime zest in custard or swapped toasted nuts for coconut flakes."
tips:
- "Crust first. Press ladyfingers and coconut flour firmly. But not too hard. Bake just until golden. Browned butter is crucial. Adds nutty flavor. Chill it well. Overnight is even better. Don't rush cooling."
- "Curd for pastry is key. Sugar and arrowroot must blend smooth with eggs. Stir slowly when adding coconut milk and cream. Keep whisking constantly. Prevents lumps. Heat to thicken. Scrape edges to avoid burning. Custard needs to hold coat on spoon."
- "Plastic wrap is your friend. Press it to the custard’s surface. Stops skins from forming. Chilling matters. Minimum three hours. Prefer overnight. Fuses flavors richer. Even easier to slice. They will hold shape well."
- "Whip heavy cream in a cold bowl. Add powdered sugar gradually. Stiff peaks are the goal. Don’t overbeat or else it separates. Work quickly. Spread over the custard layer. Touch it lightly with toasted flakes."
- "Slice with a warm knife for clean cuts. Storage is flexible. Up to two days in the fridge. Keep it tightly covered. Can swap toppings. Lime zest in custard is delicious. Nuts are great instead of coconut."
faq:
- "q: Best way to serve this? a: Serve cold is necessary. Slice with a hot knife. Keeps clean. People love it chilled. Flavor melds."
- "q: Can I use substitutes? a: Yes. Swap coconut flour for almond flour. Not the same but works. Arrowroot can be replaced by cornstarch. Custard consistency may vary a bit."
- "q: What's the key to perfect custard? a: Keep whisking. Medium heat is essential. Scrape edges often to prevent burning. If lumps form, blend with an immersion blender. Just a little."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Store in fridge tightly sealed. Good for two days. Keeps well in tart pan. No need to move it. Just slice as needed."
