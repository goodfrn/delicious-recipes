slug: "crab-tarragon-stuffed-eggs"
description: "Halved hard-boiled eggs filled with a creamy crab mixture subtly flavored with dill and lemon zest. Uses Greek yogurt instead of mayo for tang and lighter texture. Tarragon swapped partially for dill, adding a fresher profile. Eggs gently simmered then rested off-heat to avoid overcooking and green yolk rings. Crab chunks folded in carefully to keep texture intact. Garnished with dill sprigs. Adaptable for dairy-free by replacing yogurt with avocado mash or vegan mayo. Yolk reserved for salad topping. Quick chill in fridge before serving to firm up filling. Balance acidity and salt in dressing to avoid overpowering delicate crab flavor."
metaDescription: "Elevate hard-boiled eggs with a crab and tarragon filling for an elegant appetizer. A fresh twist on classic flavors that impresses."

ingredients:
- "12 large eggs"
- "45 ml Greek yogurt or 3 tbsp mayonnaise"
- "20 ml fresh dill, chopped"
- "10 ml fresh tarragon, chopped"
- "15 ml lemon zest and 10 ml lemon juice"
- "1 can (100 g) crab meat, drained"
- "Fresh dill sprigs for garnish"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Bring eggs just to simmer in cold water; once bubbles show around edges, cover off heat. Let sit 9 minutes or until shells move slightly when shaken."
- "Transfer eggs to ice cold water bath immediately. Shell right after cooling; cracks help peel faster but avoid pitting whites."
- "Slice eggs lengthwise; gently scoop yolks into bowl. Reserve 6 whole yolks finely chopped for salad garnish if you want — nice use, don’t waste."
- "Mash remaining yolks with yogurt or mayo until creamy but still slightly grainy. Stir in dill, tarragon, lemon zest, and juice until aromatic but balanced."
- "Fold crab meat in gently, preserve flake structure. Season with salt pepper cautiously: crab’s salty, better add at end."
- "Fill each egg half with a spoon or piping bag, smooth surface for clean presentation. Better with aesthetic care; uneven filling looks clumsy."
- "Chill at least 20 minutes before serving. Filling firms and flavors marry. Top with reserved yolk bits or small dill sprigs for contrast."
- "Serve on cool platter, watch for condensation on serving dish that could soften whites. Use paper towel if necessary, or bring eggs to room temp shortly before serving."
introduction: "Hard boiled eggs aren't just for salads or picnics. Transform with crab for something elevated — subtle herb interplay, creamy texture from yogurt instead of mayo creates brightness, less heaviness. Tarragon usually dominates but here it’s balanced with dill to revitalize fresh flavor while lemon zest injects citrus notes that lift crab’s sweetness. Cooking eggs is deceptively simple. Get just right doneness — no rubbery whites or green yolks. The trick: bring water barely to boil, cover, remove from heat, let residual steam finish eggs. Cooling fast stops overcooking and makes peeling easier. Crab usually comes packed in water or oil; drain thoroughly, flaky consistency vital so filling isn't mush. You want each bite to taste fresh, not overloaded with sauce."
ingredientsNote: "Eggs are foundational — fresh eggs peel easier if slightly older by about 5–7 days. Swap mayo for Greek yogurt for tang and lighter mouthfeel, works well here. Dill paired with tarragon softens the licorice notes tarragon brings, delivering balanced aroma. Lemon zest preferred over just juice; essential oils from zest add depth. Crab meat quantity reduced from original 120g to 100g for less moist filling; problem with watery mix is it runs out of eggs, making presentation messy. If unavailable, canned crab can be replaced with finely shredded cooked lobster or cooked shrimp pieces for twist. Avoid seafood too wet or you'll be fighting moisture balance."
instructionsNote: "Timing is about feel, not clock. Once water bubbles lightly on edges, cover and pull off heat; eggs absorb residual heat, stopping firm whites from rubberizing. Cooling in ice bath quick-stops cooking cycle — no green yolk ring. Shell cracking before peeling hastens process with less jagged whites. Mixing yolks with yogurt or mayo must be done into smooth paste but keep some texture; over-whip = pasty feel. Fold in crab in last step carefully — you want flakes intact, not mashed. Filling compound should be thick enough to hold shape but soft enough for easy piping or spooning. Chill before serving — texture tightens making portioning easier and flavors meld. Reserve yolks chopped as garnish avoids waste, adds rustic charm when sprinkled on salad beds. Presentation counts — neatness signals care. Use fresh dill sprigs rather than heavy garnishes that overshadow base flavors."
tips:
- "Watch the simmering eggs closely. Just to boil. Off the heat, cover. Wait for magic — 9 minutes. Stops them from turning rubbery."
- "Ice bath is your friend. Straight from heat to cold water. Shells slip off easier — no pitting. Fresh eggs can peel tough — older ones better."
- "Mashed yolks, don't overdo it. Yogurt or mayo creates creaminess. Grainy texture is okay. Fold in crab gently to keep chunks intact. Avoid mush."
- "Chilling matters. 20 minutes in the fridge helps filling firm up. Flavors meld, textures improve. Presentation is key — clean, neat edges."
- "Prep ingredients before starting. Have everything ready. It speeds up the process and keeps things organized. When you cook — chaos isn’t helpful."
faq:
- "q: How long to cook the eggs? a: 9 minutes off heat. Adjust based on size. Think about your stovetop. Don't rush."
- "q: What if I don't have crab? a: Lobster or shrimp works. Cooked and shredded. Keeps similar texture. Experiment."
- "q: Can I prepare these in advance? a: Yes, do it a day prior. Store in fridge. Flavor improves but be mindful of moisture."
- "q: What to do with leftover yolks? a: Save for salads. Toss in dressings. Don't waste flavor. Adds depth to meals."
