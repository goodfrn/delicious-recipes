slug: "creole-pecan-glazed-ham"
description: "Slow-baked ham with nutty, spicy glaze. Uses brown sugar, Dijon mustard, maple syrup, and smoked paprika. Pecans replaced with chopped walnuts for texture and earthiness. Slow roast at low heat. Glaze applied near end to caramelize and cling. Water bath keeps ham moist; foil traps steam. Watch for bubbling glaze and golden nuts. Adjust bake time slightly to avoid drying out. Perfect balance between sweet, heat, and nut crunch. Flavors build gradually, not rushed. Smoky paprika swaps heat for subtle depth. Maple syrup replaces honey for richer sweetness and natural caramel notes."

ingredients:
- "Fully cooked bone-in ham 8-10 pounds"
- "1 cup water"
- "1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar"
- "2 tablespoons Dijon mustard"
- "3 tablespoons maple syrup"
- "2 teaspoons smoked paprika"
- "1 1/2 teaspoons Creole seasoning"
- "3/4 cup chopped walnuts"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 270°F. Remove packaging from ham and place flat side down on rack inside roasting pan. Pour one cup of water into pan bottom. Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil to keep moisture locked. Slow roast. Plan for roughly 13 minutes per pound but trust visual and tactile cues over clock. Meat should feel firm but not dry. Juices gently bubbling inside. No brittle crust yet."
- "While ham roasts, prepare glaze. Combine dark brown sugar, Dijon mustard, maple syrup, Creole seasoning, and smoked paprika in medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir frequently. Bring just to simmer - look for slight bubbling edges and thickening. Cook about 3 minutes. Remove from heat immediately to avoid burning sugar. Stir in chopped walnuts for crunchy texture and nutty background note. Set aside."
- "Once ham is evenly cooked and internal temp reads 130-135°F (use probe thermometer if possible), remove roasting pan from oven. Carefully remove foil—watch for steam. Turn ham carefully on its side so glaze can coat entire surface. Pour walnut glaze evenly over ham, spreading with basting brush if needed for coverage. Return uncovered ham to oven at 290°F for about 12 minutes. Watch glaze for bubbling and glossy shine. Nuts should toast lightly but not burn. If edges darken too fast, tent with foil."
- "Remove ham when glaze bubbles fully and ham surface looks caramelized with golden nut crust. Let rest 15 minutes uncovered out of oven before slicing. Skipping rest risks juicy loss when carving. Use sharp chef's knife to slice against the grain for tender bites."
- "If lacking Creole seasoning, substitute with blend of smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, salt and black pepper to approximate flavors. Maple syrup can be swapped with light honey, but adjust glaze cooking time; honey caramelizes faster."
- "Oven temps vary; start checking internal temp early. Avoid overbaking or ham will dry out. Rest time essential for juices redistribution. Use heavy-duty foil to prevent moisture escape."
- "Using walnuts instead of pecans adds robust flavor and crunch contrast. Toasting them slightly in glaze preps oils and aromas to bloom during final bake."
- "Do not skip water in roasting pan—creates steam environment that prevents outside drying before interior warms through. Foil tight seal traps the steam. Without this moisture, ham surface toughens prematurely."
introduction: "Not your standard ham glaze. Pushed the boundaries here with maple syrup swapping honey; offers deeper caramel notes and moisture. Smoked paprika over Creole spice’s cayenne heat—balanced but smoky. Pecan gone, walnuts crackle under heat, releasing earthiness beneath sticky sweetness. Low and slow roast, 270°F, keeps the ham tender, prevents tough edges. Use water bath and tight foil wrap—keeps things juicy. Baste with nut glaze late, let sugars bubble and nuts toast but don't burn them. Timing not gospel—watch glaze bubble and nuts toast for signals. Ham still yields under blade, juice pools slowly. Slicing restful, never hurried. Bold flavors but respect the base meat."
ingredientsNote: "Reducing brown sugar slightly cuts cloying gloss, maple syrup replaces honey for depth and slower caramel burn—maple’s thicker viscosity means better glaze cling. Dijon mustard steadies spice and avoids mustard seed texture sometimes overwhelming the glaze. Smoked paprika swapped in for heat from cayenne brings smokiness that coaxes out richer layers without overpowering. Walnuts introduced for crunch and robust earth, pecans substituted seamlessly but watch final toast time; walnuts toast quicker. Creole seasoning replaced partially—home-blend spices work well if unavailable. Water bath essential; traps moisture, reduces crust cracking, and avoids dried ham edges common in low temp roasts. Heavy foil wrap minimizes steam escape, creating gentle roasting environment."
instructionsNote: "Start with steady, low oven heat; don’t rush. Internal thermometer the real hero here. Foil traps moisture and steam bath prevents drying; check liquid halfway if pan runs dry, add hot water to maintain steam. Slow roast until ham feels firm but moist—poke with finger, slight bounce keeps internal juices holding. Glaze preparation: medium heat only to avoid burnt sugar bitterness; quick simmer thickens, then pull off heat immediately to preserve glaze gloss. Stirring in nuts post heat prevents sogginess. Once glaze’s on ham, return uncovered for caramelization and nut toast. Watch closely: glazing too early or too long causes burnt sugars or bitter nuts; too late, glaze won’t stick or caramelize. Rest ham uncovered after glazing to settle juices before carving—the difference between dry and juicy slices is resting time. Always cut against grain for tenderness."
tips:
- "Prep the ham, flat side down. Place on rack, water underneath. Slow roast to keep it moist. Don’t rush it. 270°F, trust visuals more than time."
- "Make the glaze right, medium heat only. Watch closely to avoid burning. Just a simmer. Add walnuts after heat. Crunchy, nutty, not soggy."
- "Glaze near finishing time. Needs caramelization. 290°F, keep an eye. Bubbles and shine signal it’s working. Too much heat = burnt nuts."
- "Resting is crucial. Let juices redistribute. If you skip it, juicy losses are real. Don't rush slicing; cut against the grain for tenderness."
- "Substitutions exist. If no Creole seasoning, blend your own. Smoked paprika, cayenne, garlic powder. Honey instead of maple syrup if needed."
faq:
- "q: What’s the ideal temp for ham? a: Look for 130-135°F internal temp. Consistent checking is key. Early checks avoid overbaking."
- "q: Can I make the glaze in advance? a: Yes, but heat it before using. Cold glaze won’t adhere or caramelize well. Warmth is crucial."
- "q: What if the ham dries out? a: Check moisture, add hot water if pan is dry. Stay vigilant. Foil wrap prevents drying at low temps."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Wrap tightly in foil or plastic. Fridge for a few days, freeze for longer. Use leftovers creatively—soups, salads."
