ingredients:
- "230 g (1 1/2 cups) mixed mushrooms sliced"
- "80 ml (1/3 cup) extra virgin olive oil"
- "80 g (3/4 cup) finely diced shallots"
- "45 g (1/3 cup) unsalted butter"
- "280 g (1 1/3 cups) arborio rice"
- "150 ml (2/3 cup) dry white wine"
- "1.1 liters (4 1/2 cups) hot vegetable broth"
- "65 g (1 cup) freshly grated Parmesan cheese"
- "2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves"
- "Parmesan shavings for garnish"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Start by heating half the olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and sauté till golden, around 8 minutes. Remove mushrooms and set aside."
- "Lower heat to medium then melt butter in same pan. Add diced shallots, cook until translucent about 4 minutes. Stir in the arborio rice. Toast rice 1.5 minutes stirring constantly to coat grains fully."
- "Pour in white wine, stir till nearly fully evaporated, about 3 minutes. Next, add heated vegetable broth in 275 ml (1 1/4 cup) increments. Stir frequently and let liquid absorb before next addition. Cook for 20-25 minutes until rice is creamy and just al dente. Add more broth if needed."
- "Stir mushrooms back in with thyme leaves. Mix in grated Parmesan cheese, adjust salt and pepper. Cook off heat for 1 minute, let flavors meld."
- "Spoon risotto into bowls. Sprinkle with Parmesan shavings. Drizzle remaining olive oil if desired and add extra black pepper."
introduction: "Switch mushrooms every time. Earthy, wild, cultivated, blend them. Butter meets olive oil, creating layers of fat, some silky, others fruity. Rice needs attention. Med-high heat, stirring. Wine carves into the grain. Broth slowly adds, coats, soaks, keeps it lively. Thyme instead of truffle oil, fresh and less elusive. Parmesan stirs at the end, mingling with mushrooms that waited their turn. Time is slow but not too slow. Risotto requires patience, but bites stay tender and al dente. Season typical. Pepper, salt, no overpower. Garnish sharp cheese shards. Simple. Rustic. Elevated."
ingredientsNote: "Use a mix of mushrooms for texture and flavor: button, cremini, shiitake. Olive oil's fruitiness balances butter’s creaminess. Shallots bring sweetness without bitterness. Arborio rice is traditional, absorbs stock slowly, releasing starch for creamy texture. Replace chicken broth with vegetable broth for vegetarian. White wine acidity cuts richness. Thyme fresh or dried can be used but fresh preferred. Parmesan sharp and freshly grated crucial for melting evenly. Adjust salt carefully as cheese is salty. Parmesan shavings garnish for contrast in texture and appearance."
instructionsNote: "Begin by sautéing mushrooms separately to develop golden crust and avoid sogginess. Use same pan to build flavors sequentially--butter and shallots soften and linger aroma. Toasting rice is quick but important; coats grains but avoids burning. Wine must reduce almost dry for acidity to balance. Add warm stock slowly with patience, stirring frequently to trigger starch release and creamy risotto consistency. Don't rush. Check rice texture often; aim for bite that holds up. Fold mushrooms and Parmesan last to keep textures distinct. Finish with fresh herbs and garnish. Serve immediately for best texture."
tips:
- "Choose mushrooms carefully. Mix types like shiitake, cremini. Each brings different flavors. Button mushrooms okay but bland. Balance texture and taste."
- "Use good quality broth. Heat it up before adding. Cold stock shocks rice and stalls cooking. Warm broth absorbs better. Maintain creamy consistency."
- "Add wine last for depth. Sauce around rice, acidity balances fat. Wait until almost gone. This part crucial to avoid sogginess."
- "Stir constantly. Don't stop or skip this detail. It helps release starch. Creates creamy risotto texture. Avoid burning at the bottom."
- "Adjust salt carefully. Parmesan adds saltiness. Don't oversalt early. Better to taste and adjust at the end. Finish strong with fresh herbs."
faq:
- "q: Can I use different rice? a: Arborio is best. Other types like Carnaroli work. Just check absorbency. Short grain needed for texture."
- "q: Can I make it ahead? a: Yes, but best served immediately. Risotto thickens in fridge. Add broth to restore texture while reheating."
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Store in air-tight container. Fridge for 2-3 days. Reheat gently. Add little broth to loosen it up."
- "q: What if I don't have white wine? a: Use lemon juice as substitute. Avoid vinegar; acidity but very different flavor. Water can work too."
