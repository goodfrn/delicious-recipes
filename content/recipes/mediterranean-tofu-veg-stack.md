ingredients:
- "1 block approximately 400 g firm tofu"
- "100 ml olive oil"
- "3 garlic cloves, finely minced"
- "2 scallions, finely chopped"
- "30 ml fresh thyme leaves, chopped"
- "30 ml tamari sauce"
- "45 ml red wine vinegar"
- "1 large zucchini, sliced diagonally 1 cm thick"
- "1 red bell pepper, cut into 6 strips"
- "1 yellow bell pepper, cut into 6 strips"
- "Salt and cracked black pepper"
- "75 ml fresh mint leaves, chopped"
instructions:
- "1. Slice tofu vertically into 6 thick pieces. Arrange in shallow dish."
- "2. Combine olive oil, garlic, scallions, thyme, tamari, and red wine vinegar. Mix well. Pour over tofu. Refrigerate and marinate minimum 20 hours, or overnight for best flavor."
- "3. Preheat grill to medium-high heat."
- "4. Toss zucchini and bell peppers into remaining marinade. Season with salt, pepper. Let sit 5 minutes."
- "5. Drain tofu and vegetables from marinade, reserving liquid. Place tofu and veggies on grill. Cook each side approx 4 minutes or until grill marks appear and vegetables soften slightly."
- "6. Remove from grill. Stack alternating layers: tofu slice, zucchini slice, bell pepper strip. Drizzle reserved marinade over stacks. Sprinkle fresh mint on top. Serve immediately."
introduction: "Layered tofu chunks with grilled zucchini and peppers. Marinated in a sharp blend of tamari, thyme, and garlic infused olive oil. Swapping balsamic for red wine vinegar changes the tartness profile. Herb variation with mint replaces basil for a fresher, cooler note. Time needed for marinade extended slightly to soak deeper, with hands-on time trimmed. Grilling brings smokiness, charring edges without losing crispness. The red and yellow peppers provide color contrast with the pale tofu and green zucchini. Salt and pepper balance the sweet and tangy marinade. Vegan, gluten-free, and allergen-friendly. Good as starter, light meal, or sharing plater."
ingredientsNote: "Tofu firmness crucial for stacking integrity. Choose firm block to slice neatly without crumbling. If unavailable, press extra water out before marinating. Olive oil amount decreased slightly to reduce oiliness but still enough to coat evenly. Tamari used instead of soy for gluten-free option without sacrificing umami. Thyme swapped in for oregano to introduce woody, slightly minty flavor. Red wine vinegar sharper and less sweet than balsamic, changing acid profile but brighten marinades. Mint chosen to replace basil to provide winter-fresh vibrancy contrasting warm grilled tones. Peppers sliced lengthwise instead of rings to hold better in layered construction."
instructionsNote: "Slice tofu carefully to get even thick slabs essential for stacking without topple. Marinate tofu minimum 20 hours to let flavors penetrate deeply. Longer immersion encouraged if time allows. Vegetables tossed in reserved marinade after tofu removed to prevent over-softening yet impart flavor. Season vegetables separately with salt and pepper before grilling as tofu already seasoned. Grill temperatures need monitoring: medium-high prevents burning. Grill time adjusted to 4 minutes per side for fuller charring and softness without mush. Assemble while warm to keep stack intact and drizzle marinade last to moisten without sogginess. Garnish lastly with fresh mint chopped finely for fragrance release when served."
tips:
- "Firm tofu is key for stacking. Use 400g. Slice 6 generous pieces. Drain excess moisture. This helps avoid crumbling. Slicing thickness matters. 1cm gives balance."
- "Marinate at least 20 hours. Overnight is better for taste. More time, the deeper the flavor. Use a shallow dish for even coating. Flip tofu halfway."
- "Vegetables need attention too. Toss zucchini and bell peppers in marinade. Let sit. Salt and pepper separately. Grilling them enhances sweetness. Char marks are good."
- "Monitor grill temp closely. Medium-high is best for even cooking. 4 minutes per side works well. Check for grill marks and softness. Don't burn."
- "Assembly is critical. Stack while warm. Alternate layers. Finish with drizzle of reserved marinade. Mint garnish before serving. Releases fragrance. Sharp freshness."
faq:
- "q: How long should I grill the tofu? a: Four minutes on each side. Monitor closely. Look for grill marks. Transitioning to a gentler heat can help."
- "q: What can I substitute for fresh mint? a: Basil could work. But flavor changes. Fresh herbs are key. Try parsley too. All depending on taste."
- "q: Can I make this ahead? a: Yes, marinate tofu ahead. Grill veggies close to serving. Keep assembled stacks in fridge short-term. Enjoy fresh."
- "q: What if tofu crumbles? a: Use firm block. Press before marinating. Crumbling may happen with soft tofu. Slice carefully for even thickness. Minimize risks."
