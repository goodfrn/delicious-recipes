slug: "huli-huli-chicken"
description: "Chicken thighs marinated in a tangy-sweet pineapple soy glaze, grilled over medium-high heat. Sauce thickened with arrowroot for a glossy coating. Pineapple slices charred on grill for smoky caramel notes. Balanced with tamari instead of soy and lime juice replacing sherry for brightness. Marinade infused with fresh turmeric replacing ginger, adding earthiness. Marinate 3-5 hours for deep flavor; grill until juices run clear and internal temp hits 165°F. Serve with scallions thinly sliced, sauce spooned over, pineapple rings smoky and tender. Focus on caramelization and thick sauce adhesion. Results juicy, layered, with both sweet and umami punch."

ingredients:
- "1/3 cup dark brown sugar"
- "1/2 cup pineapple juice"
- "1/3 cup ketchup"
- "1/3 cup tamari soy sauce"
- "2 tbsp fresh lime juice"
- "1 tbsp grated fresh turmeric root"
- "3 minced garlic cloves"
- "2 lbs chicken thighs, skin on"
- "2 tbsp arrowroot powder"
- "1/3 cup water"
- "6 pineapple rings"
- "2 scallions, thinly sliced"
- "neutral oil for grill grates"
instructions:
- "=== For the Huli Huli Sauce ==="
- "1. Mix brown sugar, pineapple juice, ketchup, tamari, lime juice, turmeric, and garlic in bowl until sugar mostly dissolved. Fresh turmeric adds earthy warmth rather than sharp zing from ginger."
- "2. Split sauce evenly. Reserve half for marinade. Put remaining half into small pan, bring to very gentle simmer over low heat."
- "3. In separate cup, whisk arrowroot with water until no lumps. Slowly pour into simmering sauce, whisking constantly. Watch carefully. The sauce thickens quickly, glossy sheen appears. Remove from heat promptly to avoid clumping or loss of sheen."
- "4. Set thickened sauce aside for serving. This sticky glaze clings well, perfect for spooning or dipping."

- "=== For the Chicken ==="
- "5. Toss raw chicken thighs with reserved marinade half. Coat well. Cover bowl tightly, refrigerate minimum 3 hours, ideally up to 5 for deeper flavor. Acid from lime tenderizes, but too long makes meat mushy."
- "6. Prepare grill to medium-high heat (about 350°F). Oil grill grates generously—prevents sticking, particularly with sugary marinade."
- "7. Remove chicken from marinade, shake off excess (but do not wipe). Discard leftover marinade - raw chicken juices present contamination risk."
- "8. Place chicken on grill skin side down. Listen for that sizzle — it signals good sear development. Cook about 7-8 minutes per side. Look for well-carved grill marks. Flesh should feel firm but springy when pressed. Use instant-read thermometer to confirm 165°F internal temp for safety."
- "9. While chicken rests under foil, place pineapple rings directly onto grates. Watch carefully — sugar in pineapple caramelizes fast. Should take 2-3 minutes total to get good brown spots and slight char without burning."
- "10. Serve chicken alongside grilled pineapple, drizzle thickened sauce over meat last minute or serve on side for dipping. Sprinkle with thin scallion rings for fresh onion bite."

- "Hints: If grill access limited use broiler but watch closely. Replace pineapple juice with mango nectar in sauce for tropical twist. Arrowroot can be slippery—don't add all at once. Patience pays off; rushing leads to clumps. Avoid over-marinating; lime overcooks protein inside."
- "Note: Thighs hold moisture better than breasts but monitor temp rigorously. Oils on grate prevent sticking, make life easier when flipping. Pineapple's natural sugars burn quickly - constant watching crucial."
introduction: "Skip ginger, go turmeric for earthier tone. Switch soy sauce to tamari for gluten-free and richer umami edge. Cut sherry, add lime juice for fresh acidity. Brown sugar quantity reduced slightly to keep sauce balanced. Arrowroot replaces cornstarch - cleaner flavor, better gloss. Marinate 3-5 hours; enough to infuse without dissolving texture. Grill medium-high but watch carefully for charring without flare-ups. Chicken thighs better than breasts here — stay juicy under intense heat. Pineapple rings get the direct hit for caramelized sweet-sour burst. Sauce simmered low, thickened last to keep bright flavors intact. Use thin scallions on top for fresh crunch and mild sharpness. Avoid wasting leftover marinade by discarding post-marinade — safety first."
ingredientsNote: "Brown sugar is the main sweetener but must not overwhelm acidity in pineapple juice and lime. Arrowroot works better than cornstarch for a clearer, shinier finish; cornstarch tends to dull sauce gloss and can gum up heavier if overcooked. Tamari soy lends deeper color and less salt punch than regular soy sauce — sub carefully if sensitive to salt. Turmeric root grated fresh adds less bite and more earthy complexity compared to ginger—use sparingly to avoid bitterness. Pineapple fresh or canned juice concentrated both work; fresh ensures brighter acidity and fresher aroma. Garlic must be freshly minced for pungency; powder will mute flavor. Chicken thighs with skin deliver richer flavor and crisp when grilled. Neutral oil on grates crucial to prevent sticking; avoid heavy oils that smoke easily."
instructionsNote: "Divide sauce for dual use: raw chicken marinade and cooked finishing glaze. Marinate long enough for flavor infusion but not so long acid breaks down protein fibers turning chicken mushy—usually 3-5 hours ideal. Always discard leftover raw marinade to prevent foodborne illness risk. Grill hot enough for good sear; listen for sizzle. Skin should crisp and grill marks deepen flavor visually and texturally. Internal temp gauge required for safety — 165°F is golden rule for poultry doneness. Pineapple caramelizes with sugar at grill contact; watch timing strictly to avoid burnt bitterness. Finish plated chicken with thickened sauce spooned over or alongside for adjustable sauciness. Scallions add sharp fresh layer that cuts through richness. Use arrowroot slurry carefully to avoid lumps; whisk smoothly and add gradually to simmering sauce."
tips:
- "Marinate chicken for 3-5 hours. Not longer; watch acidity from lime. Too much breaks down protein. Ends up mushy. That’s no good."
- "Oil grill grates well. Use neutral oil, not heavy oils. Prevent sticking. Sugar in marinade can cause real problems. Remember that."
- "Check internal temp constantly. 165°F is key for poultry doneness. Use a good instant-read thermometer. Skin crisps well with heat."
- "Pineapple rings caramelize fast. 2-3 minutes on high heat, flip carefully to avoid burning. Watch sugar; it burns easily. Timing is crucial."
- "If using broiler, keep close watch. High heat means quick results. Flip once for even browning. Slight char enhances flavor."
faq:
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: So many options. Refrigerate in airtight container. Up to 3 days. Freeze after cooling too. Reheat gently."
- "q: What if chicken is undercooked? a: Use thermometer on thickest part. If low, back on grill. Check for firm texture. Juices should run clear."
- "q: What about veggie side options? a: Grilled veggies are great. Zucchini, bell peppers. Toss with oil and seasoning. Same grill time works."
- "q: Can I use chicken breast instead? a: Yes, but monitor closely. Breasts dry out faster. Use brining for better moisture retention."
