description: "Sicilian style ricotta filled turnovers. Fresh ricotta drained overnight, folded with sugar and dark chocolate chunks. A pliable dough with white wine and olive oil, rolled thin and cut into rounds. Fried crisply to golden. Dust with powdered sugar before serving. Keep an eye on dough moisture and frying temperature for ideal texture. Holds a day but best fresh. A slight twist with orange zest and a hint of cinnamon in filling. Almond flour replaces part of the all-purpose for subtle nuttiness and tender bite. Practical tips on draining ricotta and dough handling included."

ingredients:
- "=== Ricotta Filling ==="
- "340 g (1 1/2 cups) whole milk ricotta, drained overnight"
- "85 g (7 tbsp) granulated sugar"
- "85 g (1/3 cup) bittersweet chocolate chunks, 60% cocoa"
- "Zest of 1 small orange"
- "1/4 tsp ground cinnamon"
- "=== Dough ==="
- "180 g (1 1/4 cups) all-purpose flour, sifted"
- "45 g (1/3 cup) almond flour"
- "25 g (2 tbsp) sugar"
- "1/2 tsp fine sea salt"
- "1 large egg"
- "60 ml (1/4 cup) dry white wine, chilled"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) extra virgin olive oil"
- "Vegetable oil for frying"
- "Powdered sugar for dusting"
instructions:
- "=== Ricotta Filling ==="
- "1. Start with ricotta well drained. Use a sieve lined with several layers of cheesecloth or a clean kitchen towel. Cover and refrigerate 10–12 hours. Moisture here ruins dough and filling balance."
- "2. In a bowl combine drained ricotta with sugar, chocolate chunks, orange zest, cinnamon. Mix gently to avoid breaking chocolate pieces too much. Keep cold until assembly."
- "=== Dough and Assembly ==="
- "3. On a clean surface, mound together flours, sugar, salt. Make a well."
- "4. Crack in egg, pour in wine and oil. Using a fork, slowly draw flour in from edges, blending liquids and flour gradually."
- "5. Dough will look shaggy and sticky at first. Switch to hands when too thick to stir. Knead 3–4 minutes until smooth, elastic, slightly tacky but not sticky. If too soft, dust with extra flour sparingly. Over flour dries the dough; balance is key."
- "6. Wrap dough tightly in plastic wrap. Let rest 25–30 minutes at room temp. Rest relaxes gluten, makes rolling easier and prevents shrinkage when frying."
- "7. Cut dough into 4 equal portions. Roll each briefly to rectangular shape to fit pasta machine if available. Keep rest wrapped."
- "8. Roll dough progressively thinner in pasta machine or with rolling pin — target thickness about 1.5 mm (machine setting 5-6). Too thick leads to heavy pockets; too thin tears."
- "9. Use a 5-inch (12.5 cm) round cutter or bowl rim to cut 3 circles per rectangle. Reroll scraps once, but avoid overworking dough."
- "10. Spoon about 30 ml (2 tbsp) filling on one half of each circle, leaving edge free for sealing. Dip finger in water, moisten edges, fold dough over filling."
- "11. Pinch edges firmly from center outward to seal. A fork can be used for decoration and better seal but press gently to avoid punctures."
- "12. Heat frying oil to around 185–190 °C (365–375 °F). Use thermometer – temperature crucial. Too low makes greasy turnovers; too hot burns edges before center cooks."
- "13. Fry turnovers 2 minutes max per side. Colour should be deep golden with small bubbles on surface. Flip carefully to not break seam."
- "14. Remove with slotted spoon to paper towel-lined tray. Let cool 5 minutes to firm up."
- "15. Dust with powdered sugar hot or just warm."
- "16. Eat soon. Keep leftovers covered at room temp max 24 hours. Refrigerate and reheat gently for next day but texture softens."
introduction: "Draining ricotta is non-negotiable. It keeps filling firm but creamy; skips watery runny endings. White wine in dough adds acid to break gluten lightly for flakiness without toughness. Olive oil imparts subtle fruitiness and a supple dough. Almond flour added replaces some regular flour to lend a subtle nuttiness and tender crumb that counters the slight chew of wheat. Chocolate chunks over chips—better melt distribution and pockets of texture. Orange zest plus cinnamon gives traditional filling a fragrant twist while enhancing complexity for palate interest. Roll dough paper-thin and watch it; thick dough won’t crisp, thin tears. Fry hot and quick, no soaking in oil. Visual signals are the key, not clock."
ingredientsNote: "Ricotta must be drained well; overnight refrigeration ideal. Use whole milk ricotta, part-skim dries out filling. Granulated sugar can be swapped for superfine for better dissolution. Chocolate quality matters — opt for chunks over chips for texture contrast and melting behavior. Orange zest needs to be bright, not bitter white pith. Ground cinnamon optional but adds depth. Dough substitutes: almond flour isn’t required but improves the texture and flavor. White wine contributes acid for dough extensibility and flavor; use a dry version like Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc. Olive oil should be mild, not peppery to avoid overpowering dough. Vegetable oil for frying can be sunflower or canola; avoid strong flavored oils. For dusting, powdered sugar balanced with fine cinnamon powder on top can be tasty alternative. Keep ingredients cool especially liquids if ambient temps are warm, dough gets sticky fast."
instructionsNote: "Drain ricotta using multiple layers of cheesecloth for fine texture, and avoid squeezing which can make filling dense. When mixing dough, incorporate wet ingredients gradually into flour well to control hydration and observe dough texture. Kneading activates gluten forming structure; stop as soon as the dough is smooth and elastic. Resting dough isn’t optional; it relaxes gluten network, best results rolling thin and prevents shrinkage in oil. Roll dough in stages, on floured surface, limiting extra flour use on dough to avoid toughening crust. Cut rounds cleanly—jagged edges increase risk of oil seeping in, causing sogginess. Seal edges firmly; a little water acts as glue. Fry in small batches to keep oil temperature stable. Look for bubbles and golden color not just exact time. Drain turnovers quickly on racks or paper towels to absorb excess oil and avoid sogginess. Dusting with sugar while warm allows slight melting and adhesion. Leftovers get softer; reheat in moderate oven to crisp again. Avoid freezer storage—dough and filling don’t reheat well frozen."
tips:
- "Drain ricotta overnight. Crucial; don’t skip. Use layered cheesecloth. Avoid squeezing. Water ruins filling balance."
- "Egg brings richness; don’t overdo. Dry white wine helps dough; adds flakiness. Use only mild olive oil, avoids overpowering flavors."
- "Knead till smooth but slightly tacky; avoid too much flour. Wrapping dough lets it relax. Easier to roll thin."
- "Oil temperature is key. Too hot burns; too low makes soggy. Use a thermometer. Look for deep golden color, small bubbles."
- "Dust with powdered sugar while warm. Melted adherence helps. Leftovers soften; reheat gently. Avoid freezing. Dough and filling don’t hold texture."
faq:
- "q: How to drain ricotta properly? a: Use cheesecloth, layered. Let sit overnight, no pressure. Desired texture; avoid soggy filling."
- "q: What if dough feels too sticky? a: Add flour sparingly. Too much dries it out. Knead gently, watch moisture balance."
- "q: Best way to store turnovers? a: Keep covered at room temp. Refrigerate overnight if needed. Revision risk for texture."
- "q: Can I freeze these turnovers? a: Better fresh. Freezing ruins texture. Dough won’t reheat well. Use immediately."
