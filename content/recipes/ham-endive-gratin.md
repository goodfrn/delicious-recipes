ingredients:
- "===Braising Endives==="
- "8 large endives halved lengthwise"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) lemon juice"
- "7 ml (1 1/2 tsp) maple syrup"
- "Salt and black pepper"
- "===Creamy Sauce==="
- "60 ml (4 tbsp) butter"
- "1 clove garlic minced"
- "60 ml (4 tbsp) whole wheat flour"
- "400 ml (1 2/3 cups) milk"
- "200 ml (3/4 cup) aged cheddar shredded"
- "50 ml (1/4 cup) grated Parmesan"
- "Smoked paprika to taste"
- "12 slices thin turkey ham"
instructions:
- "===Braised Endives==="
- "Preheat oven to 200 °C (390 °F). Arrange endives cut side up in baking dish about 33 x 23 cm (13 x 9 in). Sprinkle lemon juice and drizzle maple syrup over them. Season with salt and pepper. Cover tightly with foil. Bake 28-33 minutes until tender but not mushy. Drain liquid and let cool."
- "===Cheese Sauce==="
- "In saucepan, melt butter with garlic on medium-low. Stir in flour, cook 1-2 minutes stirring constantly to form roux. Slowly whisk in milk in stages, bring to simmer while whisking to avoid lumps. Remove from heat, fold in cheddar and Parmesan. Add smoked paprika, salt and pepper to taste. Keep warm."
- "===Assembly and Bake==="
- "Increase oven temperature to grill (broil) setting. Wrap each endive half in 1 slice turkey ham, place snugly back in dish. Spoon cheese sauce over each piece to cover. Place under broiler about 6-8 minutes until bubbly and golden brown on top. Watch carefully to avoid burning."
- "Serve immediately. Could be main dish with rice or a hearty side with roast meat."
introduction: "Bitter-sweet endives, split and steamed in lemon and maple. Honey swapped for syrup, slight tang but sweeter. Cheese sauce thickened, with rich sharp cheddar and nutty Parmesan. Garlic butter base. Nutmeg tossed aside for smoky paprika dusting. Wrap each half with turkey ham slices — lighter, less salty than standard ham. Oven time pushed just a bit longer to get them tender, no sog. Final broil adds crisp, golden crust, bubbling cheeses covering each portion. Can go main or side; four plates, or eight smaller portions. Ends soft within, smoky cheese crisp outside. Almost rustic, almost festive."
ingredientsNote: "Endives hold bitterness, tamed by lemon acidity and natural sweetness from syrup. Maple syrup chosen over sugar for depth. Whole wheat flour thickens sauce, adds subtle nutty flavor and texture. Use aged cheddar to bring sharpness to cheese blend; Parmesan adds complexity and crust color. Garlic hovers beneath, essential but subtle.Add smoked paprika, layers smoky flavor to replace musky nutmeg. Turkey ham is leaner, less intense, keeps dish lighter and balanced.Use fresh endives, firm and pale; they braise down to silky. Cheese gratings better fresh-shredded over powders or pre-grated. Butter with garlic gentle, no brown allowed—keep it bright to avoid bitterness. Adjustment of oven temps and times important, endives should not be mushy but tender enough to bite through smoothly."
instructionsNote: "Keep foil tight on braising step to trap steam, ensures softness inside without drying out. Drain endives well after braising to avoid watery sauce. Roux must cook 1-2 minutes to get rid of raw flour taste but no color change, keep gentle stirring. Add milk gradually, whisk to smooth sauce, avoid lumps. Cheese mixed off-heat so no grainy texture; melt slowly with residual heat. Wrap endives firmly but not tight to avoid breaking. Spread sauce over carefully, do not soak too much, the cheese should form protective crust. Broil short time only—watch every minute. Burnt cheese ruins subtle flavors here. Serve right from oven; sauce firms on cooling, loses creaminess. Best warm, freshly baked crisp with tender, juicy endives inside."
tips:
- "Endives can be bitter. Balance this with the acidity of lemon juice. Use fresher endives for best results. Firm, pale ones braise perfectly. Trim any rough ends before prep. Drain well post-braiding. Better texture for your sauce."
- "Sauce technique is crucial. Roux needs stirring. No need for browning, just cook enough to remove raw taste. Gentle heat is key. Gradual milk addition avoids lumps. Whisk constantly. Avoid the grainy texture."
- "Broiling is delicate. Watch closely. Don’t burn cheese. Golden is better. Broil for around 6-8 minutes. Adjust oven settings if necessary. Use lower rack for gentle heat. Crisp top without overcooking inside."
- "Wrap the endives well but don’t overdo. Tight will break ham. Loose lets sauce seep in. You want to maintain that structure. Spread sauce carefully. Too much can drown the balance. Keep it moderate."
- "Serving hot is best. Let cool leads to saucy mess. Crust falls apart. Serve right after cooking for that texture. If not, sauce will firm up. Cover dish with foil if holding for longer before serving."
faq:
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate them in airtight container. Use within 2-3 days for best quality. Reheat gently. Avoid microwave when possible. Oven retains texture."
- "q: Can I use other meats? a: Yes, substitute turkey ham with prosciutto or even chicken. Adjust cooking times. They may alter flavors slightly. Try with bacon for smokiness."
- "q: Can I use different cheeses? a: Absolutely, mix cheeses like gouda or mozzarella. Experiment with flavors. Just ensure melting quality similar. Test thickness in sauce."
- "q: What alternatives to butter? a: Use olive oil or vegan butter. They change taste and texture. Adjust amount accordingly. It’s about the base; richness will differ."
